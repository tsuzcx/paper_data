The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of copper (~17.5 times 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n/degC) is a few times higher than that of silicon (~2.5 times10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n/degC). Thus, when the copper filled through silicon via (TSV) is subjected to temperature loadings, there is a very large local thermal expansion mismatch between the copper and the silicon/dielectric (e.g., SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n), which will create very large stresses and strains at the interfaces between the copper and the silicon and between the copper and the dielectric. These stresses/strains can be high enough to introduce delamination between the interfaces. In this paper, the nonlinear thermal stresses and strains at the interfaces between the copper, silicon, and dielectric have been determined for a wide-range of aspect ratios (of the silicon thickness and the TSV diameter). One of the major applications of TSV is as an interposer. Because of Moore's (scaling/integration) law, the silicon chip is getting bigger, the pin-out is getting higher, and the pitch is getting finer. Thus, the conventional substrates, e.g., BT (bismaleimide triazine) cannot support these kinds of silicon chips anymore and a silicon interposer (substrate) is needed to redistribute the very fine-pitch and high pin-count pads on the chip to much larger pitch and less pin-count through the silicon vias on the silicon substrate. Depending on the via-size and pitch of the copper filled TSV, the effective CTE of the copper filled TSV interposer could be as high as 10 times 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n/degC. Consequently, the global thermal expansion mismatch between the silicon chip and the copper filled TSV substrate can be very large and the bumps (usually very small, e.g., microbumps) between them may not be able to survive under thermal conditions. In this study, the nonlinear stresses and strains in the microbumps between the silicon chip and copper filled TSV interposer (with and without underfills) have been determined for a wide-range of via sizes and pitches, and various temperature conditions. These results should be useful for 1) making a decision if underfill is necessary for the reliability of microbumps and 2) selecting underfill materials to minimize the stresses and strains in the microbumps.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170003/","volume":"32","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5170003/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10950203","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Thermal Stress/Strain Analyses of Copper Filled TSV (Through Silicon Via) and Their Flip-Chip Microbumps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Thermal Stress/Strain Analyses of Copper Filled TSV (Through Silicon Via) and Their Flip-Chip Microbumps","sourcePdf":"tadvp-cselvanayagam-2021661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082851S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"5286959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"5286959","articleId":"5170003","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5170004,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Joo Lee","affiliation":["R&E Center, Whirlpool Corporation, Benton Harbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/5170004/5170004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-Joo Lee (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University of Technology and Education, Cheon-An, Korea, in 1996, the M.S. degree from Gwang-Woon University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree, focusing on the integrated bidirectional converter for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, from the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, in 2009.","In 1995, he joined SunStar R&C, Incheon, Korea, which is highly specialized in industrial sewing machines, motors, and their controllers.

Plug-in HEVs (PHEVs) are HEVs with plug-in capabilities and provide a more all-electric range; hence, PHEVs improve fuel economy and reduce emissions even more. PHEVs have a battery pack of high energy density and can run solely on electric power for a given range. The battery pack can be recharged by a neighborhood outlet. In this paper, a novel integrated bidirectional AC/DC charger and DC/DC converter (henceforth, the integrated converter) for PHEVs and hybrid/plug-in-hybrid conversions is proposed. The integrated converter is able to function as an AC/DC battery charger and to transfer electrical energy between the battery pack and the high-voltage bus of the electric traction system. It is shown that the integrated converter has a reduced number of high-current inductors and current transducers and has provided fault-current tolerance in PHEV conversion.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2028070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2028070","startPage":"3970","endPage":"3980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/05170004.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Integrated Bidirectional AC/DC and DC/DC Converter for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Integrated Bidirectional AC/DC and DC/DC Converter for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles","volume":"58","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10903080","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5170004/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Integrated Bidirectional AC/DC and DC/DC Converter for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tvt-lee-2028070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079768S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"268","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"5170004","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5170012,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Schaltz","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5277109/5170012/5170012-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erik Schaltz (M'08) was born in Viborg, Denmark, in 1981.

Often, the battery is rated with respect to its energy requirement to reduce its volume and mass. This does not prevent deep discharges of the battery, which are critical to the lifetime of the battery. In this paper, the ratings of the battery and ultracapacitors are investigated. Comparisons of the system volume, the system mass, and the lifetime of the battery due to the rating of the energy storage devices are presented. It is concluded that not only should the energy storage devices of a FCHEV be sized by their power and energy requirements, but the battery lifetime should also be considered. Two energy-management strategies, which sufficiently divide the load power between the fuel cell stack, the battery, and the ultracapacitors, are proposed. A charging strategy, which charges the energy-storage devices due to the conditions of the FCHEV, is also proposed. The analysis provides recommendations on the design of the battery and the ultracapacitor energy-storage systems for FCHEVs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170012/","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5170012/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10903081","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Battery/Ultracapacitor Energy-Storage Sizing on Battery Lifetime in a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Battery/Ultracapacitor Energy-Storage Sizing on Battery Lifetime in a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle","sourcePdf":"tvt-khaligh-2027909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082774S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"232","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"5170012","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5170017,"authors":[{"name":"Meng-Jia Jin","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"p":["Meng-Jia Jin was born in Wenzhou, China, in 1980.

The embedded signal will not alternate the system spectral efficiency. By watermarking theory, we demonstrate the required embedded level for watermarking signal to achieve a given bit error probability in different circumstance.

Under different uncertainty assumptions, the model design problem is posed either as a min-max optimisation problem or stochastic minimization problem on the RER between joint laws describing the state and output processes (rather than the more usual RER between output processes). A suitable filter is proposed for which performance results are established which bound conditional mean estimation performance and show that estimation performance improves as the RER is reduced. These filter consistency and convergence bounds are the first results characterizing multiple HMM approximation performance and suggest that joint RER concepts provide a useful model selection criteria. The proposed model design process and MHMM filter are demonstrated on an important image processing dim-target detection problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative Entropy Rate Based Multiple Hidden Markov Model Approximation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2028115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05170052.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2028115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5170052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Relative Entropy Rate Based Multiple Hidden Markov Model Approximation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5170052/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020526","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative Entropy Rate Based Multiple Hidden Markov Model Approximation","sourcePdf":"57tsp12-jlai-2028115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102884S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5170052","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":5170056,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Nordio","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5353758/5170056/5170056-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Nordio (S'00\u2013M'03) was born in Susa, Italy, in 1974 He received the Laurea degree in telecommunications engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Italy, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree from \u00c9cole Politechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland, in April 2002.","From 1999 to 2002, he was with the Mobile Communications Department, Institut Eur\u00e9com, Sophia-Antipolis, France, as a Ph.D. student.

In this paper, we present a new automated scheme for segmenting lung lobes depicted on 3-D CT examinations. The unique characteristic of this scheme is the representation of fissures in the form of implicit functions using radial basis functions (RBFs), capable of seamlessly interpolating ldquoholesrdquo in the detected fissures and smoothly extrapolating the fissure surfaces to the lung boundaries resulting in a ldquonaturalrdquo segmentation of lung lobes. A previously developed statistically based approach is used to detect pulmonary fissures and the constraint points for implicit surface fitting are selected from detected fissure surfaces in a greedy manner to improve fitting efficiency. In a preliminary assessment study, lobe segmentation results of 65 chest CT examinations, five of which were reconstructed with three section thicknesses of 0.625 mm, 1.25 mm, and 2.5 mm, were subjectively and independently evaluated by two experienced chest radiologists using a five category rating scale (i.e., excellent, good, fair, poor, and unacceptable). Thirty-three of 65 examinations (50.8%) with a section thickness of 0.625 mm were rated as either ldquoexcellentrdquo or ldquogoodrdquo by both radiologists and only one case (1.5%) was rated by both radiologists as ldquopoorrdquo or ldquounacceptable.rdquo Comparable performance was obtained with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm, but substantial performance deterioration occurred in examinations with a section thickness of 2.5 mm. The advantages of this scheme are its full automation, relative insensitivity to fissure completeness, and ease of implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2009.2027117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"1986","endPage":"1996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2009.2027117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331296","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5331296/05170058.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface fitting","Computed tomography","Lungs","Diseases","Image segmentation","Surface treatment","Surface reconstruction","Radiology","Process planning","Anatomy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","diagnostic radiography","image reconstruction","image segmentation","medical image processing","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulmonary lobe segmentation","CT examinations","computed tomography","implicit surface fitting","radial basis functions","image reconstruction","radiology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computed tomography (CT)","computer-aided diagnosis","lobe segmentation","radial basis function (RBF)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Humans","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Lung","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive","Radiographic Image Enhancement","Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Tomography, X-Ray Computed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation in CT Examinations Using Implicit Surface Fitting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170058/","volume":"28","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5170058/","accessionNumber":"10995370","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"19628453","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation in CT Examinations Using Implicit Surface Fitting","sourcePdf":"tmi-jpu-2027117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107503S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5331296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5331296","articleId":"5170058","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5170060,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5446566/5170060/5170060-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ran Tao (M\u201900\u2013SM\u201904) was born in Nanling County, Anhui Province, China, in 1964.

It displays the time and FRFD-frequency information jointly in the short-time fractional Fourier domain (STFRFD). Two aspects of its performance are considered: the 2-D resolution and the STFRFD support. The time-FRFD-bandwidth product (TFBP) is defined to measure the resolvable area and the STFRFD support. The optimal STFRFT is obtained with the criteria that maximize the 2-D resolution and minimize the STFRFD support. Its inverse transform, properties and computational complexity are presented.

Our method relies on the differences in the spatial characteristics of the absorption coefficient and the optical energy density within the medium. By using sparse-representation based decomposition, we exploit these different characteristics to extract both the absorption coefficient and the photon density within the imaged object from the optoacoustic image. In contrast to previous methods, this algorithm is not based on the solution of theoretical light transport equations and it does not require explicit knowledge of the illumination geometry or the optical properties of the object and other unknown or loosely defined experimental parameters, leading to highly robust performance. The method was successfully examined with numerically and experimentally generated data and was found to be ideally suited for practical implementations in tomographic schemes of varying complexity, including multiprojection illumination systems and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) studies of tissue biomarkers.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2009.2027116","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5331296/05170062.pdf","startPage":"1997","endPage":"2006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2009.2027116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5331296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Optoacoustic Signal Extraction Using Sparse Signal Representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5170062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170062/","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Optoacoustic Signal Extraction Using Sparse Signal Representation","volume":"28","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10995379","pubMedId":"19628454","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5170062/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Optoacoustic Signal Extraction Using Sparse Signal Representation","sourcePdf":"tmi-arosenthal-2027116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071662S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5331296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5331296","articleId":"5170062","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5170063,"authors":[{"name":"Svyatoslav Sergeevich Pavlichkov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore","Department of Differential and Integral Equations, Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, V.I.

When using a personal computer with commercial audio hardware for teleconferencing, a sampling frequency offset between the loudspeaker output D/A converter and the microphone input A/D converter often occurs. In this case, state-of-the-art echo cancellation algorithms fail to track the correct room impulse response. In this paper, we present a novel least mean square (LMS-type) adaptive algorithm to estimate the frequency offset and resynchronize the signals using arbitrary sampling rate conversion. In conjunction with a normalized LMS-type adaptive filter for room impulse response tracking, the proposed system widely removes the deteriorating effects of a frequency offset up to several Hz and restores the functionality of echo cancellation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Sampling methods","Internet telephony","Adaptive filters","Loudspeakers","Microphones","Frequency conversion","Echo cancellers","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","echo suppression","Internet telephony","least mean squares methods","speech processing","teleconferencing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive sampling rate correction","acoustic echo control","voice-over-IP","speech communication","adaptive filters","teleconferencing","loudspeaker output D/A converter","microphone input A/D converter","least mean square adaptive algorithm","echo cancellation functionality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic signal processing","adaptive filters","echo suppression","interpolation","least mean squares methods","resampling","teleconferencing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2028187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05170064.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2028187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sampling Rate Correction for Acoustic Echo Control in Voice-Over-IP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5170064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sampling Rate Correction for Acoustic Echo Control in Voice-Over-IP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170064/","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5170064/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11020510","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sampling Rate Correction for Acoustic Echo Control in Voice-Over-IP","sourcePdf":"tsp-pawig-2028187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055728S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5170064","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5170065,"authors":[{"name":"Miklos Gyongy","affiliation":["Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K."],"firstName":"Miklos","lastName":"Gyongy","id":"37992632900"},{"name":"Constantin-C.

Inertial cavitation has been previously shown to result in increased heat deposition and to be associated with broadband noise emissions that can be readily monitored using a passive receiver without interference from the main HIFU signal. In the present study, the signals received passively by each of 64 elements on a standard diagnostic array placed coaxially with the HIFU transducer are combined using time exposure acoustics to generate maps of inertially cavitating regions during HIFU exposure of an agar-based tissue-mimicking material. The technique is shown to be effective in localizing single-bubble activity, as well as contiguous and disjoint cavitating regions instigated by creating regions of lower cavitation threshold within the tissue phantom. The cavitation maps obtained experimentally are also found to be in good agreement with computational simulations and theoretical predictions. Unlike B-mode imaging, which requires interleaving with the HIFU pulse, passive array-based mapping of cavitation activity is possible during HIFU exposure. If cavitating regions can be directly correlated to increased tissue damage, this novel cavitation mapping technique could enable real-time HIFU treatment monitoring.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","volume":"57","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11054138","pubMedId":"19628450","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5170065/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Passive Spatial Mapping of Inertial Cavitation During HIFU Exposure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive Spatial Mapping of Inertial Cavitation During HIFU Exposure","sourcePdf":"tbme-gyngy-2026907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137722S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5374004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5374004","articleId":"5170065","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5170067,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37310511100"},{"name":"Jianping Yao","affiliation":["Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Yao","id":"37280659900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5170067","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":535},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fourier transforms","Optical pulse shaping","Pulse shaping methods","Optical pulses","Pulse compression methods","Gratings","Optical reflection","Optical design","Reflectivity","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","Fourier transform optics","optical fibre dispersion","optical pulse compression","optical pulse shaping","reflectivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transform ultrashort optical pulse shaping","single linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating","LCFBG","temporal pulse stretching","pulse spectrum","temporal pulse compression","spectrum-shaped pulse","grating power reflectivity function","grating reflection response","temporal optical waveform","subpicosecond regime","triangular optical pulse synthesis","chromatic dispersion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chromatic dispersion","fiber Bragg grating (FBG)","Fourier synthesis","optical pulse shaping"]}],"abstract":"Fourier transform ultrashort optical pulse shaping using a single linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating (LCFBG) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated in this letter.

The impulse response of the entire pulse shaping system is equal to the Fourier transform of the square of the grating power reflectivity function.

It is assumed that for each user, perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at its transmitter and receiver. The exact asymptotic spectral efficiency of large MIMO ad hoc networks has been considered to be an unsolved problem until now. A lower bound has been found by Chen and Gans based on using beamforming as a sub-optimal transmission scheme. In this work, we show that the previously presented lower bound is also an upper bound when L goes to infinity, all links use full power and single-user decoding is used; hence, it represents the exact asymptotic spectral efficiency (ASE) of the network.

The primary advantage of the proposed approach is that the figures of merits can be calculated by accounting not only for the topology of the interface but also for the structure and characteristics of the controller adopted for the interface itself.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2027246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5427230/05170073.pdf","startPage":"1195","endPage":"1207","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2027246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing the Dynamic Performances of Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Interfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Comparing the Dynamic Performances of Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Interfaces","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5170073/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168823","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170073/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing the Dynamic Performances of Power Hardware-in-the-Loop Interfaces","sourcePdf":"tie-lentijo-2027246.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07125S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5427230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"5427230","articleId":"5170073","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5170076,"authors":[{"name":"Zoran Salcic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"p":["Zoran Salcic (SM'97) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia, in 1972, 1974, and 1976, respectively.

Accurate and fast measurement of frequency is a goal required in many applications, for example, for load shedding. An improved Taylor approximation method (ITAM) algorithm is proposed, and a comparison of the new algorithm with the conventional Taylor approximation method (TAM) algorithm is presented in this paper under the assumption of the presence of a direct-current (dc) offset component, higher order harmonics, and random noise in the power system signal. The proposed ITAM has the characteristics of low computational and simple hardware requirements, as well as more accurate measurement performance. Another key feature of the algorithm is a good tracing ability for the frequency change and measurement of rate of change of the frequency of a power system. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170076/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","volume":"58","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10816326","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5170076/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Improved Taylor Method for Frequency Measurement in Power Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Taylor Method for Frequency Measurement in Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tim-salcic-2022377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055286S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5200743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5200743","articleId":"5170076","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5170081,"authors":[{"name":"Mahesh K.

The sensors transmit their observations over a multiple access fading channel to a fusion center (FC), where a source parameter is estimated. The sensor transmissions add incoherently over a multiple access channel, which motivates the need for channel knowledge at the sensors to improve performance. We consider the effects of different fading channel models on the performance of the system, and characterize the effect of different amounts of channel information at the sensors. We calculate the variance of the estimate for cases when both perfect, and differing amounts of partial channel information are available at the sensors. Asymptotic variance expressions for large number of sensors are derived for different channel statistics and feedback scenarios. We show that the degradation in variance due to using only channel phase information is at most a factor of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4/\u00bf</i>\n over Rayleigh fading channels. We consider continuous feedback error and evaluate the degradation in performance due to differing degrees of error. The loss in performance due to feedback quantization, and effect of error in feedback are also quantified. We also consider speed of convergence, and compare the rate of convergence under different conditions. Further, we characterize the effect of correlated channels between sensors and the FC, and provide the different values for the speed of convergence for this case. Simulation results are provided to show that only a few tens of sensors are required for the asymptotic results to hold. Numerical results corroborate our analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2028196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05170081.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2028196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","startPage":"414","endPage":"425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation Over Fading Channels With Limited Feedback Using Distributed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5170081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation Over Fading Channels With Limited Feedback Using Distributed Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170081/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020547","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5170081/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation Over Fading Channels With Limited Feedback Using Distributed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tsp-tepedelenlioglu-2028196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083923S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5170081","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5170083,"authors":[{"name":"Mohan M.

A simple technique for the selection of switching states to constitute the reference vector is proposed here. The computational cost of the proposed technique is independent of voltage levels of inverter. This technique is easy to implement online in digital controller. The tradeoff between quality of output voltage and CMV is achieved in this paper.

However, high cost and slow dynamic response of FC still persist as the main hurdles for wider applications. To remedy this problem, an energy storage system with adequate power capacity has to be incorporated. This paper presents a novel control design for FC-battery hybrid power system which enables both active current sharing and power source management control in such hybrid systems. Different hybrid power system structures are investigated and evaluated; dual-converter structure and four modes of operation are defined to provide efficient and sustainable solution to such a hybrid power system. A novel integrated control system with inherent current sharing and generation mode swapping capability is proposed; based on system component status, the control system is able to regulate the output power from each source under different scenarios. The dedicated control system is implemented in a TMS320F2812 DSP, and experimental results for an FC-battery-based uninterruptible power supply are provided to demonstrate the static and dynamic performance of the control system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2027249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379132","startPage":"752","endPage":"761","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5379132/05170092.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Current Sharing and Source Management in Fuel Cell\u2013Battery Hybrid Power System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5170092/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Active Current Sharing and Source Management in Fuel Cell\u2013Battery Hybrid Power System","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054640","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Current Sharing and Source Management in Fuel Cell\u2013Battery Hybrid Power System","sourcePdf":"tie-jiang-2027249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091859S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5379132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"5379132","articleId":"5170092","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5170094,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Holst Centre, Stichting IMEC Nederland, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5312990/5170094/5170094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Wang received the B.E. and Do.E. degrees in electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in June 2001 and June 2006, respectively.","Since August 2000 to February 2001, he had an internship on the design and implementation of a microcontrol unit with Motorola Electronics Ltd.

In most sensor positioning systems, sensors and beacons need to emit ranging signals to each other. Sensor ranging energy should be low to prolong system lifetime, but sufficiently high to fulfill prescribed accuracy requirements. This motivates us to investigate ranging energy optimization problems. We address ranging energy optimization for an unsynchronized positioning system, which features robust sensor positioning (RSP) in the sense that a specific accuracy requirement is fulfilled within a prescribed service area. We assume a line-of-sight (LOS) channel exists between the sensor and each beacon. The positioning is implemented by time-of-arrival (TOA) based two-way ranging between a sensor and beacons, followed by a location estimation at a central processing unit. To establish a dependency between positioning accuracy and ranging energy, we assume the adopted TOA and location estimators are unbiased and attain the associated Cramer-Rao bound. The accuracy requirement has the same form as the one defined by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), and we present two constraints with linear-matrix-inequality form for the RSP. Ranging energy optimization problems, as well as a practical algorithm based on semidefinite programming are proposed. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated by numerical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2028211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05170094.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2028211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","startPage":"4777","endPage":"4787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ranging Energy Optimization for Robust Sensor Positioning Based on Semidefinite Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5170094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ranging Energy Optimization for Robust Sensor Positioning Based on Semidefinite Programming","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977246","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5170094/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ranging Energy Optimization for Robust Sensor Positioning Based on Semidefinite Programming","sourcePdf":"tsp-leus-2028211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117664S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5170094","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5170095,"authors":[{"name":"Huang-Jen Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5379132/5170095/5170095-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huang-Jen Chiu (M'00\u2013SM'09) was born in I-Lan, Taiwan, in 1971.

While many different approaches to the problem are possible, one major effect of clock frequency difference between nodes, environmental temperature changes, has often been left out of the solution. The common assumption that the temperature is static over a certain period of time is often used as an excuse to assume constant frequency errors in a clock. This assumption forces synchronization protocols to resynchronize too often. While there exists hardware solutions to this problem, their prohibitive high cost and power consumption make them unsuitable for some applications, such as wireless sensor networks. Temperature compensated time synchronization (TCTS) exploits the on-board temperature sensor existing in many sensor network platforms. It uses this temperature sensor to autonomously calibrate the local oscillator and removes effects of environmental temperature changes. This allows a time synchronization protocol to increase its resynchronization period, without loosing synchronization accuracy, and thus saves energy and communication overhead. In addition, TCTS provides a stable clock source when radio communication is impaired. We present the theory behind TCTS, and provide initial results of a simulated comparison of TCTS and the flooding time synchronization protocol.","doi":"10.1109/LES.2009.2028103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LES.2009.2028103","startPage":"37","endPage":"41","publicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Embedded Systems Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563995/5339269/05170185.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5339269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature Compensated Time Synchronization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Temperature Compensated Time Synchronization","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10980268","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5170185/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature Compensated Time Synchronization","sourcePdf":"les-tschmid-2028103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088208S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563995","isNumber":"5339269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563995","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5339269","articleId":"5170185","onlineDate":"21 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5170196,"authors":[{"name":"David Santos-Martin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5075737/5170196/5170196-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Santos-Martin received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the E.T.S.

DFIG is the most employed WECS, and the DPPC+ guarantees their operation under unbalance conditions achieving the required objectives. Although the technique can be implemented to control both rotor and grid converters, we hereby expound the former, which regulates stator active and reactive power. The validation of the results obtained with DPPC+ has been performed through the use of experimental tests on a 20-kW test bench, consisting of a DFIG and induction motor drive. The obtained results show that the DPPC+ is suitable for achieving a good dynamic response while controlling current distortion and power and/or torque oscillations for both steady-state conditions and unbalanced voltage dips, showing the low-voltage ride-through capability.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5075737/05170196.pdf","startPage":"1747","endPage":"1757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2016965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2016965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5170196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing Ride-Through Capability to a Doubly Fed Induction Generator Under Unbalanced Voltage Dips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Induction generators","Voltage fluctuations","Voltage control","Dynamic programming","Wind energy","Testing","Power control","Rotors","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","dynamic programming","dynamic response","induction motor drives","machine control","power convertors","power grids","power supply quality","reactive power control","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly fed induction generator","voltage dips","machine control strategy","dynamic programming power control plus","wind energy","electrical grid","wind energy conversion system","rotor control","grid converter control","stator active regulation","reactive power regulation","induction motor drive","dynamic response","current distortion control","steady-state conditions","torque oscillation","power 20 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)","dynamic programming power control plus (DPPC$+$)","unbalanced voltage","voltage dip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Providing Ride-Through Capability to a Doubly Fed Induction Generator Under Unbalanced Voltage Dips","volume":"24","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5170196/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10799082","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing Ride-Through Capability to a Doubly Fed Induction Generator Under Unbalanced Voltage Dips","sourcePdf":"tpel-santos-martin-2016965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088301S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5075737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5075737","articleId":"5170196","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5170197,"authors":[{"name":"Makoto Hagiwara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5075737/5170197/5170197-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Makoto Hagiwara (M'06) was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1979.

The MMC is based on cascade connection of multiple bidirectional chopper-cells per leg, thus requiring voltage-balancing control of the multiple floating DC capacitors. However, no paper has made an explicit discussion on voltage-balancing control with theoretical and experimental verifications. This paper deals with two types of pulsewidth-modulated modular multilevel converters (PWM- MMCs) with focus on their circuit configurations and voltage-balancing control. Combination of averaging and balancing controls enables the PWM-MMCs to achieve voltage balancing without any external circuit. The viability of the PWM-MMCs, as well as the effectiveness of the voltage-balancing control, is confirmed by simulation and experiment.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2014236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5075737/05170197.pdf","startPage":"1737","endPage":"1746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5075737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2014236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control and Experiment of Pulsewidth-Modulated Modular Multilevel Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5170197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Control and Experiment of Pulsewidth-Modulated Modular Multilevel Converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170197/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10799083","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5170197/","volume":"24","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control and Experiment of Pulsewidth-Modulated Modular Multilevel Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-hagiwara-2014236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083339S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5075737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"1161","xplore-issue":"5075737","articleId":"5170197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5170205,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Secondini","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant''Anna di Studi Universitari e di Perfezionamento, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/5170205/5170205-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Secondini was born in Rome, Italy, in 1975.

Even after linearization, it retains the contribution of the quadratic perturbation terms of the NLSE, thereby achieving higher accuracy than an RP with comparable complexity. We revise parametric gain and nonlinear phase-noise effects under the new theory.

to control the mover of a permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) servo drive to track periodic reference trajectories. First, the dynamic model of the PMLSM drive system is derived. Next, a recurrent FL-based FNN controller is proposed in this study to control the PMLSM. Moreover, the online learning algorithms of the connective weights, means, and standard deviations of the recurrent FL-based FNN are derived using the back-propagation (BP) method. However, divergence or degenerated responses will result from the inappropriate selection of large or small learning rates. Therefore, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is adopted to adapt the learning rates of the recurrent FL-based FNN online. Finally, the control performance of the proposed recurrent FL-based FNN controller with IPSO is verified by some simulated and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2017530","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5170206/05170216.pdf","startPage":"3151","endPage":"3165","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2017530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Functional-Link-Based Fuzzy Neural Network Controller With Improved Particle Swarm Optimization for a Linear Synchronous Motor Drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Functional-Link-Based Fuzzy Neural Network Controller With Improved Particle Swarm Optimization for a Linear Synchronous Motor Drive","volume":"45","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10792775","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent Functional-Link-Based Fuzzy Neural Network Controller With Improved Particle Swarm Optimization for a Linear Synchronous Motor Drive","sourcePdf":"tmag-lin-2017530.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047603S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","isNumber":"5170206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"36","articleId":"5170216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5170221,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Faiz","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Jawad Faiz (SM'94) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K., in 1988.","He is now a Professor and the Director of Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran.

We modeled the faults by using a modified winding function (MWF) and time-stepping finite-element (TSFE) methods to compute the stator currents of both healthy and faulty motors for processing. We then analyzed the stator signal spectra of the motors by the MWF and TSFE methods and estimated the amplitudes of sideband components attributable to the faults. The results obtained by TSFE agreed well with experimental measurements. However, there was considerable discrepancy between the MWF results and the experimental measurements. We investigated the reason for the discrepancy by analyzing the air gap magnetic field distribution in both healthy and faulty induction motors in order to determine their linear and actual magnetization characteristics. We found that, in a faulty motor, for fixed permeability, the analytic method yields a much larger magnetic flux amplitude than is actually the case. At the same time, the distribution of magnetic flux in the air gap is more asymmetric than the actual case. Here, we present our experimental results and those obtained with the MWF method, using the finite-element analysis package Opera2d 10.5, for two three-phase, four-pole, 60-Hz, 3-hp motors having 36 stator slots and 44 and 28 rotor slots, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2016416","startPage":"3137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5170206/05170221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2016416","endPage":"3144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Magnetic Saturation on Static and Mixed Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Magnetic Saturation on Static and Mixed Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motor","volume":"45","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5170221/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10792780","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Magnetic Saturation on Static and Mixed Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motor","sourcePdf":"tmag-faiz-2016416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068474S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5170206","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5170206","articleId":"5170221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5170225,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this technique, finite-element analysis (FEA) is used to find the heat-point spread function (heat PSF) of the IC chip. Then, the temperature map is used as input for an efficient image restoration algorithm which locates the sources of strong power dissipation non-uniformities. Therefore, it optimally solves the inverse heat transfer problem, and estimates the IC power map without extensive lab experiments. Our computationally efficient and robust method, unlike some previous techniques, applies to many experimental scenarios.

One of these promising memory concepts is called Resistive Switching Memory (ReRAM). Such memory is based on a switching mechanism controlled in current and/or voltage, between two distinct resistive states depending upon the material nature integrated in memory element. To lead such memory concept to a memory circuit or even, to a product, a big effort has to be done to forecast tools necessary to design and test this emerging memory. In this paper, a particular technology of ReRAM memories is introduced. First, an electrical model (ELDO-like) of a MIM-based (Metal/Insulator/Metal) ReRAM memory element is presented. Then, this model is used for the robustness assessment of ReRAM memory element in presence of actual defects inherent to CMOS process steps. Based on this electrical model, a big hurdle has been broken between material physics, design and test. Thus, new methods and solutions could be developed in the field of design and test for ReRAM memories.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5170460/","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10793722","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"25-29 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and Test Challenges in Resistive Switching RAM (ReRAM): An Electrical Model for Defect Injections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Test Challenges in Resistive Switching RAM (ReRAM): An Electrical Model for Defect Injections","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"3703a061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077571S","chronDate":"25-29 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5170437","isNumber":"5170438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5170437","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5170438","articleId":"5170460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5170462,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

Nowadays, the empirical know-how of the designer is still decisive for the process parameters. Itpsilas often requires very costly trial-and-error, and it is complicated and time-consuming. The paper presents a unique reverse engineering approach to the design of process parameters. It uses finite element simulation to obtain the data as the training samples of neural network, and artificial neural network for prediction the optimum process parameters. Instead of using the process parameters as input values and rolling outcomes as output values, the BPNN model configures the tube parameters as inputs and the process parameters as outputs. A group data of tube parameters are inputted to the trained neural network, and the optimum parameters are obtained in the output. In addition, an example of continuous tube rolling is included to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach to tube rolling.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and

The proposed algorithm makes use of the recommendation for image data compression from the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and specific residue image bit-plane compensation. Comparing with the recommendation for satellite image compression from CCSDS, the proposed algorithm can reconstruct near lossless images with less bit rate than the recommendation of CCSDS does. Benefited from run-length coding and specific residue image bit-plane compensation, the proposed algorithm can obtain higher quality satellite image at similar bit rate or lower bit rate at the similar image quality. These results are valuable for reducing transmission time of high quality satellite image data. This work can be further improved by combining other binary compression techniques and the extension of this work may offer a VLSI or a DSP implementation of the proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we present a distributed tracking approach based on Bayesian framework to avoid huge computational expenses involved in sampling from a joint state space. Single-object trackers easily suffer from false identities of objects after severe occlusions because of hidden first-order Markov hypotheses. To solve the problem, we define a transition matrix between consecutive frames to denote the occurrences and probabilities of dynamic events, such as continuation, appearance, disappearance, interaction and split associating current object detections and previous tracking results. Analyzing transition probabilities combined with position, direction and appearance, we can infer depth ordering of occlusions.The transition matrix is able to effectively guide multiple single-object particle filters to predict and update the state of objects. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach can initialize automatically and track varying number of objects with occlusions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170764/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","volume":"6","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10794187","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5170764/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Multi-object Tracking Method Using Multiple Particle Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Multi-object Tracking Method Using Multiple Particle Filters","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3507f568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045934S","chronDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5170260","isNumber":"5170643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5170260","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5170643","articleId":"5170764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5170824,"authors":[{"name":"Zicheng Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Zicheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37857040300"},{"name":"Yukun Sun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Yukun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404478600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3507-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5170824","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuits","Active filters","Power engineering and energy","Fourier series","Computational modeling","Power system harmonics","Reactive power","Computer science","Power engineering computing","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","Fourier series","power filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reactive current real-time detection method","direct computation","active power filter","Fourier series expression","nonlinear load current"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active power filter (APF)","nonlinear load current","fundamental active current","fundamental reactive current","harmonic current","Fourier series","detection precision"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5170824","doi":"10.1109/CSIE.2009.249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSIE.2009.249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170782","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5170260/5170782/05170824.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fundamental Reactive Current Real-Time Detection Method Based on Direct Computation","abstract":"For active power filter (APF), the study on fundamental reactive current detection method is necessary and has important meaning. In this paper, according to the Fourier seriespsila expression of the nonlinear load current, the detection principle of the fundamental reactive current is proposed. In terms of this detection principle, a fundamental reactive current real-time detection method based on direct computation is put forward. This method has the traits of using formula to calculate directly, small computation quantity, the variation of the electrical source frequency having very small influence, etc. When the load current is placed in stable state, the method can accurately calculate out the fundamental reactive current. When the load current slowly varies, the method has preferable tracking capability. When the load current takes a step change, the method has biggish computation error. When the load current is placed in mutative state, the amplitude of fundamental reactive current calculated out by the method can smoothly slowly circuitously track the true amplitude of fundamental reactive current. The correctness of the method is verified by both simulation and experiment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5170824/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5170824/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10794235","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Fundamental Reactive Current Real-Time Detection Method Based on Direct Computation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fundamental Reactive Current Real-Time Detection Method Based on Direct Computation","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3507c172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039082S","chronDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5170260","isNumber":"5170782","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5170260","xplore-issue":"5170782","articleId":"5170824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5170838,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Yan","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yan","id":"37876057900"},{"name":"Xiang Peng","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Peng","id":"37880010400"},{"name":"Xiaxiang Lin","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaxiang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37875704000"},{"name":"Wei Jiang","firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37670850100"},{"name":"Tian Liu","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37880972200"},{"name":"Hong Guo","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37276730700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3507-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5170838","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Error analysis","Cryptographic protocols","Computer science","Laboratories","Communication system software","Quantum computing","Information analysis","Error correction codes","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","quantum cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["winnow protocol","secret key reconciliation","quantum key distribution","optimal block size"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Winnow","Information Reconciliation","Quantum Key Distribution"]}],"abstract":"Secret key reconciliation is an important step in the process of quantum key distribution.

Previous attack graph generation methods are generally not suitable for large network, because of their high complexity of time, high consumption of space, and the large scale of attack graphs. Based on substantive analysis of the vulnerabilities in network, this paper describes a model for automatically generating and analyzing network attack graph. Besides, a prototype system bases on this model has been designed.

On the basis of study the existing type of PAPR reduction algorithm applying the highly complex calculation probability, this paper proposes an algorithm of partial transmit sequence with the multi-antenna cooperative working by proving the strict corresponding conjugated relationships between weight vectors on the double antennas in the partial transmit sequence algorithm. This algorithm applies the partial transmit sequence algorithm to the OFDM system which uses space-time block coding. The simulation results show the improved algorithm can effectively reduce the PAPR and the calculation, it has great practical values.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction Improved Algorithm for MIMO-OFDM System","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CSIE.2009.71","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5170260/5171115/05171156.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSIE.2009.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Research of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction Improved Algorithm for MIMO-OFDM System","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5171156/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10799488","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research of Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction Improved Algorithm for MIMO-OFDM System","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3507a171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079655S","chronDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5170260","isNumber":"5171115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5170260","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5171115","articleId":"5171156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5171157,"authors":[{"name":"Li Yicai","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","School of Information Science and Engineering, Chongqing Jiaotong University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yicai","id":"37991309500"},{"name":"Yang Shizhong","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Shizhong","id":"37991547200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3507-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5171157","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":196},"abstract":"OFDM-based system is a strong candidate for future wireless communication. One major disadvantage of OFDM is the high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPR). This paper concentrates on the PAPR reduction and proposes an effective method. In the method, the transmitted sequence in frequency domain is separated into two sequences and are implemented IFFT respectively, and one of the two sequences is cyclic shifted, and then they are added together. The OFDM symbol with minimum PAPR is transmitted. After FFT in receiver, the data only needs to be multiplied with a simple revising matrix. Simulations and computational complexity analysis show that the proposed method compared with SLM and PTS can reduce the PAPR significantly, and has lower computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5170260/5171115/05171157.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CSIE.2009.325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSIE.2009.325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Effective Low-Complexity Method for PAPR Reduction in OFDM-Based Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","OFDM","Computational complexity","Educational institutions","Power engineering and energy","Wireless communication","Computational modeling","Transmitters","Signal mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fast Fourier transforms","frequency-domain analysis","matrix algebra","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity method","PAPR reduction","OFDM-based systems","wireless communication","peak-to-average power ratio","frequency domain","IFFT algorithm","matrix revision","computational complexity analysis","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","inverse fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PAPR reduction","cyclic shift"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Effective Low-Complexity Method for PAPR Reduction in OFDM-Based Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5171157/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10799489","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Effective Low-Complexity Method for PAPR Reduction in OFDM-Based Systems","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3507a176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044618S","chronDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5170260","isNumber":"5171115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5170260","xplore-issue":"5171115","articleId":"5171157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5171158,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Wu","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37293503000"},{"name":"Wen Chen","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"38007150000"},{"name":"Wu-Jun Xu","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wu-Jun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37065129600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3507-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5171158","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency estimation","Intersymbol interference","Delay estimation","Least squares approximation","Computational complexity","Computer science","Educational institutions","Information science","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency estimation","least squares approximations","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NLS carrier frequency offset estimator","OFDM systems","nonlinear least square estimation scheme","fine estimation","coarse estimations","training symbol","computational complexity","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["frequency offset estimation","OFDM","identical parts","nonlinear least square"]}],"abstract":"A simplified nonlinear least square (NLS) carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation scheme is proposed based on an OFDM training symbol with L identical parts. Since the NLS CFO estimate scheme has no close-solution, the estimate process is divided into two steps of fine and coarse estimations. The fine estimation is obtained by the correlation of two identical halves in the training symbol. After compensating the fine estimation, the coarse estimation is easily obtained based on NLS by searching the peak on the L-point frequency grids.Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity of coarse CFO estimation, a strategy of adaptive adjusting the number of used sub-symbols based on estimate reliability evaluation is devised. Computer simulations demonstrate that the proposed CFO estimator has a satisfying estimate performance, while maintaining a low computer complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CSIE.2009.451","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5170260/5171115/05171158.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSIE.2009.451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simplified NLS Frequency Offset\u00a0\u00a0Estimator for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171158/","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified NLS Frequency Offset\u00a0\u00a0Estimator for OFDM Systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10799490","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171158/","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplified NLS Frequency Offset\u00a0\u00a0Estimator for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3507a181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068803S","chronDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5170260","isNumber":"5171115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5170260","xplore-issue":"5171115","articleId":"5171158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5171163,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihua Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37406263500"},{"name":"Zongjue Qian","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zongjue","lastName":"Qian","id":"37402896200"},{"name":"Guochu Shou","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guochu","lastName":"Shou","id":"37396578900"},{"name":"Yihong Hu","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yihong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37403245800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3507-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5171163","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelength division multiplexing","Chebyshev approximation","Chaos","Spread spectrum communication","Passive optical networks","Optical fiber networks","Multiaccess communication","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","code division multiple access","optical fibre networks","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OCDMA system","WDM system","Chebyshev-map chaotic spread spectrum","passive optical network","optical code division multiple access","wavelength division multiplexing","bit error rate performance","multiaccess interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical code division multiple access","wavelength division multiplexing","passive optical network","Chebyshev-map","chaotic spread spectrum"]}],"abstract":"We propose optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) over wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in passive optical network (PON) based on Chebyshev-map chaotic spread spectrum.

This paper presents a study of heating effects resulted from using a mobile phone operating near a metal wall. The unsplit-field finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation scheme was used in the simulation. The simulated physical domain consists of a dipole antenna, a high-resolution human head model and a metal wall enclosed by the perfectly matched layer (PML). In this case, the PML acts as an electromagnetic field absorbing layer and was backed by a perfect electric conductor. An antenna operated at 900 MHz and 1.8 GHz was used in the simulation. The specific absorption rate (SAR) was computed and averaged on a tissue mass of one gram and ten grams, SAR 1-g and SAR 10-g, respectively. The main purpose of the present research is to compare SAR resulted from a mobile phone operated at two different frequencies (900 MHz and 1.8 GHz) in the close proximity to a metal wall. Also, average powers(P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">avg</sub>\n) absorbed in various human tissues were computed with a distance between an antenna and a metal wall ( Deltal ) as a varied parameter. Results from the simulation show that the computed SAR 1-g and SAR 10-g values are not exceed the limitation values established by various standard institutes. Also, the average power absorbed in all tissue models with a mobile phone operated at 1.8 GHz has an average power lower than those operated at 900 MHz except for the average power absorbed in muscle (7<Deltal<9 cm) and (7<Deltal<11 cm).","doi":"10.1109/CSIE.2009.707","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Computer Science and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5170260/5171115/05171193.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSIE.2009.707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsplit-Field FDTD Simulation of a Mobile Phone Operating Near a Metal Wall","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171193/","displayDocTitle":"Unsplit-Field FDTD Simulation of a Mobile Phone Operating Near a Metal Wall","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10799525","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171193/","conferenceDate":"31 March-2 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsplit-Field FDTD Simulation of a Mobile Phone Operating Near a Metal Wall","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3507a364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055101S","chronDate":"March 31 2009-April 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5170260","isNumber":"5171115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5170260","xplore-issue":"5171115","articleId":"5171193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5171212,"authors":[{"name":"Olusegun O.

It conditionally cuts the paths with little energy within the window, then decreases the infection caused by noise. The proposed channel tracking algorithm aimed at the considerable performance damage coursed by frequency offset conquers the sparseness of pilots, tracks and corrects the amplitude attenuation and phase rotation coursed by frequency offset.

Computational numerical simulations for the suppression capacity of the considered schemes, used the adaptive algorithm supervised recursive least squares to adjust the weight coefficients of the array are considered. This real scheme of dipole antennas when compared with ideal scheme of isotropic antennas it presented sufficiently reasonable approaches being therefore recommended for applications in real system cellular mobile communications.

Most of these works (generally having constraints on the array configuration) take for granted several assumptions, among which one can highlight considering isotropic sources and not taking into account coupling between array elements. Great advances have been achieved in the field of computational electromagnetics which allow complex radiating structures, including finite antenna arrays, to be analyzed from a full-wave approach inherently taking into account all electromagnetic effects. Recently, new techniques for the afore-mentioned pattern synthesis problems with the inclusion of this rigourous electromagentic (EM) analysis have been developed. In this work, the authors propose an EM-based design technique which yields the excitations of an arbitraty planar array to output a field pattern with minimum maximum sidelobe level (SLL) given the directions of various main beams with specified mainlobe widths and different relative amplitudes and phase differences. The array is characterized through a generalized scattering matrix (GSM) and its radiated field is expressed as a spherical mode expansion (SME). The accurate determination of the array GSM is needed to have it rigourously characterized, so the use of a full-wave technique is required in case complex antenna elements or arbitrary array configurations are considered. We develop the formulation to arrive at a standard linear programming (LP) problem. Numerical results of a linear array of dielectric resonator antennas (DRA's) are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171513.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multibeam synthesis with minimum SLL through linear programming from the GSM-analysis of an array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Antenna arrays","Linear antenna arrays","Dielectric resonator antennas","Electromagnetic analysis","GSM","Design optimization","Computational electromagnetics","Electromagnetic fields","Electromagnetic radiation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","dielectric resonator antennas","electromagnetic waves","linear programming","multibeam antennas","S-matrix theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibeam synthesis","linear programming","optimization","array pattern synthesis","computational electromagnetics","complex radiating structures","electromagentic analysis","minimum maximum sidelobe level","generalized scattering matrix","GSM","spherical mode expansion","SME","dielectric resonator antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multibeam synthesis with minimum SLL through linear programming from the GSM-analysis of an array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171513/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10800621","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multibeam synthesis with minimum SLL through linear programming from the GSM-analysis of an array","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"IF218p1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035428S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5171517,"authors":[{"name":"Sembiam R.

In this class of problems, there exists an ideal set of solutions, named the Pareto front, over which no other solution of the population dominates. Multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOAs) performs similarly to conventional genetic algorithms except that, rather than providing only a single optimal solution, the MOAs lead toward the determination of a Pareto front. This set presents a range of solutions for which no one can simultaneously satisfy the required performance but represents a tradeoff of the design requirements. Our aim is to develop a tool for the synthesis of array working at multiple frequencies within a large frequency band, with constraints imposed to the radiation pattern in terms of half-power beam width (HPBW) and side lobe level (SLL). More in detail, we are interested in developing an efficient code for more than two objectives. Therefore a particular version of multi-objective genetic algorithm, called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) has been implemented to optimize the array factor on the horizontal plane of a V-shaped array at three different frequencies.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a global stochastic optimization technique in which the parameter space of the function to be optimized is spanned by particles whose behavior simulates that of a swarm. In the standard PSO the position of each particle is used to compute the value of the function to be optimized. Individual particles are then attracted, stochastically, by both their best past positions and by the global best position of the whole swarm.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171519","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171519.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Meta-PSO techniques for multi-objective optimization of non-uniform planar arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planar arrays","Cost function","Particle swarm optimization","Optimization methods","Electrochemical machining","Evolutionary computation","Stochastic processes","Computational modeling","Design optimization","Employment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic waves","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","planar antenna arrays","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["meta particle swarm optimization","Meta-PSO","multiobjective optimization","nonuniform planar arrays","evolutionary algorithms","electromagnetic structures","global stochastic optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Meta-PSO techniques for multi-objective optimization of non-uniform planar arrays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171519/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10800627","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Meta-PSO techniques for multi-objective optimization of non-uniform planar arrays","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"IF218p8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069508S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5171527,"authors":[{"name":"Yuehe Ge","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Macquarie University Sydney, Sydney, Australia"],"lastName":"Yuehe Ge","id":"37277134700"},{"name":"Karu P.

This technique is expected to be employed in handheld devices as high bit rate intensive applications become more popular, such as internet access, high definition signal transmission or on-line gaming. However, a major challenge for integrating a multiple-antenna system in a handheld device is the arrangement of the antennas, as they cannot be placed anywhere without considering the coupling effect between elements. However the volume of the handheld is strictly limited and therefore fundamental limits restrict what operating configurations of bandwidth, frequency and number of ports that can be achieved. One way forward is to consider reconfigurable antennas that can reuse the existing volume and electronically reconfigure the multi-element antennas to different frequency bands and various multi-port antennas at different times. This paper presents two implementations which can reconfigure the multi-port antennas to operate in lower frequency bands. The first approach uses an additional slot on the ground plane to allow reconfiguration and the second approach is by connecting two short radiating elements together to form a longer current path.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171557","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171557.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171557","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable multi-port antennas for handheld devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable multi-port antennas for handheld devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171557/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171557/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10800665","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable multi-port antennas for handheld devices","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"IF317p9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033693S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5171561,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Y.

Since surface basis functions are not supported in the framework of VGFEM, volumetric vector basis functions are forced to impose boundary conditions at the aperture. This is achieved by constructing conformal PU domains from the geometry mesh. The method has been validated by comparing the simulated radar cross sections of filled cavities against measurement and FEM-BI data. Our current research is on the application of the method for large scattering and radiation problems using tailored basis functions, and these results will be presented at the conference.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171717","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171717.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vector generalized finite element-Boundary Integral formulation for scattering from cavity-backed apertures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171717/","displayDocTitle":"A vector generalized finite element-Boundary Integral formulation for scattering from cavity-backed apertures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10800825","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171717/","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vector generalized finite element-Boundary Integral formulation for scattering from cavity-backed apertures","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s125p8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033389S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5171720,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The amplitudes of a linear phased array antenna are optimized to reduce the interference in multi-beam satellite communication systems by implementing the optimization algorithm and the antenna pattern calculations on a single FPGA. The ant colony optimization algorithm, which is a bio-inspired heuristic search method based on the survival skills of ants, is applied to a phased array antenna such that nulls can be placed in the array factor to reduce interference from beams operating at the same frequency band. Due to the inherently parallel nature of the algorithm, speed improvements in the orders of ten thousands compared to conventional programming using Matlab have been demonstrated by being able to pipeline and parallelize the calculations on the FPGA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field programmable gate array acceleration of bio-inspired optimization techniques for phased array design","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171725","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171725.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Field programmable gate array acceleration of bio-inspired optimization techniques for phased array design","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171725/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10800833","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field programmable gate array acceleration of bio-inspired optimization techniques for phased array design","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s126p6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034328S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5171726,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Rossi","affiliation":["Computational Electromagnetics Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37684882700"},{"name":"Poman P.M.

The FPAs are comprised of many electrically small (< 0.5lambda) elements that can be used to generate multiple closely overlapping beams on the sky. As a result, both the size and continuity of the telescope's Field Of View (FOV) can be substantially improved with respect to conventional reflector systems fed by single-horn or cluster feeds in a one-horn-per-beam configuration. The size of the FOV, in combination with the system sensitivity and instantaneous bandwidth, constitutes an important figure of merit, that is, FOV x BandWidth x Sensitivity, and is proportional to the survey speed of a telescope which should be maximized. One example of such a design, based on this new technology, is APERTIF (van Cappellen and Bakker, 2009), which aims at increasing the survey speed of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) with a factor of ~20.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171751","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171751.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-axis beam performance of Focal Plane Arrays for the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope - Initial results of a prototype system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Off-axis beam performance of Focal Plane Arrays for the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope - Initial results of a prototype system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10800859","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5171751/","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Off-axis beam performance of Focal Plane Arrays for the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope - Initial results of a prototype system","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s129p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039725S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5171752,"authors":[{"name":"W.A. van Cappellen","affiliation":["Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON), Dwingeloo, Netherlands"],"firstName":"W.A.","lastName":"van Cappellen","id":"37300092100"},{"name":"L.

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems are one such technology that can increase data rates, provide robustness and reduce interference. However, mutual coupling issues can arise from having multiple antennas in compact and mobile MIMO devices. For reduced mutual coupling, antennas are typically spaced at a minimum of lambda/2 apart . If a separator such as a standard metal sheet is placed in between two antennas to reduce coupling, each must be at least lambda/4 away from the screen for proper operation. However, from image theory it is known that antennas can efficiently work in close proximity (less than lambda/4) when placed over a magnetically conducting surface. A new design technique is introduced here for creating thin, double-sided artificial magnetic conductor screens for isolation of two closely placed antennas. Doubly periodic thin surfaces with electrically small unit cells are designed and optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA). A practical example using closely spaced monopole antennas is created and verified using Ansoft HFSStrade.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171816","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171816.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite planar double-sided AMC surfaces for MIMO applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171816/","displayDocTitle":"Composite planar double-sided AMC surfaces for MIMO applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10800924","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171816/","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite planar double-sided AMC surfaces for MIMO applications","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s208p1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044211S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5171817,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-Chun Pu","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ta-Chun","lastName":"Pu","id":"37695879000"},{"name":"Chun-Yi Wu","affiliation":["Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Chun-Yi","lastName":"Wu","id":"38004454600"},{"name":"Hung-Hsuan Lin","affiliation":["Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Hung-Hsuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37537497800"},{"name":"Jui-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, TW"],"firstName":"Jui-Hung","lastName":"Chen","id":"38009198800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3647-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"5171817","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Slot antennas","WiMAX","MIMO","Antenna measurements","Bandwidth","Antenna accessories","Isolation technology","Space technology","Gain measurement","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","slot antennas","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-shielding open slot antenna","WiMAX MIMO application","metal component","internal antenna position"]}],"abstract":"A self-shielding open slot antenna has been proposed, constructed and tested.

Firstly, one single antenna has been effectively designed by HFSS software. Since it is very difficult to optimize the MIMO antenna parameters using HFSS, the single antenna has been modeled by a magnetic current to be used in optimization procedure. The magnetic current distribution can be employed in reciprocity approach along with MoM analysis to calculate the field radiation pattern of antenna element in presence of practical ground plane. This approach provides a calculation method, which is very suitable for optimization purposes. The optimization has been performed on correlation coefficient between antenna elements to obtain the optimum physical parameters. Ultimately, the optimal design has been validated by HFSS simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO antenna design and optimization for mobile applications","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171822","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171822.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"MIMO antenna design and optimization for mobile applications","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171822/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10800930","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO antenna design and optimization for mobile applications","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s208p8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063602S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5171823,"authors":[{"name":"Sanguk Park","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sanguk","lastName":"Park","id":"38009516900"},{"name":"Jungyup Lee","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jungyup Lee","id":"38008705600"},{"name":"Joonghee Lee","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joonghee Lee","id":"37065090000"},{"name":"Austin S.

Most notably, the 2CMPM improved the standard deviation of the prediction by 8 Mbps in the 5.2 GHz band. Further, analysis of the data shows that in LOS environments 802.11n systems will begin to see significant decreases in MIMO performance as the LOS distance from the transmitter to the receiver increases beyond approximately 15 m at 2.4 GHz and approximately 7 m at 5.2 GHz. These results show that the performance of MIMO systems can be characterized and planned without the need for overly complicated spatio-temporal modeling techniques. The 2CMPM can provide network planners with a prediction of bit rate coverage without having to resort to time-consuming and difficult simulation techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving practical MIMO network planning using the Two-Curve MIMO Performance Model","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171831","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171831.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Achieving practical MIMO network planning using the Two-Curve MIMO Performance Model","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171831/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10800939","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving practical MIMO network planning using the Two-Curve MIMO Performance Model","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s210p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046168S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5171851,"authors":[{"name":"Yazhou Wang","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Yazhou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407576800"},{"name":"Yunqiang Yang","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Yunqiang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406580200"},{"name":"Aly E.

Plasma effects contributed by electrons, positive, and negative ions are considered in this model. The current density vectors are collocated at the positions of the electric field vectors, and the complete FDTD algorithm consists of three regular updating equations for the magnetic field intensity components, as well as 12 tightly coupled differential equations for updating the electric field components and current densities. This model has the capability to simulate wave behavior in cold plasma for an applied magnetic field with arbitrary direction and magnitude. The FDTD algorithm is validated by calculating the Faraday rotation of a linearly polarized plane wave, which demonstrates very good agreement with the analytical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new 3-D FDTD model of magnetized cold plasma for modeling electromagnetic wave propagation in the earth-ionosphere waveguide","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5171916","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05171916.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5171916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5171916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5171916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new 3-D FDTD model of magnetized cold plasma for modeling electromagnetic wave propagation in the earth-ionosphere waveguide","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5171916/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10801024","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new 3-D FDTD model of magnetized cold plasma for modeling electromagnetic wave propagation in the earth-ionosphere waveguide","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s230p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037774S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5171916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5171943,"authors":[{"name":"Trang Thai","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Trang","lastName":"Thai","id":"37545551800"},{"name":"Justin Ratner","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Ratner","id":"37295838900"},{"name":"Wenhua Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave Digital Communication, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279187600"},{"name":"Tushar Thrivikraman","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Tushar","lastName":"Thrivikraman","id":"37400798200"},{"name":"Gerald DeJean","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, US"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"DeJean","id":"37280227900"},{"name":"Manos Tentzeris","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Manos","lastName":"Tentzeris","id":"37280293200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3647-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"5171943","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Nanomaterials","Textiles","Impedance","Carbon nanotubes","Optical resonators","Scattering parameters","Frequency","Yarn","Insertion loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","microwave antennas","millimetre wave antennas","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrathin polarized nanomaterials","millimeter-wave textile antenna applications","impedance analysis","wideband applications","polarization detection","sensing applications","CNT","resonators","wireless gas sensor designs","microwave frequency range","frequency 26.5 GHz to 40 GHz"]}],"abstract":"A novel PNM textile with extremely small thickness on the order of a few micron was characterized at millimeter wave frequencies (26.5 - 40 GHz), and the impedance analysis of the material was presented.

The measured EF-IBC channel shows a bandpass profile with a center frequency around 42 MHz. The channel bandpass profile is mainly determined by the capacitive parasitic return path and the capacitive PCB leakage path. Below 100 MHz, the body appears to be a uniform attenuator with about 15 dB loss at the distance of 15 cm between TX and RX. The channel characteristics are recombined by all the components, and match well with the direct measurement results, which verifies the decomposition method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05172001.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5172001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5172001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization and analysis of intra-body communication channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication channels","Electrodes","Electromagnetic waveguides","Impedance matching","Attenuation","Grounding","Equivalent circuits","Copper","Data engineering","Heat engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intra-body communication channel","electric field-intrabody communication","channel bandpass profile","capacitive parasitic return path","capacitive PCB leakage path","body area network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Characterization and analysis of intra-body communication channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172001/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10801109","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization and analysis of intra-body communication channel","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s309p9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037167S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5172001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5172006,"authors":[{"name":"Chan Chen","affiliation":["Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Chan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37311052900"},{"name":"Michael A.

The presentation includes a proposed algorithm for generating uncorrelated keys despite the fact that the random numbers generated by the propagation channel exhibit spatial and temporal correlation. It further briefly discusses some of the measures that must be taken to make the algorithm implementation practical as well as the theoretically-achievable performance of the algorithm. Simulation results using a physical path-based time-variant MIMO model demonstrate that the length of the established key grows as antennas are added.

It enables an outstanding polarization decoupling over the very wide frequency range. The antenna built accordingly to this concept can be realized in the planar technology, where the radiation occurs perpendicularly to the antenna surface. This feature is not common in the few dual-polarized ultra wideband antennas introduced in the literature. The concept assures that the phase center of radiation is the same for both polarizations and does not move at all in the whole frequency range. This is very advantageous especially for the impulse-based UWB systems. The coupling between ports is very low. The measurements with the antenna basing on this concept confirm the theoretical assumptions and show very good performance of the device.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Antenna feeds","Polarization","Ultra wideband antennas","Bandwidth","Antenna radiation patterns","Ultra wideband technology","Frequency","Dielectrics","Vivaldi antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","planar antennas","polarisation","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential feeding","broadband dual-polarized antennas","dual-orthogonal polarization","linear polarization","planar technology","dual-polarized ultra wideband antennas","radiation","impulse-based UWB systems"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5172047","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05172047.pdf","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5172047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential feeding as a concept for the realization of broadband dual-polarized antennas with very high polarization purity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Differential feeding as a concept for the realization of broadband dual-polarized antennas with very high polarization purity","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10801155","publicationDate":"June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5172047/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential feeding as a concept for the realization of broadband dual-polarized antennas with very high polarization purity","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s323p2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050169S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5172047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5172048,"authors":[{"name":"Haeil Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Sungdong-Gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Haeil","lastName":"Chung","id":"38006707300"},{"name":"Yohan Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Sungdong-Gu, Seoul, Korea"],"lastName":"Yohan Jang","id":"37291202900"},{"name":"Jaehoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Sungdong-Gu, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37280083300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3647-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"5172048","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile antennas","MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Antenna measurements","Frequency","Wireless LAN","Bandwidth","Gain measurement","Current distribution","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","mobile radio","monopole antennas","multifrequency antennas","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband internal antenna design","mobile application","WiBro-WLAN-M-WiMax","WCDMA service","MIMO antenna","folded monopole antenna","antenna feeding port"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a multiband internal antenna for mobile application","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5172048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05172048.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5172048","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172048","abstract":"In this paper, a multi-band internal antenna for WiBro/WLAN/M-WiMAX (2.3 GHz ~ 2.69 GHz) and WCDMA services is proposed.

For airborne radar systems, space-time adaptive processing (STAP) is the approach that is normally adopted to detect ground moving targets in ground clutter, but the technique becomes less effective if the speed of ground moving targets is very low because of the proximity of the Doppler frequency of targets to that of ground clutter. Typical low-speed ground target detection scenarios include detecting ground troops and slowly-moving ground vehicles. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar possesses multiple transmitting and receiving channels providing additional diversified reflections for fusion processing in target detection and measurements. MIMO radar has been extensively investigated, but the exact structure of MIMO radar is defined widely different. In this work, an innovative multi-level MIMO radar signal processing architecture is proposed for airborne systems to effectively detect low-speed ground moving targets. The new MIMO-based approach is demonstrated to be effective for detecting such low-speed ground targets in this work, and some simulation results are presented subsequently.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05172132.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5172132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5172132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of low-speed ground moving targets using MIMO radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","MIMO","Doppler radar","Clutter","Object detection","Airborne radar","Adaptive systems","Frequency","Vehicle detection","Land vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","Doppler radar","MIMO communication","radar antennas","radar clutter","radar signal processing","radar tracking","receiving antennas","space-time adaptive processing","target tracking","telecommunication channels","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-speed ground moving target detection","MIMO radar","airborne radar system","STAP","space-time adaptive processing","ground clutter","Doppler frequency","multiple transmitting channel","multiple receiving channel","radar signal processing architecture","radar antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detection of low-speed ground moving targets using MIMO radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172132/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10801240","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of low-speed ground moving targets using MIMO radar","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s404p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059661S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5172132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5172135,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper, the authors demonstrate the split-field periodic FDTD method where convolutional PML (CMPL) has been employed to improve the deficiencies in the previous methods..","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05172210.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5172210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5172210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of a second order CPML absorbing boundary condition within the periodic FDTD method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boundary conditions","Finite difference methods","Periodic structures","Electromagnetic compatibility","Photonics","Frequency domain analysis","Time domain analysis","Electric breakdown","Perfectly matched layers","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absorbing media","convolution","electromagnetic wave absorption","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","inhomogeneous media","periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perfectly matched layer","second order CPML absorbing boundary","periodic structures","split field periodic FDTD method","convolutional PML"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effectiveness of a second order CPML absorbing boundary condition within the periodic FDTD method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172210/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10801318","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effectiveness of a second order CPML absorbing boundary condition within the periodic FDTD method","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s424p9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050094S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5172210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5172239,"authors":[{"name":"R.

WLAN technology is now becoming a viable alternative to traditional wired solutions even in the office environments. Moreover, the access point (AP) equipped with multiple-input-multiple-out (MIMO) antenna arrays have received great interest for high data rate transmission. Nevertheless, the deployment of APs in this scenario may be quite dense as the system will be capacity limited. Consequently, the links may be relatively short, so that there may frequently be a strong LoS component. In this case the angle spread would be very low, and MIMO may not work very well. Therefore, accurate channel model for MIMO enabled WLAN is of great significance from system level to evaluate an indoor deployment of IEEE 802.11n APs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05172255.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5172255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5172255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray-tracing based channel model for 5GHz WLAN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Wireless LAN","MIMO","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Floors","Building materials","Bandwidth","Noise figure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","indoor radio","MIMO communication","ray tracing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray-tracing based channel model","WLAN","wireless local area network","access point","multiple-input-multiple-out antenna arrays","high data rate transmission","indoor deployment","frequency 5 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Ray-tracing based channel model for 5GHz WLAN","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172255/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10801363","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray-tracing based channel model for 5GHz WLAN","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s430p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036622S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5172255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5172258,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew C.

Vertically-aligned transmitters are found to have better SIR performance - 9% of the sectors in the aligned configuration and 23% in the staggered configuration have SIRs less than 5 dB. The central services core significantly reduces the SIR, however this effect can be alleiviated by including another set of vertically-aligned transmitters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling interference for indoor wireless systems using the FDTD method","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2009.5172258","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5154401/5171433/05172258.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2009.5172258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5171433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modelling interference for indoor wireless systems using the FDTD method","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172258/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10801366","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling interference for indoor wireless systems using the FDTD method","confLoc":"North Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"s430p6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03825S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5154401","isNumber":"5171433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5154401","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5171433","articleId":"5172258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5172268,"authors":[{"name":"Sinan Keser","affiliation":["The Edward S.

This problem is important in measurement setups. Undesired interactions affect antenna input impedance and/or radiation pattern, possibly invalidating lengthy measurements (not to mention poor performance upon device deployment). This work addresses the issue of removing these unwanted effects from measured data (typically in near field), so that one synthetically regains the desired reference conditions (e.g. free-space operation) in the processed data.

Without energy, a sensor is essentially useless and cannot contribute to the utility of the network as a whole. Consequently, substantial research efforts have been spent on designing energy-efficient networking protocols to maximize the lifetime of WSNs. However, there are emerging WSN applications where sensors are required to operate for much longer durations (like years or even decades) after they are deployed. Examples include in-situ environmental/habitat monitoring and structural health monitoring of critical infrastructures and buildings, where batteries are hard (or impossible) to replace/recharge. Lately, an alternative to powering WSNs is being actively studied, which is to convert the ambient energy from the environment into electricity to power the sensor nodes. While renewable energy technology is not new (e.g., solar and wind) the systems in use are far too large for WSNs. Those small enough for use in wireless sensors are most likely able to provide only enough energy to power sensors sporadically and not continuously. Sensor nodes need to exploit the sporadic availability of energy to quickly sense and transmit the data. This paper surveys related research and discusses the challenges of designing networking protocols for such WSNs powered by ambient energy harvesting.","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172411","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172411.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless sensor networks powered by ambient energy harvesting (WSN-HEAP) - Survey and challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172411/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless sensor networks powered by ambient energy harvesting (WSN-HEAP) - Survey and challenges","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800263","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172411/","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless sensor networks powered by ambient energy harvesting (WSN-HEAP) - Survey and challenges","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"7226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080585S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"209","articleId":"5172411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5172412,"authors":[{"name":"Joaquin Recas Piorno","affiliation":["DACYA, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"Recas Piorno","id":"37322339200"},{"name":"Carlo Bergonzini","affiliation":["DEIS, Universit degli Studi di Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Bergonzini","id":"37993199700"},{"name":"David Atienza","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Atienza","id":"37275656500"},{"name":"Tajana Simunic Rosing","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Tajana","lastName":"Simunic Rosing","id":"37295875800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172412","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1763},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy management","Wireless sensor networks","Prediction algorithms","Solar energy","Batteries","Sensor systems","Weather forecasting","Energy storage","Capacitors","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","patient monitoring","solar power","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor nodes","solar panels","energy harvesting","solar prediction algorithm","weather-conditioned moving average","exponential weighted moving average","energy management algorithm","Shimmer node","structural health monitoring"]}],"abstract":"Solar panels are frequently used in wireless sensor nodes because they can theoretically provide quite a bit of harvested energy.

In particular, WCMA is able to effectively take into account both the current and past-days weather conditions, obtaining a relative mean error of only 10%.

A long-term monitoring facilitates the capturing of sporadic events and therefore is an important contribution for the improvement of the therapy and, consequently, for the health of the patients. The task has been accomplished by Bluetooth technology, ECG detector and personal computer as monitor.","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172426","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172426.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless ECG monitoring system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless ECG monitoring system","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172426/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800278","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5172426/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless ECG monitoring system","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"6563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066543S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5172439,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Ranvier","affiliation":["SMARAD, Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Ranvier","id":"37270539900"},{"name":"Suiyan Geng","affiliation":["SMARAD, Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Suiyan","lastName":"Geng","id":"37430133700"},{"name":"Pertti Vainikainen","affiliation":["SMARAD, Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Pertti","lastName":"Vainikainen","id":"37280837800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172439","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mobile communication","Antenna measurements","Wavelength measurement","Mutual information","Rayleigh channels","Computer vision","Performance evaluation","Bandwidth","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","mobile radio","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mm wave MIMO systems","high-data rate mobile communications","mutual information","Rayleigh channel","antenna selection","switching networks","multigigabit communications","multiple-input multiple-output systems","frequency 60 GHz","distance 10 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimeter-wave measurement","multiple input multiple output (MIMO) measurement","mutual information","antenna selection"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the performance of 60 GHz MIMO system is analyzed based on experimental data. The mutual information (MI) of the measured channel is compared to the MI of an iid MIMO Rayleigh channel. It is seen that the mean MI of the channels are quite close to each other. Then, the MI of the MIMO system is compared to the one of a MIMO system with antenna selection. It is found that, when considering switching networks with realistic losses, the performance decreases drastically and, in most cases, MIMO antenna selection leads to lower MI than traditional MIMO with the same number of RF chains. Finally, the achievable data-rate of a realistic 4 times 4 MIMO system is calculated, based on the experimental data. It is shown that with 500 MHz bandwidth such a system can provide multigigabit communications at distance up to 10 m.","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172439","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172439.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mm-wave MIMO systems for high data-rate mobile communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172439/","displayDocTitle":"Mm-wave MIMO systems for high data-rate mobile communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800291","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172439/","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mm-wave MIMO systems for high data-rate mobile communications","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"0143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078994S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5172440,"authors":[{"name":"Preben E.

The DC offset is modeled as a zero mean complex Gaussian distributed random variable. By this modeling of the DC offset, the analytical expression for degraded bit error rate has been derived. To derive this analytical expression, some approximation has been made. The good agreement between the analytical and simulation results shows that proper approximation has been made and confirms the accuracy of the analytical expressions. Moreover, an approach to compensate the DC offset in these systems is introduced.

The proposed method exploits self-interference cancellation to effectively reduce a variety of interferences; and thus, it can overcome not only frequency-selectivity caused by multipath reception but also time-selectivity caused by mobility; in particular, OFDM communications are often expected to operate in the presence of both wide Doppler spread and long delay spread. As a result, the proposed technique can achieve lower channel estimation errors and lower bit error probabilities than the conventional techniques exploiting a time-averaging method. Since sufficiently long PRP sequences have never been found in the previous works regarding PRP-OFDM, an application of the proposed technique using chirp signals for mobile PRP-OFDM communication is investigated because the chirp signals exhibit good training properties.","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172454","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172454.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","startPage":"222","endPage":"226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LS channel estimation assisted from chirp sequences in OFDM communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LS channel estimation assisted from chirp sequences in OFDM communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172454/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800306","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5172454/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LS channel estimation assisted from chirp sequences in OFDM communications","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"7653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05011S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5172456,"authors":[{"name":"Simona V.

Generally, V-BLAST system is combined with OFDM, so the undergoing channel is flat. But the channel of TDD-CDMA is always frequency selective. Therefore, when the V-BLAST detection algorithms are applied into TDD-CDMA, the algorithms need to be modified. The proposed symbol by symbol scheme can apply the V-BLAST algorithms, which are MMSE-SIC (Minimum Mean Square Error-Successive Interference cancellation) and MMSE-QRD (Minimum Mean Square Error-QR Decomposition) in this paper, into TDD-CDMA. The experiment of paper which compares the symbol by symbol scheme of MMSE-BDFE (minimum mean square error-block decision feedback equalization), MMSE-SIC and MMSE-QRD shows that MMSE-SIC has better performance than the others, and MMSE-BDFE and MMSE-QRD have the similar performance. MMSE-SIC has highest complexity and MMSE-QRD has lowest complexity. The proposed algorithms can be applied in the MIMO receiver of HSDPA+ in TD-SCDMA.","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172457","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172457.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying V-BLAST detection algorithms into TDD-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172457/","displayDocTitle":"Applying V-BLAST detection algorithms into TDD-CDMA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800309","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172457/","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying V-BLAST detection algorithms into TDD-CDMA","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"6083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03904S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5172476,"authors":[{"name":"Mingwei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Mingwei Wu","id":"37087989401"},{"name":"Pooi Yuen Kam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pooi Yuen","lastName":"Kam","id":"37280044700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172476","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172476","abstract":"A maximum-likelihood sequence detector with no explicit extraction of channel state information (MLSD-NCSI) for diversity reception of quadrature-amplitude-modulated (QAM) signals over a flat fading channel is derived.

with reduced feedback and mode adaptation. In this strategy both base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) are equipped with multiple antennas. Threshold scheme is employed. Only eligible MS whose channel quality exceeds a preset threshold would select transmission mode, including beamforming (BF) and spatial multiplexing (SM) and adaptively feed back channel information. With feedback information, BS schedules one user out of candidate MSs at each time slot. In evaluating the scheme, statistical analysis is employed in company with Monte-Carlo simulation. Results show that with appropriate thresholds and mode adaptation, the proposed scheme can achieve high capacity as well as low feedback load and outage probability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic transmission in MU-MIMO downlink with reduced feedback and mode adaptation","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172478","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172478.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic transmission in MU-MIMO downlink with reduced feedback and mode adaptation","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172478/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800330","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic transmission in MU-MIMO downlink with reduced feedback and mode adaptation","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"2535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089576S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5172482,"authors":[{"name":"Chulhee Jang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chulhee Jang","id":"37087650686"},{"name":"Jae Hong Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Hong Lee","id":"37087178376"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172482","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Multiaccess communication","Multiuser detection","Detection algorithms","Multiple access interference","Intersymbol interference","MIMO","Diversity methods","Fading","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","multi-access systems","multiuser detection","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IDMA system","interleave-division multiple access system","relays","chip-by-chip detection algorithm","multiuser detection","mobile radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IDMA system","Relay","Cooperative diversity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172482","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a IDMA system with relays.

Even though cognitive radio technology is commonly related to public safety communications from the aspect of interoperability; awareness, learning, and intelligence features of cognitive radios can be beneficial for victim and first responder location estimation. Location and environment based services of cognitive radio technology can be employed to detect and locate victims even for cases in which the original core wireless communications network is down. In this paper, a location awareness approach for public safety communications is proposed. Location sensing method proposed detects wireless signals with the aid of noise floor estimation procedure and calculates their strengths in a given frequency spectrum. Simulation results indicate that less than 5% detection error rates can be achieved even for very low signal power levels which are the common cases for most uplink cellular signals in extreme cases.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","startPage":"520","endPage":"524","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172499.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RSS-based location awareness for public safety cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5172499/","displayDocTitle":"RSS-based location awareness for public safety cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800351","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RSS-based location awareness for public safety cognitive radio","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"6911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041781S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5172520,"authors":[{"name":"Eugene Golovins","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa"],"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Golovins","id":"37403639700"},{"name":"Neco Ventura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa"],"firstName":"Neco","lastName":"Ventura","id":"37297116200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172520","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Recursive estimation","OFDM","MIMO","Frequency estimation","Transceivers","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","channel estimation","communication complexity","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","statistical analysis","transforms","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust recursive two-dimensional channel estimator","MIMO-OFDM system","wireless doubly-selective channel","pilot-assisted transmission","channel state information","two-dimensional filtering algorithm","channel statistics","operation mode restriction","transform-domain processing","adaptive filtering module","communication complexity","robust estimator architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output","multipath","mean square error","forgetting factor"]}],"abstract":"MIMO-OFDM systems operating in the wireless doubly-selective channels rely on the pilot-assisted transmissions to acquire channel state information. Application of the two-dimensional filtering algorithms to channel estimation in the MIMO configurations is challenging due to the complexity considerations. Furthermore, different pilot structures employed in different spatial links necessitate development of scalable and reconfigurable estimator structures. The estimation scheme should also be robust to the changes in channel statistics and operation mode restrictions. To address these problems, robust estimator architecture is presented, which is based on the transform-domain processing and separable adaptive filtering modules.","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172520","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172520.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","startPage":"630","endPage":"638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust recursive two-dimensional channel estimators for the MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust recursive two-dimensional channel estimators for the MIMO-OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172520/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800372","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5172520/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust recursive two-dimensional channel estimators for the MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"1798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057463S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5172523,"authors":[{"name":"Tore Ulversoy","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","UNIK-University Graduate Center, Kjeller, Norway","Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt (FFI), Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Tore","lastName":"Ulversoy","id":"37403115700"},{"name":"Torleiv Maseng","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","UNIK-University Graduate Center, Kjeller, Norway","Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt (FFI), Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Torleiv","lastName":"Maseng","id":"37350038100"},{"name":"Jorn Karstad","affiliation":["Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt (FFI), Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Jorn","lastName":"Karstad","id":"38243217800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172523","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Chromium","Permission","Vehicle dynamics","Radio transmitters","Frequency measurement","Time measurement","Mobile communication","Data communication","Unmanned aerial vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","numerical analysis","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sharing","dynamic spectrum access systems","autonomous architectural model","distributed architectural model","centralized architectural model","information theoretic n-link interference model","global optimum power density assignment","competitive optimum power density assignment","numerical example"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172523","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172523","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","abstract":"As an introduction, different dynamic spectrum access architectural concepts are reviewed and three idealized simplifications described: The autonomous, distributed and centralized architectural model. Based on an information-theoretic n-link interference model the global optimum (GO) and competitive optimum (CO) (selfish) power density assignment is discussed. A detailed case study is conducted for a numerical example with 2 links and 2 spectrum segments, comparing the GO and CO solutions, for a low interference, high interference and unsymmetrical interference deployment. It is shown that for conflicting links, with high symmetrical or unsymmetrical interference, the CO solution may become significantly worse than the GO one.

SCSF eliminates medium access control (MAC) and all data communication between sensors. In SCSF, a beacon is sent by the airborne collector through a directive antenna, and the illuminated sensors respond by simultaneously transmitting frequency modulated signals. The superposition of the sensor transmissions resembles a Doppler spectrum. The airborne collector (fusion center) applies a blind frequency estimator to the received superimposed signals for fusing the data. Estimation performance is evaluated in terms of the inverse normalized mean square error (INMSE) and is analyzed in terms of various system parameters such as sensor density, degree of correlation and modulation index. The analysis shows that the SCSF scheme performs well relative to a conventional fusion scheme that uses sample mean estimator for data fusion while not using MAC.","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172539","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172539.pdf","startPage":"732","endPage":"736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Cooperative Spectrum Fusion (SCSF) for aerial reading of a correlated sensor field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Cooperative Spectrum Fusion (SCSF) for aerial reading of a correlated sensor field","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800391","htmlLink":"/document/5172539/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Cooperative Spectrum Fusion (SCSF) for aerial reading of a correlated sensor field","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"5987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045992S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5172541,"authors":[{"name":"V.S.

The proposed design is fully programmable and can be reconfigured for a different LDPC code by changing the initialization of the control memory. Thus the architecture can be used for a multi-standard decoder which supports decoding of any structured or unstructured LDPC code. Furthermore, the parallelism of the architecture is unconstrained and fully scalable which allows to exchange hardware cost and throughput with fine granularity. In contrast to previously proposed programmable designs our approach uses parallel variable and check node processing and thus doubles the data throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully programmable decoder architecture for structured and unstructured LDPC codes","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172542","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172542.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fully programmable decoder architecture for structured and unstructured LDPC codes","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172542/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800394","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully programmable decoder architecture for structured and unstructured LDPC codes","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"1617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04505S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5172544,"authors":[{"name":"Debasish Bera","affiliation":["Wireless and Multimedia Innovation Laboratory, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Debasish","lastName":"Bera","id":"37089044811"},{"name":"Jaydip Sen","affiliation":["Wireless and Multimedia Innovation Laboratory, Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Jaydip","lastName":"Sen","id":"37296443700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172544","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Convolutional codes","Turbo codes","Bidirectional control","Bit error rate","Distortion","Attenuation","Fading","Convolution","Viterbi algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","computational complexity","convolutional codes","error statistics","turbo codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOVA-based decoding","double-binary turbo convolutional code","channel encoder","communication system","circular recursive systematic convolutional-based turbo codes","soft output viterbi algorithm","implementation complexity trade-off","classical binary turbo codes","error-correcting performance","bit error rate","prologue decoder","trellis decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CRSC","DVB-RCS","Prologue decoding","SOVA","Trellis","Turbo decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172544","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172544.pdf","startPage":"757","endPage":"761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOVA based decoding of double-binary turbo convolutional code","abstract":"The channel encoder is incorporated in communication system to mitigate the effects of distortion, attenuation and fading as may be experienced by the transmitted signal. In this article we have discussed about circular recursive systematic convolutional (CRSC) based turbo codes and their bi-directional soft output viterbi algorithm (SOVA) decoding approach. The bi-directional SOVA [10] is considered in view of its better performance and implementation complexity trade-off. Necessary changes in basic message passing equations of bi-directional SOVA has been introduced, when the double binary CRSC codes are considered instead of the classical binary turbo codes. Double binary CRSC code provides significant error-correcting performance while not suffering from the well-known bit error rate (BER) floor of classical binary turbo codes. Decoding of these circular codes requires a prologue decoder, prior to the actual trellis decoding, to estimate the initial state. A prologue-decoding algorithm for double-binary CRSC code has also been proposed. Prologue decoding plays a very important role in assessing the circulation state of the encoder for a CRSC codes [4]. Efficient determination of circulation state through prologue decoding helps in achieving impressive error performance. Insight into the process of prologue decoding is also useful in reducing average power dissipation in digital implementation of such turbo codecs. The design issues related to prologue decoding and their effects on error performance have also been discussed in this paper. It has been shown that, the performance of prologue decoder does not depend much on prologue length. Adequate simulation results have been included.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5172544/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800396","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SOVA based decoding of double-binary turbo convolutional code","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOVA based decoding of double-binary turbo convolutional code","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"6141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042518S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5172545,"authors":[{"name":"Satyabrata Rout","affiliation":["Essar Energy, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Satyabrata","lastName":"Rout","id":"38012483800"},{"name":"Adrish Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Adrish","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37274348500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172545","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172545","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Turbo codes","Relays","Decoding","AWGN","Fading","Parity check codes","Neodymium","Context modeling","Gaussian approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","convergence of numerical methods","decoding","interleaved codes","Rayleigh channels","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo code","half-duplex relay channel","decoder","interleaved Rayleigh fading channel","convergence analysis"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence analysis of turbo codes over half-duplex relay channel","startPage":"762","endPage":"766","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172545.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172545","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a design of turbo code with good convergence behavior for the half-duplex relay channel.

We implement the scheme using a compact two element ESPAR (electronically steerable parasitic array radiator) antenna with an inter-element spacing of lambda/16.

In multicarrier modulation scheme like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the pilot signal is dispersive over the frequency domain and the time domain and thus the estimated channel transfer function can trace the fluctuation of the actual one. This pilot signal is referred to scattered pilot. However, there has been no consideration about the scattered pilot for IFDMA. In this paper, we propose scattered pilot signal in IFDMA.

multiuser multi input multi output (MIMO) multicarrier (MC) DS CDMA system with co-channel interference mitigation technique is investigated. The future generation (4G) wireless networks aim at offering very high data rates and flexibility by supporting multiple users by adopting multicarrier (MC) transmissions. Multicarrier (MC) DS CDMA system possesses all these attributes and thus proves to be a promising air interface for 4G. In spite of these advantages MC DS CDMA system suffers from interferences which limits its capacity.

The performance of the improved MMSE IC and ML decoding for MC DS/CDMA system is envisaged. Improved MMSE interference cancellation (IC) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection for k - asynchronous users is employed at the receiver. The MMSE estimation considered here is adaptive in nature. Simulation results divulge that MIMO MC DS CDMA system with Improved MMSE IC and ML decoding provides better interference suppression in a multiuser environment.","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172559","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172559.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","startPage":"842","endPage":"846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust space time co-channel interference mitigation and detection technique for Multiuser MIMO Multicarrier DS/CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A robust space time co-channel interference mitigation and detection technique for Multiuser MIMO Multicarrier DS/CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172559/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800411","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5172559/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust space time co-channel interference mitigation and detection technique for Multiuser MIMO Multicarrier DS/CDMA systems","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"5991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039856S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5172561,"authors":[{"name":"Olutayo Oyeyemi Oyerinde","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"],"firstName":"Olutayo Oyeyemi","lastName":"Oyerinde","id":"37391602000"},{"name":"Stanley Henry Mneney","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa"],"firstName":"Stanley Henry","lastName":"Mneney","id":"37408199900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4066-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4067-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172561","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Adaptive systems","Iterative algorithms","Fading","Iterative methods","Approximation algorithms","Quadrature phase shift keying","OFDM modulation","Robustness","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","transceivers","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft iterative decision directed channel estimation","OFDM systems","adaptive predictor","fast data projection method","variable step size normalized least mean square method","FDPM subspace tracking algorithm","projection approximation subspace tracking algorithm","computer simulations","fractional spaced channel impulse response model","OFDM transceiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive predictor","channel estimation","fading channel","iterative methods","OFDM system"]}],"abstract":"Soft iterative decision directed channel estimation (DDCE) employing fast data projection method (FDPM) subspace tracking algorithm and variable step size normalized least mean square-based predictor is proposed for OFDM system in this paper.

This design goal has been previously investigated with respect to frequency flat channels, which applies for instance to transmission on individual subcarriers of a multi-carrier system. We extend previous algorithmic solutions, which solve the underlying optimization problem with one transmit power constraint per user on each frequency flat channel to the case where one user's power can be distributed over multiple frequency flat channels. We then apply the concept to multi-carrier transmissions where, due to practical constraints on signalling overhead and complexity, transmit powers can only be optimized for clusters of subcarriers. By means of simulations we compare several approaches to define adequate channel state information per cluster of subcarriers for the computation of transmit powers.","doi":"10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172578","publicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 1st International Conference on Wireless Communication, Vehicular Technology, Information Theory and Aerospace & Electronic Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161964/5172390/05172578.pdf","startPage":"961","endPage":"966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIRELESSVITAE.2009.5172578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint power allocation and receive filtering for uplink MU-MIMO multi-carrier transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172578/","displayDocTitle":"Joint power allocation and receive filtering for uplink MU-MIMO multi-carrier transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10800430","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172578/","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint power allocation and receive filtering for uplink MU-MIMO multi-carrier transmission","confLoc":"Aalborg, Denmark","sourcePdf":"5654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061078S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161964","isNumber":"5172390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161964","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5172390","articleId":"5172578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5172593,"authors":[{"name":"Tie-sheng Fan","affiliation":["Inst. of Inf., Liaoning Univ., ShenYang, China"],"firstName":"Tie-sheng","lastName":"Fan","id":"37087733054"},{"name":"Jian-sheng Xue","affiliation":["Inst. of Inf., Liaoning Univ., ShenYang, China"],"firstName":"Jian-sheng","lastName":"Xue","id":"37087732832"},{"name":"Wei-hong Xuan","affiliation":["Inst. of Inf., Liaoning Univ., ShenYang, China"],"firstName":"Wei-hong","lastName":"Xuan","id":"37087731639"},{"name":"Da-peng Qu","affiliation":["Inst. of Inf., Liaoning Univ., ShenYang, China"],"firstName":"Da-peng","lastName":"Qu","id":"37087735240"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3514-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172593","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"abstract":"Employed the characteristic of OFDM in spectrum utilizing-rate highly, 8 bit depth gray scale image instead of simple binary image was embedded in gray carrier image.

However, it is reported that traditional GAs often suffers from the weaknesses of premature convergence as well as parameter and operator dependence. For this, in this paper it is proposed a modeling strategy by adaptive GA (AGA) for production reactive scheduling of manufacturing systems with shared resources and simultaneous use of machines and AGVs.

However, there are some problems with LDPC code because it requires a great deal of time and effort involving trial and error in order to generate LDPC codes. Accordingly, we have proposed a design system for LDPC codes that uses a general-purpose cluster system and a hardware accelerator. However, it is rather difficult to utilize use the design system in real-world applications because of problems in widely implementing the cluster system and the hardware accelerator. Thus, the present paper proposes a Web-based application of the LDPC codes design system in order to overcome these problems. The proposal application has three advantages (no need for development of a commercial system, accessibility to the system all over the world with a general Web-browser, and streamlining and sharing with a database implementation of the system), and effectively solves the problems of applying LDPC codes for practical use.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling Control & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5172579/5172580/05172698.pdf","startPage":"627","endPage":"632","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling Control & Automation","doi":"10.1109/CIMCA.2008.183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMCA.2008.183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"World-Wide Accessible LDPC Encoder/Decoder Generator Using Web-Based GUI and API","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Graphical user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","error correction codes","graphical user interfaces","Internet","online front-ends","parity check codes","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC encoder-decoder generator","LDPC code","low-density parity check code","Web-based GUI","Web-based API","error correcting code","hardware accelerator","cluster system","Web-browser"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","Ruby on Rails","GA","MPI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"World-Wide Accessible LDPC Encoder/Decoder Generator Using Web-Based GUI and API","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172698/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10793601","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"World-Wide Accessible LDPC Encoder/Decoder Generator Using Web-Based GUI and API","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"3514a627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049159S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5172579","isNumber":"5172580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5172579","xplore-issue":"5172580","articleId":"5172698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5172705,"authors":[{"name":"Suchira Chaigusin","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science, Edith Cowan University, Australia"],"firstName":"Suchira","lastName":"Chaigusin","id":"37872406200"},{"name":"Chaiyaporn Chirathamjaree","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science, Edith Cowan University, Australia"],"firstName":"Chaiyaporn","lastName":"Chirathamjaree","id":"37297764000"},{"name":"Judy Clayden","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Science, Edith Cowan University, Australia"],"firstName":"Judy","lastName":"Clayden","id":"37883936700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3514-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172705","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":755},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Stock markets","Economic forecasting","Predictive models","Information science","Backpropagation","Feedforward neural networks","Gold","Exchange rates","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","economic forecasting","feedforward neural nets","share prices","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","stock prices prediction","financial markets","feedforward backpropagation neural networks","Thai stock market","Dow Jones index","Nikkei index","Hang Seng index","gold prices","minimum loan rate","exchange rates","Thai Baht","US dollar","mean absolute percentage error","Stock Exchange of Thailand index prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forecasting","Neural Networks","Prediction","Stock Exchange of Thailand","Stock Markets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172705","abstract":"Prediction of stock prices is an issue of interest to financial markets. Many prediction techniques have been reported in stock forecasting. Neural networks are viewed as one of the more suitable techniques. In this study, an experiment on the forecasting of the stock exchange of Thailand (SET) was conducted by using feedforward backpropagation neural networks. In the experiment, many combinations of parameters were investigated to identify the right set of parameters for the neural network models in the forecasting of SET. Several global and local factors influencing the Thai stock market were used in developing the models, including the Dow Jones index, Nikkei index, Hang Seng index, gold prices, minimum loan rate (MLR), and the exchange rates of the Thai Baht and the US dollar. Two yearspsila historical data were used to train and test the models. Three suitable neural network models identified by this research are a three layer, a four layer and a five layer neural network.

They have to be able to cope in dynamic and uncertain electronic environments, especially when developing their pricing strategies. In such environments, prices are determined dynamically through a competitive bidding process depending on the market situation, competitor strategies and/or customer preferences. The ability to predict winning bidding prices is crucial. This paper introduces a number of neural-network-based models for performing time-series forecasts of customer offer prices which could result in winning orders in the context of supply chain management (SCM). Different data transformation and normalisation methods are explored in the models, as well as the impact of the number of historical data points included in time-series on the accuracy of the prediction. Experiments in the Trading Agent Competition SCM game show the potential of the proposed algorithms for predicting prices in competitive and dynamic environments.","doi":"10.1109/CIMCA.2008.92","startPage":"680","endPage":"685","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling Control & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5172579/5172580/05172707.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling Control & Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMCA.2008.92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deploying Neural-Network-Based Models for Dynamic Pricing in Supply Chain Management","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Supply chain management","Predictive models","Consumer electronics","Accuracy","Games","Context modeling","Economic forecasting","Prediction algorithms","Raw materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic commerce","neural nets","pricing","strategic planning","supply chain management","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural-network-based models","dynamic pricing","supply chain management","e-commerce","static business strategies","uncertain electronic environments","dynamic electronic environments","pricing strategies","competitive bidding process","competitor strategies","customer preferences","time-series forecasts","customer offer prices","data transformation methods","data normalisation methods","Trading Agent Competition SCM game"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Networks","Time-series","Prediction","Dynamic Pricing","Supply Chain Management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Deploying Neural-Network-Based Models for Dynamic Pricing in Supply Chain Management","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172707/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10793609","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deploying Neural-Network-Based Models for Dynamic Pricing in Supply Chain Management","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"3514a680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06634S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5172579","isNumber":"5172580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5172579","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5172580","articleId":"5172707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":5172717,"authors":[{"name":"Lifeng Ai","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Ai","id":"37647859900"},{"name":"Maolin Tang","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Maolin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37276097900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3514-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5172717","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":467},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Web services","Quality of service","Delay","Availability","Australia","Scalability","XML","Simple object access protocol","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","quality of service","software quality","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS-aware Web service composition","interservice dependencies","interservice conflicts","value-added Web service","quality of service attributes","composite Web service","penalty-based genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web service composition","QoS","genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIMCA.2008.104","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling Control & Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling Control & Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5172579/5172580/05172717.pdf","startPage":"738","endPage":"743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMCA.2008.104","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5172717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Penalty-Based Genetic Algorithm for QoS-Aware Web Service Composition with Inter-service Dependencies and Conflicts","abstract":"In Web service based systems, new value-added Web services can be constructed by integrating existing Web services. A Web service may have many implementations, which are functionally identical, but have different quality of service (QoS) attributes, such as response time, price, reputation, reliability, availability and so on. Thus, a significant research problem in Web service composition is how to select an implementation for each of the component Web services so that the overall QoS of the composite Web service is optimal. This is so called QoS-aware Web service composition problem. In some composite Web services there are some dependencies and conflicts between the Web service implementations. However, existing approaches cannot handle the constraints.

However, it is thought as a problem that the camera vibrates and the image shakes in the aerial photography by the RC helicopter. Therefore, the position of the camera is first controlled so that the camera may always move to the horizontal position in the ground.

The current research challenge is to design and realize radio systems that should be able to achieve a desired quality of service (QoS) in this coexisting environment. Currently transmission resources of hyperspace are not properly exploited. The cognitive radio (CR), which can adapt to the environmental changes by reconfiguring itself, can be used to implement intelligent radio systems to exploit the orthogonal nature of multiple dimensions of hyperspace to maintain the desired QoS in coexisting factory environments.

Measurements on spectrum use show that in some cases the lengths of the vacant periods in a given frequency band can be correlated, a feature commonly used semi-Markov ON/OFF-models cannot reproduce. In this paper we study the stochastic properties of a simple primary system activity model constructed by aggregating the realisations of several semi-Markov ON/OFF-models. We show that despite its simplicity, our model does result in the desired correlations provided heavy-tailed distributions are used for the period length distributions of the individual processes. We also study in detail the statistical behaviour of our model as parameters such as number of processes being aggregated and distributions of the period lengths are changed.

This partial reconfiguration will be executed on a Spartan 3 FPGA. The visualization will be done in the following way. Standard motes will be connected to the FPG. On the motes the algorithms will be executed in software. Switching between ECC with a long key, i.e. 571 bit and those with short key length, e.g. to a key length of 163 bit, has a remarkable effect on the execution time. En-/decrypting messages sent to and received from the motes at the FPGA will show that ECC implementation has been reconfigured according to the selected curve on the motes.","doi":"10.1109/SAHCNW.2009.5172959","publicationTitle":"2009 6th IEEE Annual Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th IEEE Annual Communications Society Conference on Sensor, Mesh and Ad Hoc Communications and Networks Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5172906/5172907/05172959.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5172907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAHCNW.2009.5172959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfiguring Crypto Hardware Accelerators on Wireless Sensor Nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5172959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reconfiguring Crypto Hardware Accelerators on Wireless Sensor Nodes","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5172959/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10793468","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfiguring Crypto Hardware Accelerators on Wireless Sensor Nodes","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"PID901989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045757S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5172906","isNumber":"5172907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5172906","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5172907","articleId":"5172959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5173036,"authors":[{"name":"Bruce Nordman","affiliation":["Energy Analysis Department, Environmental Energy Technologies Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Bruce Nordman is a staff research associate in the Energy Analysis Department, Environmental Energy Technologies Division, of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

The protocol comprises of a two-phase transmission. In the first phase, the primary transmitter transmits a primary signal to the primary receiver, which is also received at the secondary transmitter and receiver. The secondary transmitter amplifies the received primary signal and generates a linearly weighted combination of this signal and the secondary signal. The weight is a variable power allocation factor \u03b1 (0 \u2a7d \u03b1 \u2a7d 1). This composite signal is then broadcast in the second transmission phase. We analyze the achievable rates for the primary and secondary systems, and determine \u03b1 such that the rate of primary system with this spectrum sharing protocol is no worse than that in the absence of the secondary system. We show that the spectrum sharing protocol can improve the rate of primary system by an appropriate choice of \u03b1, while at the same time achieve secondary spectrum access.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sharing via controlled amplify-and-forward relaying","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2008.5173151","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674453/4699392/05173151.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2008.5173151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4699392","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sharing via controlled amplify-and-forward relaying","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173151/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum sharing via controlled amplify-and-forward relaying","confLoc":"Cannes, France","sourcePdf":"1569122335[1].pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067124S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674453","isNumber":"4699392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674453","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4699392","articleId":"5173151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5173152,"authors":[{"name":"Megumi Kaneko","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Megumi","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37400086400"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski","id":"37281987200"},{"name":"Kazunori Hayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37277906800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2643-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2644-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5173152","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"abstract":"We address the problem of radio resource allocation in the Downlink (DL) of a cellular system with multiple Relay Stations (RS), based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) transmission technology.

In this paper, we propose a method to increase spectral efficiency in such a wireless relay network by employing an interference cancellation technique. We focus on a typical scenario of relaying in a cellular system, where a mobile station (MS) requires the help of a relay station (RS) to communicate with the base station (BS). In such a case, interference cancellation can be used to achieve a small reuse distance of identical radio resource. We analyze a simple scenario with BS, single RS, and 2 MSs, and show that the proposed method has significant potential to enhance spectral efficiency in wireless relay networks.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2008.5173157","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2008.5173157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4699392","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674453/4699392/05173157.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Relays","Resource management","Power system relaying","Wireless communication","Base stations","Adaptive systems","Cities and towns","Mobile communication","Power control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectral efficiency enhancement with interference cancellation for wireless relay network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173157/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173157/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral efficiency enhancement with interference cancellation for wireless relay network","confLoc":"Cannes, France","sourcePdf":"1569124385[1].pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068122S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674453","isNumber":"4699392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674453","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4699392","articleId":"5173157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5173160,"authors":[{"name":"Fumie Ono","affiliation":["Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumie","lastName":"Ono","id":"37269248700"},{"name":"Kei Sakaguchi","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Sakaguchi","id":"37266412100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2643-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2644-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5173160","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space time codes","MIMO","Network coding","Bidirectional control","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Interchannel interference","Interference cancellation","Block codes","Numerical analysis"]}],"abstract":"Efficient bi-directional multi-hop wireless networks based on MIMO algorithm or network coding have been proposed in recent literatures. In this paper, a new technique named as MIMO network coding, that is a combination of network coding and MIMO algorithm, will be proposed. By using MIMO network coding, co-channel interference cancellation and efficient bi-directional transmission can be realized simultaneously with lower complexity in multi-hop networks. Moreover, Space Time Block Code (STBC) MIMO transmission is also introduced to achieve higher reliability in MIMO network coding. It is confirmed from numerical analysis that the MIMO network coding with STBC supplies higher capacity and reliability than that of conventional schemes.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2008.5173160","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 19th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4674453/4699392/05173160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2008.5173160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4699392","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space time coded MIMO network coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space time coded MIMO network coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173160/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173160/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space time coded MIMO network coding","confLoc":"Cannes, France","sourcePdf":"1569124941[1].pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086907S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4674453","isNumber":"4699392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4674453","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4699392","articleId":"5173160","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5173167,"authors":[{"name":"Fasih-ud-Din Farrukh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Swabi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Fasih-ud-Din","lastName":"Farrukh","id":"37937752000"},{"name":"Sobia Baig","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Swabi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sobia","lastName":"Baig","id":"37302055000"},{"name":"M.

To avoid inter-symbol interference (ISI) in OFDM by a time dispersive channel, a cyclic prefix (CP) is used which also reduces its spectral efficiency. wavelet packet transform (WPT) as a modulation scheme has been proposed for wireless communication. In this paper, WPT based OFDM is presented and proposed using minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer. Equalization is a major factor in wavelets. MMSE is proposed for wavelet based OFDM (WOFDM) based on WPT and compared with zero forcing equalizer (ZFE). The performance is measured for arbitrary magnitude finite impulse response (FIR) channels in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and impulse noise. Simulation results show a clear improvement in bit error rate (BER) for MMSE over ZFE equalization technique in the presence of noise.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165455/5173162/05173167.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Electrical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICEE.2009.5173167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEE.2009.5173167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE equalization for discrete wavelet packet based OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet packets","Additive white noise","OFDM modulation","Equalizers","AWGN","Gaussian noise","Bit error rate","Fourier transforms","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","equalisers","error statistics","impulse noise","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","wavelet transforms","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE equalization","discrete wavelet packet transform","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","modulation technique","wireless communication","minimum mean square error equalizer","finite impulse response","FIR channel","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","impulse noise","bit error rate","BER","inter-symbol interference","time dispersive channel","cyclic prefix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform","Minimum Mean Square Error","Cyclic Prefix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"MMSE equalization for discrete wavelet packet based OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173167/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10799881","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE equalization for discrete wavelet packet based OFDM","confLoc":"Lahore, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"CR_COM_009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06568S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5165455","isNumber":"5173162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5165455","xplore-issue":"5173162","articleId":"5173167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5173168,"authors":[{"name":"S.

By making use of in situ heated test structures, we are able to change the temperature quickly and reliably at any stage of the experiment while keeping the device bias conditions untouched. This tool enables us on the one hand (i) to bring identically processed devices to the same degradation level, by stressing them under the same bias and temperature conditions, and on the other hand (ii) to vary the temperature in a defined way during recovery. Additionally we also study the influence of gate bias switches at constant temperature. Out of those experiments we have discovered that recovery acceleration can be observed either by increasing the temperature or by switching the gate bias for a short period of time towards accumulation. Since Charge Pumping (CP) measurements before stress and after recovery indicate that interface states cannot be made responsible for this acceleration, we suggest the neutralization of NBTI induced positive oxide traps to be the dominant recovery mechanism. However, if this is the case, we have to consider inelastic phonon-assisted tunneling in order to explain the temperature acceleration at fixed gate bias.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5164157/5173200/05173216.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unambiguous identification of the NBTI recovery mechanism using ultra-fast temperature changes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Acceleration","Interface states","Stress","Temperature dependence","Negative bias temperature instability","Testing","Degradation","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","semiconductor device reliability","tunnelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["negative bias temperature instability","interface states","charge pumping","neutralization","positive oxide traps","inelastic phonon-assisted tunneling","gate bias","PMOS transistors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NBTI recovery","polyheater","interface states","oxide traps","charge pumping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Unambiguous identification of the NBTI recovery mechanism using ultra-fast temperature changes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173216/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10800072","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unambiguous identification of the NBTI recovery mechanism using ultra-fast temperature changes","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.174949S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164157","isNumber":"5173200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164157","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5173200","articleId":"5173216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5173219,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The purpose of this paper is to study the statistical and scaling behavior of the SR phenomenon in PCM devices, through experimental and modeling tools, allowing for long term, physics-based, reliability extrapolations in large-scaled PCM arrays.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173236","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173236","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5164157/5173200/05173236.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical and scaling behavior of structural relaxation effects in phase-change memory (PCM) devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Statistical and scaling behavior of structural relaxation effects in phase-change memory (PCM) devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10800092","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173236/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical and scaling behavior of structural relaxation effects in phase-change memory (PCM) devices","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2E1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164157","isNumber":"5173200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164157","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5173200","articleId":"5173236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5173237,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Simulations show the good features of the method which is a powerful tool for evaluating the impact of RTS on performance and reliability of electron devices. Its application to phase change memories will be discussed in order to successfully analyze a new RTS phenomenon observed in the SET state during cycling. The physical nature of the phenomenon has been related to the random presence of an extra parasitic crystal (PC) path in the active volume of the chalcogenide material. The large current densities flowing during the SET operations can induce the PC formation, whereas the high temperature and the short quench time of the RESET operation are able to revert the PC to the amorphous state. Finally, the analysis shows that PC are correlated with the anomalous tail of the RESET distribution.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173237","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5164157/5173200/05173237.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new automated methodology for random telegraph signal identification and characterization: a case study on phase change memory arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new automated methodology for random telegraph signal identification and characterization: a case study on phase change memory arrays","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10800093","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173237/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new automated methodology for random telegraph signal identification and characterization: a case study on phase change memory arrays","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2E2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058278S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164157","isNumber":"5173200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164157","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5173200","articleId":"5173237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5173238,"authors":[{"name":"Masayuki Terai","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Terai","id":"37285407000"},{"name":"Setsu Kotsuji","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Setsu","lastName":"Kotsuji","id":"37297615700"},{"name":"Hiromitsu Hada","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromitsu","lastName":"Hada","id":"37294548900"},{"name":"Noriyuki Iguchi","affiliation":["Nano Electronics Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriyuki","lastName":"Iguchi","id":"37385488900"},{"name":"Toshinari Ichihashi","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshinari","lastName":"Ichihashi","id":"37318118200"},{"name":"Shinji Fujieda","affiliation":["Device Platforms Research Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinji","lastName":"Fujieda","id":"37297617500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2888-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2889-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-7026"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1891"}],"articleNumber":"5173238","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":802},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of ReRAM-stack asymmetry on read disturb immunity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Oxidation","Electric resistance","Voltage","Laboratories","National electric code","Switches","X-ray imaging","Amorphous materials","Stacking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar integrated circuits","random-access storage","stoichiometry","switching circuits","tantalum compounds","titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ReRAM-stack asymmetry","read disturb immunity","bipolar switching property","stoichiometric stack","nonvolatile memories","resistance switching layer","Ta2O5","Ti2O5"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ReRAM","RRAM","1T1R","read disturb","resistive switch","Ta2O5","TiO2"]}],"abstract":"We investigated the effect of ReRAM-stack asymmetry on read disturb immunity.

Significant changes in process architecture and materials were introduced and careful integration and manufacturing innovations were needed to meet historical expectations for transistor, defect, and package reliability. Furthermore the stability of intrinsic and defect reliability performance needed to be demonstrated. Highly accelerated TDDB and bias temperature instability (BTI) tests were implemented to enable very high sampling rates, establishing stable transistor reliability in high manufacturing volumes. Integrated product defect reliability results are presented showing that the historical correlation to yield defect density for stable manufacturing processes is maintained on this generation into an even lower fail rate regime. Similarly, volume package reliability monitor data are shown validating thermo-mechanical stability of the 1st level Pb-free package interconnect.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173277","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5164157/5173200/05173277.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability for manufacturing on 45nm logic technology with high-k + metal gate transistors and Pb-free packaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173277","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173277/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability for manufacturing on 45nm logic technology with high-k + metal gate transistors and Pb-free packaging","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10800133","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173277/","conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability for manufacturing on 45nm logic technology with high-k + metal gate transistors and Pb-free packaging","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128389S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164157","isNumber":"5173200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164157","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5173200","articleId":"5173277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5173278,"authors":[{"name":"Izumi Hirano","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Izumi","lastName":"Hirano","id":"37264905200"},{"name":"Yasushi Nakasaki","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasushi","lastName":"Nakasaki","id":"37264977200"},{"name":"Shigeto Fukatsu","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeto","lastName":"Fukatsu","id":"37317284400"},{"name":"Akiko Masada","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Akiko","lastName":"Masada","id":"37995748700"},{"name":"Yuichiro Mitani","affiliation":["Advanced LSI Technology Laboratory, Corporate R&D Center, Toshiba Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuichiro","lastName":"Mitani","id":"37279797900"},{"name":"Masakazu Goto","affiliation":["Semiconductor Company, Toshiba Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Masakazu","lastName":"Goto","id":"37287740300"},{"name":"Koji Nagatomo","affiliation":["Semiconductor Company, Toshiba Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Nagatomo","id":"38012169200"},{"name":"Seiji Inumiya","affiliation":["Semiconductor Company, Toshiba Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Seiji","lastName":"Inumiya","id":"37264978000"},{"name":"Katsuyuki Sekine","affiliation":["Semiconductor Company, Toshiba Corporation, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuyuki","lastName":"Sekine","id":"37264902100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2888-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2889-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-7026"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1891"}],"articleNumber":"5173278","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173278","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Weibull distribution","High K dielectric materials","High-K gate dielectrics","Inorganic materials","Dielectric measurements","Stress measurement","Voltage","Dielectric materials","Dielectric breakdown"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field effect transistors","hafnium compounds","silicon compounds","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metal gate electrode","Weibull distribution","gate dielectrics","n-FETs","bipolar stress","HfSiON"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","high-k","HfSiON","Metal-gate","TDDB"]}],"abstract":"The slope parameter of Weibull plot of Tbd, beta, strongly depends on gate electrode material for metalgate/HfSiON gate stacks in n-FETs.

These analyses rely on a noise framework which involves charge exchange between the inversion layer and the bulk dielectric defects via elastic tunneling. In this study, we extracted the characteristic capture and emission time constants from RTN in highly scaled nMOSFETs and showed that they are inconsistent with the elastic tunneling picture dictated by the physical thickness of the gate dielectric (1.4 nm). Consequently, our results suggest that an alternative model is required and that a large body of the recent RTN and 1/f noise defect profiling literature very likely needs to be re-interpreted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10800139","htmlLink":"/document/5173283/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Random telegraph noise in highly scaled nMOSFETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random telegraph noise in highly scaled nMOSFETs","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089015S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164157","isNumber":"5173200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164157","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5173200","articleId":"5173283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5173285,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Large NMOS PBTI degradation and correlation to SILC increase on such gate stack is a result of large trap generations in the bulk-HK. This poses a long term reliability concern on product standby power and can limit the operating voltage if not suppressed. On an optimized HK+MG process, we demonstrate that SILC has been suppressed. The transistor level SILC data, model and product burn-in stress data support this. With optimized process, SILC has no impact on products made of 45 nm HK+MG transistors.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173303","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5164157/5173200/05173303.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of SILC and its end-of-life reliability assessment on 45NM high-K and metal-gate technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173303","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173303/","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of SILC and its end-of-life reliability assessment on 45NM high-K and metal-gate technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10800159","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173303/","conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of SILC and its end-of-life reliability assessment on 45NM high-K and metal-gate technology","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"5C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041917S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164157","isNumber":"5173200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164157","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5173200","articleId":"5173303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5173304,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The stress distribution in silicon and interconnect is affected by the via diameter and layout geometry. The TSV induced stress changes silicon mobility and ultimately alters device performance. The mobility and performance change differs in nand p- silicon and is a function of the distance to the TSV. In addition, the TSV induced stress acts on the barrier layer, the landing pad, the interconnects, and the dielectrics. The interactions with defects may lead to crack nucleation and growth, and compromise the structure reliability. Furthermore, the material choice that reduces silicon stress for less impact on performance may increase stresses in other regions where reliability is of concern. This paper studies these effects and their dependence on various integration configurations.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173329","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5164157/5173200/05173329.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2009.5173329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173200","startPage":"682","endPage":"687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performanace and reliability analysis of 3D-integration structures employing Through Silicon Via (TSV)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173329","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performanace and reliability analysis of 3D-integration structures employing Through Silicon Via (TSV)","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173329/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10800185","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173329/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performanace and reliability analysis of 3D-integration structures employing Through Silicon Via (TSV)","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"AP1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045851S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164157","isNumber":"5173200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164157","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5173200","articleId":"5173329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5173339,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this work, we provide insights into relative sensitivities of these phenomena on speed and stability of SRAM cells. Relative impact on access time, stability, and tolerability of one phenomenon over another has been studied for different application specific (high-performance or low-power) SRAM cells. We show that high-performance SRAM cells should have lower VT drift due to PBTI compared with dense cells to contain read stability and access time.

The experimental analysis revealed new interesting features of the erratic erase phenomenon. The overall erased threshold voltage distribution, including tail bits, can be modeled by taking into account the erratic erase behavior whose characteristics can easily be measured by common cycling experiments. The statistical model of the erased threshold voltage obtained in this way can then be used to perform statistical simulation of the bitline leakage current, thus providing a powerful tool in memory design and optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 April 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173375/","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10800231","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"26-30 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"A statistical model of erratic erase based on an automated random telegraph signal characterization technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A statistical model of erratic erase based on an automated random telegraph signal characterization technique","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"MY6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059469S","chronDate":"26-30 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164157","isNumber":"5173200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164157","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5173200","articleId":"5173375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5173377,"authors":[{"name":"Wook H.

We present a hybrid ring-shaped wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-time division multiplexing (TDM) passive optical network (PON) that is capable of providing bandwidth on demand at high bit rates in a transparent and dynamic manner. Our cost-efficient and scalable network architecture is based on integratable components such as a wavelength-agile optical networking unit and a microring-resonator-based remote node. An appropriately modified control layer is introduced to manage the network. We also discuss the implementation of optical codes instead of time slots to take the step toward optical code division multiplexing (OCDM) WDM PONs that relieve the network of strict time scheduling of traffic and ranging. Therefore, an additional reduction of complexity in network management, improvement of network scalability, and a guarantee of fully symmetric traffic are foreseen for every user. Finally, we show a scenario for smooth migration from existing PON solutions to our WDM-TDM PON architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173426/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10793100","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Bit-Rate Dynamically Reconfigurable WDM\u2013TDM Access Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Bit-Rate Dynamically Reconfigurable WDM\u2013TDM Access Network","sourcePdf":"A143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095246S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5173408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5173408","articleId":"5173426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5173433,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wei","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563700/5173408/5173433/5173433-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Wei (M'05, SM'09) received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2004.

While the port voltages of the lumped-network subsystem are determined by the finite-element and circuit subsystems, its port currents are treated as external current excitations for the finite-element and circuit subsystems. All the lumped-network port variables are then eliminated from the final expressions to form a global system for only the finite-element and circuit unknowns. The proposed algorithm further extends the capability of the existing field-circuit solver to model more complex and mixed-scale hybrid circuits, and the algorithm is validated and demonstrated through numerical examples.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporation of Multiport Lumped Networks Into the Hybrid Time-Domain Finite-Element Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025459","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5200722/05173475.pdf","startPage":"2030","endPage":"2037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200722","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173475/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Incorporation of Multiport Lumped Networks Into the Hybrid Time-Domain Finite-Element Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5173475/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816582","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporation of Multiport Lumped Networks Into the Hybrid Time-Domain Finite-Element Analysis","sourcePdf":"57tmtt08-jjin-2025459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058611S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5200722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5200722","articleId":"5173475","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173481,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Morris","affiliation":["Eaton Innovation Center, Eaton Corporation, Southfield, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/5191265/5173481/5173481-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Benjamin Morris received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2002 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering systems from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a Lead Engineer at the Eaton Innovation Center, Southfield, MI.

The first main result shows that when a periodic orbit of a system with impulse effects lies within a hybrid invariant manifold, there exist local coordinate transforms under which the Jacobian linearization of the Poincare return map has a block upper triangular structure. One diagonal block is the linearization of the system as restricted to the hybrid invariant manifold, also called the hybrid zero dynamics. The other is the product of two sensitivity matrices related to the transverse dynamics-one pertaining to the impact map and the other pertaining to the closed-loop vector field. When either of these sensitivity matrices is sufficiently close to zero, the stability of the return map is determined solely by the stability of the hybrid zero dynamics. The second main result of the paper details the construction of a hybrid invariant manifold, such as that required by the first main theorem. Forward invariance follows from the methods of Byrnes and Isidori, and impact invariance is achieved by a novel construction of impact-updated control parameters. In addition to providing impact invariance, the construction allows entries of the impact sensitivity matrix of the transverse dynamics to be made arbitrarily small. A simulation example is provided where stable walking is achieved in a 5-link biped with series compliant actuation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5191265/05173481.pdf","startPage":"1751","endPage":"1764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2024563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2009.2024563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191265","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Invariant Manifolds in Systems With Impulse Effects With Application to Periodic Locomotion in Bipedal Robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Orbits","Stability","Robot kinematics","Jacobian matrices","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Differential equations","Feedback","Orbital robotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","Jacobian matrices","legged locomotion","linearisation techniques","periodic control","Poincare invariance","sensitivity analysis","stability","zero assignment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid invariant manifold","impulse effects","periodic locomotion","bipedal robot","walking control","stabilization","periodic orbit","local coordinate transforms","Jacobian linearization","Poincare return map","hybrid zero dynamics","sensitivity matrix","impact map","closed-loop vector field","forward invariance","impact invariance","impact-updated control parameter","transverse dynamics","stable walking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bipedal robots","hybrid systems","underactuated systems","zero dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Invariant Manifolds in Systems With Impulse Effects With Application to Periodic Locomotion in Bipedal Robots","volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5173481/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10806022","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Invariant Manifolds in Systems With Impulse Effects With Application to Periodic Locomotion in Bipedal Robots","sourcePdf":"54tac08-bmorris-2024563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.270878S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5191265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"5191265","articleId":"5173481","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173488,"authors":[{"name":"Yunong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yunong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279965700"},{"name":"Ke Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Chen","id":"37577340000"},{"name":"Hong-Zhou Tan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Zhou","lastName":"Tan","id":"37278708200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"5173488","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":126,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":743},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Neural networks","Computer errors","Pervasive computing","Concurrent computing","Analytical models","Steady-state","Upper bound","Hopfield neural networks","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","gradient methods","Hopfield neural nets","mathematics computing","matrix inversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient neural network","online time-varying matrix inversion","steady-state error","Hopfield-type neural network","convergence rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Global exponential convergence rate","gradient neural networks","performance analysis","residual error bound","time-varying matrix inversion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173488","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2023779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","abstract":"This technical note presents theoretical analysis and simulation results on the performance of a classic gradient neural network (GNN), which was designed originally for constant matrix inversion but is now exploited for time-varying matrix inversion.

In other words, the steady-state error between the GNN solution and the theoretical/exact inverse does not vanish to zero. In this technical note, the upper bound of such an error is estimated firstly. The global exponential convergence rate is then analyzed for such a Hopfield-type neural network when approaching the bound error.

The basic modeling assumption is that the vehicle is pro-pulsed via a thrust force along a single body-fixed direction and that it has full torque actuation for attitude control (i.e., a typical actuation structure for aircrafts, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicles, submarines, etc.). Additional assumptions on the external forces applied to the vehicle are also introduced for the sake of control design and stability analyses. They are best satisfied for vehicles which are subjected to an external force field (e.g., gravity) and whose shape induces lift forces with limited amplitude, unlike airplanes but as in the case of many VTOL drones. The interactions of the vehicle with the surrounding fluid are often difficult to model precisely whereas they may significantly influence and perturb its motion. By using a standard Lyapunov-based approach, novel nonlinear feedback control laws are proposed to compensate for modeling errors and perform robustly against such perturbations. Simulation results illustrating these properties on a realistic model of a VTOL drone subjected to wind gusts are reported.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2024569","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5191265/05173496.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2009.2024569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"1837","endPage":"1853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Control Approach for Thrust-Propelled Underactuated Vehicles and its Application to VTOL Drones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Control Approach for Thrust-Propelled Underactuated Vehicles and its Application to VTOL Drones","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173496/","volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5173496/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10806017","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Control Approach for Thrust-Propelled Underactuated Vehicles and its Application to VTOL Drones","sourcePdf":"54tac08-csamson-2024569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12354S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5191265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"5191265","articleId":"5173496","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5173502,"authors":[{"name":"HyungTae Kim","affiliation":["Mechatronics Team Technology, Korea Institute of Industrial and Technology, Chungnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"HyungTae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37634725400"},{"name":"KangWon Lee","affiliation":["Mechatronics Team Technology, Korea Institute of Industrial and Technology, Chungnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"KangWon","lastName":"Lee","id":"38185597600"},{"name":"BongKeon Jeon","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"BongKeon","lastName":"Jeon","id":"38001983000"},{"name":"ChangSeop Song","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"ChangSeop","lastName":"Song","id":"37280298000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5955"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3783"}],"articleNumber":"5173502","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173502","abstract":"This paper proposes a wafer alignment method using a feedforward neural network (FNN).

The proposed method was applied to a wafer manufacturing machine and its alignment performance was compared with that of conventional methods. The alignment time was reduced by the FNN model which was especially efficient in the case of macroscopic alignment.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2009.2024243","startPage":"377","endPage":"382","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/5443442/05173502.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2009.2024243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quick Wafer Alignment Using Feedforward Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Kinematics","Algorithm design and analysis","Manufacturing automation","Matrices","Multiplexing","Semiconductor device modeling","Detectors","Machine vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","semiconductor device manufacture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quick wafer alignment","feedforward neural network","kinematic position","conventional alignment method","multiplexer","scaler","back-propagation","macroscopic alignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Auto loading","automatic alignment","dicing process","precise stage","semiconductor manufacturing automation","wafer mounting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Quick Wafer Alignment Using Feedforward Neural Networks","volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5173502/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208214","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quick Wafer Alignment Using Feedforward Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tase-kim-2024243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058588S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"5443442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5443442","articleId":"5173502","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5173504,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Cucinotta","affiliation":["Real-Time System Laboratory, Scuola Superiore Sant'' Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/5196841/5173504/5173504-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tommaso Cucinotta (M'08) graduated with a Degree in computer engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 2000, and received the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, in 2004.","He is Assistant Professor of Computer Engineering at the Real-Time Systems Laboratory (ReTiS), Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna.

Vias are modeled using an analytical formulation for the parallel-plate impedance and capacitive elements, whereas the trace-via transitions are described by modal decomposition. It is shown that the models can be applied to efficiently simulate a wide range of structures. Different scenarios are analyzed including thru-hole and buried vias, power vias, and coupled traces routed into different layers. By virtue of the modal decomposition, the proposed method is general enough to handle structures with mixed reference planes. For the first time, these models have been validated against full-wave methods and measurements up to 40 GHz. An improvement on the computation speed of at least two orders of magnitude has been observed with respect to full-wave simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5200722/05173506.pdf","startPage":"2072","endPage":"2083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physics-Based Via and Trace Models for Efficient Link Simulation on Multilayer Structures Up to 40 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173506/","displayDocTitle":"Physics-Based Via and Trace Models for Efficient Link Simulation on Multilayer Structures Up to 40 GHz","volume":"57","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816571","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173506/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physics-Based Via and Trace Models for Efficient Link Simulation on Multilayer Structures Up to 40 GHz","sourcePdf":"57tmtt08-rrimolo-donadio-2025470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103406S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5200722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"5200722","articleId":"5173506","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173511,"authors":[{"name":"Myunghyun Ha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/5286959/5173511/5173511-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Myunghyun Ha received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

In a fully digital coherent system, the electric fields at the input and the output of the channel are available to DSPs at the transmitter and the receiver, enabling the use of arbitrary impairment precompensation and postcompensation algorithms. Linear time-invariant (LTI) impairments such as chromatic dispersion and polarization-mode dispersion can be compensated by adaptive linear equalizers. Non-LTI impairments, such as laser phase noise and Kerr nonlinearity, can be compensated by channel inversion. All existing impairment compensation techniques ultimately approximate channel inversion for a subset of the channel effects. We provide a unified multiblock nonlinear model for the joint compensation of the impairments in fiber transmission. We show that commonly used techniques for overcoming different impairments, despite their different appearance, are often based on the same principles such as feedback and feedforward control, and time-versus-frequency-domain representations. We highlight equivalences between techniques, and show that the choice of algorithm depends on making tradeoffs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber Impairment Compensation Using Coherent Detection and Digital Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2028245","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5401119/05173514.pdf","startPage":"502","endPage":"519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2028245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401119","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173514/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fiber Impairment Compensation Using Coherent Detection and Digital Signal Processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5173514/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11137520","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber Impairment Compensation Using Coherent Detection and Digital Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"jlt-kahn-2028245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107309S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5401119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"5401119","articleId":"5173514","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173517,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Chi Lo","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chi","lastName":"Lo","id":"38000135700"},{"name":"Szu-Lin Su","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Szu-Lin","lastName":"Su","id":"37280943400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5173517","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173517","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Phase shift keying","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Phase detection","Iterative decoding","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Degradation","Computational modeling","Demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","differential phase shift keying","probability","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SISO","FB-MAP detection","turbo-coded DPSK systems","soft-input-soft-output","forward/backward MAP","computational complexity","performance degradation","bit error rate","a posteriori probability","multiple-symbol differential sphere decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential modulation","iterative detection and decoding","iterative processing","maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection"]}],"abstract":"For turbo-coded differential phase-shift-keying (DPSK) systems under correlated flat-fading channels, a serial iterative structure of soft-input-soft-output (SISO) forward/backward MAP (FB-MAP) detection and SISO decoder is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of MAP detection without performance degradation.

The resulting gradient-based algorithm shares a remarkable simplicity together with a proven global rate of convergence which is significantly better than currently known gradient projections-based methods.

When the goal is to detect whether or not a digital content has been tampered with in order to alter its semantics, the use of multimedia hashes turns out to be an effective solution to offer proof of legitimacy and to possibly identify the introduced tampering. We propose an image hashing algorithm based on compressive sensing principles, which solves both the authentication and the tampering identification problems. The original content producer generates a hash using a small bit budget by quantizing a limited number of random projections of the authentic image. The content user receives the (possibly altered) image and uses the hash to estimate the mean square error distortion between the original and the received image. In addition, if the introduced tampering is sparse in some orthonormal basis or redundant dictionary, an approximation is given in the pixel domain. We emphasize that the hash is universal, e.g., the same hash signature can be used to detect and identify different types of tampering. At the cost of additional complexity at the decoder, the proposed algorithm is robust to moderate content-preserving transformations including cropping, scaling, and rotation. In addition, in order to keep the size of the hash small, hash encoding/decoding takes advantage of distributed source codes.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2028251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5286712/05173520.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2028251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286712","startPage":"2491","endPage":"2504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hash-Based Identification of Sparse Image Tampering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hash-Based Identification of Sparse Image Tampering","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173520/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918100","pubMedId":"19635704","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173520/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hash-Based Identification of Sparse Image Tampering","sourcePdf":"18tip11-gvalenzise-2028251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139135S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5286712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5286712","articleId":"5173520","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173522,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Generally, the MRF/CRF model is learned independently of the inference algorithm that is used to obtain the final result. In this paper, we observe considerable gains in speed and accuracy by training the MRF/CRF model together with a fast and suboptimal inference algorithm. An active random field (ARF) is defined as a combination of a MRF/CRF based model and a fast inference algorithm for the MRF/CRF model. This combination is trained through an optimization of a loss function and a training set consisting of pairs of input images and desired outputs. We apply the ARF concept to image denoising, using the Fields of Experts MRF together with a 1-4 iteration gradient descent algorithm for inference. Experimental validation on unseen data shows that the ARF approach obtains an improved benchmark performance as well as a 1000-3000 times speedup compared to the Fields of Experts MRF. Using the ARF approach, image denoising can be performed in real-time, at 8 fps on a single CPU for a 256times256 image sequence, with close to state-of-the-art accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2028254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5286712/05173526.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2028254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286712","startPage":"2451","endPage":"2462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training an Active Random Field for Real-Time Image Denoising","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Training an Active Random Field for Real-Time Image Denoising","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918085","pubMedId":"19635701","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training an Active Random Field for Real-Time Image Denoising","sourcePdf":"18tip11-abarbu-2028254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121542S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5286712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5286712","articleId":"5173526","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173527,"authors":[{"name":"Taiping Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Taiping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37574992400"},{"name":"Yuan Yan Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan Yan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37290772600"},{"name":"Bin Fang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Fang","id":"37302285100"},{"name":"Zhaowei Shang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaowei","lastName":"Shang","id":"37286434500"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Physics Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Liu","id":"38009046100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"5173527","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":297,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3676},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Lighting","Image databases","Feature extraction","Image processing","Image segmentation","Robustness","Pixel","Power measurement","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","illumination","gradient faces","image gradient domain","feature extraction","PIE database","uncontrolled natural lighting conditions","Yale database","image noise","object artifacts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","gradientfaces","gradient domain","illumination insensitive measure"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Databases, Factual","Face","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Lighting","Normal Distribution","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, we propose a novel method to extract illumination insensitive features for face recognition under varying lighting called the gradient faces. Theoretical analysis shows gradient faces is an illumination insensitive measure, and robust to different illumination, including uncontrolled, natural lighting. In addition, gradient faces is derived from the image gradient domain such that it can discover underlying inherent structure of face images since the gradient domain explicitly considers the relationships between neighboring pixel points. Therefore, gradient faces has more discriminating power than the illumination insensitive measure extracted from the pixel domain. Recognition rates of 99.83% achieved on PIE database of 68 subjects, 98.96% achieved on Yale B of ten subjects, and 95.61% achieved on Outdoor database of 132 subjects under uncontrolled natural lighting conditions show that gradient faces is an effective method for face recognition under varying illumination. Furthermore, the experimental results on Yale database validate that gradient faces is also insensitive to image noise and object artifacts (such as facial expressions).","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2028255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5286712/05173527.pdf","startPage":"2599","endPage":"2606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2028255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Under Varying Illumination Using Gradientfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173527/","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Under Varying Illumination Using Gradientfaces","volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918091","pubMedId":"19635700","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173527/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Under Varying Illumination Using Gradientfaces","sourcePdf":"18tip11-tzhang-2028255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156143S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5286712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"297","xplore-issue":"5286712","articleId":"5173527","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":5173528,"authors":[{"name":"Chow Yin Lai","affiliation":["NUS Graduate School of Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5379132/5173528/5173528-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chow Yin Lai (S\u201908) received the Dipl.Ing.

The first NN utilizes accelerometer signal to detect external vibrations and compensates for its effect on HDD position via feedforward action. The second NN is designed to compensate for pivot friction. The appealing advantage of the NN compensators is that the design does not involve any information on the plant, sensor, disturbance dynamics, and friction model. The stability of the proposed scheme is analyzed by the Lyapunov criterion. Experimental results show that the tracking performance of the HDDs can be improved significantly with the use of the NN compensators as compared to the case without compensation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2027257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379132","startPage":"784","endPage":"792","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5379132/05173528.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disturbance and Friction Compensations in Hard Disk Drives Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173528/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Disturbance and Friction Compensations in Hard Disk Drives Using Neural Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054647","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disturbance and Friction Compensations in Hard Disk Drives Using Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-lai-2027257.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095017S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5379132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5379132","articleId":"5173528","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173535,"authors":[{"name":"Anup Doshi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Safe and Intelligent Automobiles (LISA), University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/5230362/5173535/5173535-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anup Doshi (S'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2005.

With the design of a simple and robust ADAS in mind, we are interested in determining the most important driver cues for distinguishing driver intent. Eye gaze may provide a more accurate proxy than head movement for determining driver attention, whereas the measurement of head motion is less cumbersome and more reliable in harsh driving conditions. We use a lane-change intent-prediction system (McCall et al., 2007) to determine the relative usefulness of each cue for determining intent. Various combinations of input data are presented to a discriminative classifier, which is trained to output a prediction of probable lane-change maneuver at a particular point in the future. Quantitative results from a naturalistic driving study are presented and show that head motion, when combined with lane position and vehicle dynamics, is a reliable cue for lane-change intent prediction. The addition of eye gaze does not improve performance as much as simpler head dynamics cues. The advantage of head data over eye data is shown to be statistically significant (p < 0.01) 3 s ahead of lane-change situations, indicating that there may be a biological basis for head motion to begin earlier than eye motion during \"lane-change\"-related gaze shifts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic heads","Vehicle dynamics","Road accidents","Intelligent sensors","Intelligent systems","Robustness","Intelligent vehicles","Alarm systems","Sensor systems","Intelligent transportation systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eye gaze","head dynamics","driver behavioral cues","intelligent advanced driver-assistance systems","lane-change intent-prediction system","lane position","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driver-assistance systems","driver behavior","driver intent inference","intelligent vehicles","machine vision","sparse Bayesian learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TITS.2009.2026675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5230362/05173535.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2009.2026675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Roles of Eye Gaze and Head Dynamics in Predicting Driver's Intent to Change Lanes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Roles of Eye Gaze and Head Dynamics in Predicting Driver's Intent to Change Lanes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173535/","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173535/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10847384","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Roles of Eye Gaze and Head Dynamics in Predicting Driver's Intent to Change Lanes","sourcePdf":"tits-doshi-2026675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090494S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5230362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"5230362","articleId":"5173535","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":5173536,"authors":[{"name":"Tolga Tasdizen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5306041/5173536/5173536-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tolga Tasdizen (S'98\u2013M'00\u2013SM'09) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Bogazici University in 1995 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in engineering from Brown University, Providence, RI, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.","After a postdoctoral researcher position in the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute at the University of Utah, he was a Research Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at the same institution.

Image neighborhood vectors are first projected onto a lower dimensional subspace using PCA. The dimensionality of this subspace is chosen automatically using parallel analysis. Consequently, neighborhood similarity weights for denoising are computed using distances in this subspace rather than the full space. The resulting algorithm is referred to as principal neighborhood dictionary (PND) nonlocal means. We investigate PND's accuracy as a function of the dimensionality of the projection subspace and demonstrate that denoising accuracy peaks at a relatively low number of dimensions. The accuracy of NLM and PND are also examined with respect to the choice of image neighborhood and search window sizes. Finally, we present a quantitative and qualitative comparison of PND versus NLM and another image neighborhood PCA-based state-of-the-art image denoising algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173536/","volume":"18","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5173536/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966850","pubMedId":"19635697","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Principal Neighborhood Dictionaries for Nonlocal Means Image Denoising","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principal Neighborhood Dictionaries for Nonlocal Means Image Denoising","sourcePdf":"18tip11-ttasdizen-2028259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088496S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5306041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"5306041","articleId":"5173536","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5173540,"authors":[{"name":"Arturas Zukauskas","affiliation":["Institute of Materials Science and Applied Research, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/5191271/5173540/5173540-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Art\u016bras \u017dukauskas (M\u201908\u2212SM\u201909) was born in Vilnius, Lithuania on November 22, 1956.

In combination with the correlated color temperature, these indexes, which represent important color quality characteristics of white light, constitute a simple 4-D metric for an advanced rating of illumination-grade lamps.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuits","Testing","Color","Fluorescent lamps","Light emitting diodes","Light sources","LED lamps","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brightness","colour","lamps","spectrophotometry","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color quality","solid-state lamps","fluorescent lamps","Munsell palette","spectrophotometry","color rendition vectors","luminance","chromaticity","color discrimination shapes","statistical analysis","fidelity","saturation","hue distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color rendering","fluorescent lamps","LEDs","solid-state lighting"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2019113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5191271/05173540.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2019113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical approach to color quality of solid-state lamps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical approach to color quality of solid-state lamps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173540/","volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-aug. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173540/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10805336","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical approach to color quality of solid-state lamps","sourcePdf":"jstqe-zukauskas-2019113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09701S","chronDate":"July-aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5191271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5191271","articleId":"5173540","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173557,"authors":[{"name":"Nader Jalili","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5204513/5173557/5173557-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nader Jalili received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1992 and 1995, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Connecticut, Storrs, in 1998.","He was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Northern Illinois University, DeKalb.

The microphone signals can be processed by a procedure based on speech distortion weighted multichannel Wiener filtering (SDW-MWF) to achieve significant noise reduction in a speech + noise scenario. In binaural procedures, it is also desirable to preserve binaural cues, in particular the interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD), which are used to localize sounds. It has been shown in previous work that the binaural SDW-MWF procedure only preserves these binaural cues for the desired speech source, but distorts the noise binaural cues. Two extensions of the binaural SDW-MWF have therefore been proposed to improve the binaural cue preservation, namely the MWF with partial noise estimation (MWF-eta) and MWF with interaural transfer function extension (MWF-ITF). In this paper, the binaural cue preservation of these extensions is analyzed theoretically and tested based on objective performance measures. Both extensions are able to preserve binaural cues for the speech and noise sources, while still achieving significant noise reduction performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10984325","htmlLink":"/document/5173569/","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical Analysis of Binaural Multimicrophone Noise Reduction Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical Analysis of Binaural Multimicrophone Noise Reduction Techniques","sourcePdf":"17tasl08-bcornelis-2028374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087927S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5325825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5325825","articleId":"5173569","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5173571,"authors":[{"name":"Jiwon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5383378/5173571/5173571-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiwon Kang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003, 2005, and 2009, respectively.","His current research interests are concentrated on multiuser multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems such as uplink, downlink, and multicell systems, including relaying and cooperative MIMO systems."]},"firstName":"Jiwon","lastName":"Kang","id":"37533012600"},{"name":"Hakju Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5383378/5173571/5173571-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hakju Lee received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998, 2001, and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Engineer with the Digital Media and Communications Research Center, Samsung Electronics, Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea.

Two schedulers, which are denoted by the control variance (CV) scheduler and the control mean (CM) scheduler, are proposed in this paper. The proposed schedulers have a beneficial characteristic wherein parameters of the schedulers are independent of channel statistics. Due to this characteristic, the parameters can be precalculated and then applied in the systems where only a limited number of desired ratios exist. For the systems that include an infinitely or extremely large number of desired ratios, parameter computation for the CV scheduler is greatly simplified by eliminating integral calculations. An approximation of the complementary error function is applied for simplification. Simulation results show that the proposed schedulers achieve nearly the maximum system throughput, and the Gaussian assumption and the approximation of the complementary error function cause a negligible error on the time-slot allocation ratio, even in MIMO systems equipped with a small number of antennas.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2028347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5383378/05173571.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2028347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383378","startPage":"170","endPage":"181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient MIMO Scheduling Algorithms With a Fixed-Time Allocation Ratio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient MIMO Scheduling Algorithms With a Fixed-Time Allocation Ratio","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070316","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5173571/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient MIMO Scheduling Algorithms With a Fixed-Time Allocation Ratio","sourcePdf":"tvt-kang-2028347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097012S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"5383378","articleId":"5173571","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173582,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth L.

With the large tip-tilt-piston scan ranges and low driving voltage, this type of device is very suitable for biomedical imaging and laser beam steering applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5272985/05173583.pdf","startPage":"1004","endPage":"1015","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2023838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2009.2023838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Electrothermal Tip\u2013Tilt\u2013Piston Micromirror Based on Folded Dual S-Shaped Bimorphs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrothermal effects","Micromirrors","Pistons","Optical device fabrication","Testing","Biomedical optical imaging","Micromachining","Optical design","Design optimization","Apertures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic testing","micromachining","micromirrors","micro-optomechanical devices","optical design techniques","optical fabrication","optical testing","silicon-on-insulator"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrothermal tip-tilt-piston micromirror","folded dual s-shaped bimorphs","thin-film surface micromachining","bulk silicon micromachining","silicon-on-insulator wafer","out-of-plane piston actuation","dynamic testing","thermal response time","size 1 mm","frequency 336 Hz","frequency 488 Hz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bimorph actuator","microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)","micromirror","microoptoelectromechanical systems","silicon-on-insulator (SOI)","tip\u2013tilt\u2013piston (TTP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Electrothermal Tip\u2013Tilt\u2013Piston Micromirror Based on Folded Dual S-Shaped Bimorphs","volume":"18","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5173583/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10891841","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Electrothermal Tip\u2013Tilt\u2013Piston Micromirror Based on Folded Dual S-Shaped Bimorphs","sourcePdf":"jmems-jia-2023838.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095245S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5272985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5272985","articleId":"5173583","onlineDate":"24 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173584,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Serrano-Gotarredona","affiliation":["Austria Microsystems AG, Valencia, Spain","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Seville Microelectronics Institute, Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5230374/5173584/5173584-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rafael Serrano-Gotarredona received the B.S. degree in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree [after completing all his research at the Seville Microelectronics Institute (IMSE), which is one of the institutes of the National Microelectronics Center (CNM) of the \u201cSpanish Research Council (CSIC) of Spain] from the University of Seville, Seville, Spain, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.

All circuit blocks are realized using sub-1.0 V topologies, that feature only a single high-frequency transistor between the supply and ground, and which are scalable to future 45 nm, 32 nm, and 22 nm CMOS nodes. The transceiver is fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process with a digital back-end. It includes a receiver with 14.7 dB gain and 5.6 dB noise figure, a 60 GHz LO distribution tree, a 69 GHz static frequency divider, and a direct BPSK modulator operating over the 55-65 GHz band at data rates exceeding 6 Gb/s.

Due to the dimensions of the MEMS device (e.g., 25 mum by 114 mum), the entire system with a total area of 6.25 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n can be housed in a small standard chip package. This considerably reduces the form factor and cost of the system, compared to using an external crystal as a reference. The MEMS resonators are clamped-clamped beams fabricated using a CMOS-compatible process. The main structural layer is made of silicon carbide, which provides the resonators with higher power handling capabilities and higher operating frequencies, compared to silicon. The resonators are electrostatically and thermally tunable - an 8.4% frequency tuning is demonstrated for a 9 MHz resonator. The 100 nm vertical transducer gaps of the resonators allow the use of electrostatic actuation voltages as low as 2 V. An integrated high gain-bandwidth trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) is combined with a resonator to generate the synthesizer's input reference signal. The TIA employs automatic gain control to mitigate the inherent low power handling capabilities and the non-linearities of the MEMS device, thus minimizing their effect on phase noise. The fractional- N synthesizer employs a 3rd-order 20-bit delta-sigma modulator to deliver a theoretical output resolution of ~ 11 Hz, in order to allow for high output frequency stability when used with an appropriate feedback loop. A fully integrated on-chip dual path loop filter is used to maintain a high level of system integration. With a supply voltage of 2 V, the phase noise for a 1.8 GHz output frequency and a ~12 MHz reference signal is -122 dBc/Hz at a 600 kHz offset, and -137 dBc/Hz at a 3 MHz offset.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022914","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5173690/05173754.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173690","startPage":"2154","endPage":"2168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Highly Integrated 1.8 GHz Frequency Synthesizer Based on a MEMS Resonator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Highly Integrated 1.8 GHz Frequency Synthesizer Based on a MEMS Resonator","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793432","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173754/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Highly Integrated 1.8 GHz Frequency Synthesizer Based on a MEMS Resonator","sourcePdf":"44jssc08-fnabki-2022914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.209448S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5173690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5173690","articleId":"5173754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5173763,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Teck Pang","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

In comparison to a previous 90 nm experiment, gate proximity now contributes less to frequency variability, causing a 2% change in overall performance, while strain has increased its contribution to about 5% of the overall performance.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173690","startPage":"2233","endPage":"2243","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5173690/05173763.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and Analysis of Variability in 45 nm Strained-Si CMOS Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Circuit testing","Manufacturing processes","Ring oscillators","Capacitive sensors","CMOS process","Space technology","Leakage current","Current measurement","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS digital integrated circuits","elemental semiconductors","leakage currents","silicon","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["strained-Si CMOS technology","CMOS circuits","layout-induced variation","die-to-die variability","wafer-to-wafer variability","within-die variability","delay","ring oscillators","transistor leakage current","on-chip ADC","gate patterning","gate proximity","size 45 nm","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["45 nm","CMOS","layout","leakage","ring oscillators","strain","variability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and Analysis of Variability in 45 nm Strained-Si CMOS Technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5173763/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10799264","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and Analysis of Variability in 45 nm Strained-Si CMOS Technology","sourcePdf":"44jssc08-bnikolic-2022217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068632S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5173690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5173690","articleId":"5173763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5173764,"authors":[{"name":"Noboru Sakimura","affiliation":["MRAM Technology Group, Device Platforms Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5173690/5173764/5173764-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Noboru Sakimura received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Hiroshima University, Higashi, Hiroshima, Japan, in 1996 and 1998, respectively.","In 1998, he joined the Silicon System Laboratories, NEC Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan, where he engaged in research and development of wide bandwidth delta-sigma ADCs.

An MFF primitive cell for design libraries has been developed using 150 nm, 1.5 V CMOS and 240 nm MRAM processes. It has advantages over other nonvolatile flip-flops in high-speed store operations without endurance limitations. It also has high design compatibility with conventional CMOS LSI designs because it does not include any additional power lines and special transistors. A toggle frequency of 3.5 GHz was achieved by a SPICE simulation, which is comparable to that of a normal CMOS DFF in the same generation. The maximum frequency in a store operation was also estimated to be 500 MHz with 1-ns current width for the data backup. An MFF test chip, which includes 16-stage 8-bit shift register using MFFs, was fabricated with these processes. A 333 MHz store operation was measured without failed bits. The functional performance was sufficiently high to demonstrate the potential of MFFs, which helps to reduce the power dissipation of systems on chips (SoCs) dramatically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","volume":"44","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10799265","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5173764/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Nonvolatile Magnetic Flip-Flop for Standby-Power-Free SoCs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonvolatile Magnetic Flip-Flop for Standby-Power-Free SoCs","sourcePdf":"44jssc08-nsakimura-2023192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088652S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5173690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5173690","articleId":"5173764","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5173768,"authors":[{"name":"Masum Hossain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5173690/5173768/5173768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masum Hossain received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh, and the M.Sc. degree from Queen's University, Canada, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

A low power clock source is demonstrated by incorporating a buffer into a cross-coupled oscillator. Because the load is isolated from the tank, the oscillator can directly drive 50-Ohm impedances or large capacitive loads with no additional buffering. Using this topology, a quadrature VCO (QVCO) is implemented in 0.13 mum digital CMOS. The QVCO oscillates at 20 GHz, consumes 20 mW and provides 12% tuning range. The measured phase noise is -101 dBc/Hz @ 1 MHz frequency offset. A clock alignment technique based upon injection-locked quadrature-LC or ring oscillators is then proposed. Although injection-locked oscillators (ILOs) are known to be capable of deskewing and jitter filtering clocks, a study of both LC and ring ILOs indicates significant variation in their jitter tracking bandwidth when used to provide large phase shifts. By selectively injecting different phases of a quadrature-LC or ring VCO, this problem is obviated resulting in reduced phase noise. The technique is demonstrated using a LC QVCO at 20 GHz while burning only 20 mW of power and providing an 8 dB improvement in phase noise. A ring oscillator deskews a 2 to 7 GHz clock while consuming 14 mW in 90 nm CMOS.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5173690/05173768.pdf","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS Oscillators for Clock Distribution and Injection-Locked Deskew","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173768/","displayDocTitle":"CMOS Oscillators for Clock Distribution and Injection-Locked Deskew","volume":"44","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793429","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173768/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS Oscillators for Clock Distribution and Injection-Locked Deskew","sourcePdf":"44jssc08-mhossain-2022917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082715S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5173690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5173690","articleId":"5173768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173771,"authors":[{"name":"Vipul Jain","affiliation":["Nanoscale Communication IC (NCIC) Laboratory, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5173690/5173771/5173771-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vipul Jain (S'01) was born in India in 1983.

Enabling the use of low gain opamps also allows low-voltage operation due to the reduced number of transistors between the power supply rails. In addition, all the digital filters are removed from the output of this modulator to minimize the overall system requirement. Instead, an in-loop digital addition facilitates the desired noise transfer functions of both loops. This combines stability advantage of the multi-loop structure with relaxed circuit requirement of the single-loop modulator. A fourth order modulator is implemented in a 0.18 mum CMOS technology to demonstrate this concept. Measurement results show that, with open-loop opamp gain of less than 35 dB, the implemented prototype IC achieves over 74 dB SNDR at an oversampling ratio of 16. The sampling frequency is 20 MHz and the total power dissipation is 3.2 mW at 1.2 V supply.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5173690/05173775.pdf","startPage":"2212","endPage":"2221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"74 dB SNDR Multi-Loop Sturdy-MASH Delta-Sigma Modulator Using 35 dB Open-Loop Opamp Gain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173775/","displayDocTitle":"74 dB SNDR Multi-Loop Sturdy-MASH Delta-Sigma Modulator Using 35 dB Open-Loop Opamp Gain","volume":"44","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10793434","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173775/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"74 dB SNDR Multi-Loop Sturdy-MASH Delta-Sigma Modulator Using 35 dB Open-Loop Opamp Gain","sourcePdf":"44jssc08-nmaghari-2022302.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079351S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5173690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5173690","articleId":"5173775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173778,"authors":[{"name":"Xueyi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5173690/5173778/5173778-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xueyi Yu received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004.

Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively suppress out-of-band phase noise to meet the phase noise mask requirements in various RF applications.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5173690/05173778.pdf","startPage":"2193","endPage":"2201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5173690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A - Fractional-N Synthesizer With Customized Noise Shaping for WCDMA/HSDPA Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5173778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5173778/","displayDocTitle":"A <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\Delta\\Sigma$</tex> </formula> Fractional-N Synthesizer With Customized Noise Shaping for WCDMA/HSDPA Applications","volume":"44","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10799268","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5173778/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\Delta\\Sigma$</tex> </formula> Fractional-N Synthesizer With Customized Noise Shaping for WCDMA/HSDPA Applications","sourcePdf":"jssc-yu-2022301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065596S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5173690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5173690","articleId":"5173778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5173900,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Park","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Park","id":"37960470400"},{"name":"Mark Yim","affiliation":["GRASP Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Yim","id":"37274063600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-88-89007-37-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-876346-58-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5173900","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed control","Fault tolerance","Centralized control","Robustness","Communication system control","Robot kinematics","Fault tolerant systems","Robust control","Control systems","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","fault tolerance","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","communication fault tolerance","CKBot","modular robotic system","broadcast infrared signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modular robots","fault tolerance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a method for distributed fault tolerance in a modular robotic system.

One way to improve security is to use spreading code diversity to transmit user information, a technique known as multi-code CDMA. In this paper, we present a new method of generating codes for multi-code CDMA that exhibit low probability of detection (LPD) and low probability of interception (LPI) while achieving near single code performance. The codes are calculated by first estimating the channel and interference plus noise covariance matrix, denoted Q. The eigenvectors of the resultant matrix are fed into a filter that performs a series of orthogonal projections to generate the codes. This results in codes that are R-conjugate, i.e. maintain orthogonality after propagating through the channel. The unknown channel must be estimated, but since it is time-varying, the resulting codes are dynamic. The LPD/LPI characteristics come about because the filter produces codes with random amplitudes. We demonstrate that these codes perform as well as the previously introduced R-conjugate codes based on eigen-decomposition of the interference plus noise covariance matrix, by maintaining the R-conjugate properties. Furthermore, if the channel can be accurately estimated, then we can achieve near ideal performance. This requires a slow fading channel which remains approximately constant over a block size M > 20N, where N is the length of the spreading code. We also illustrate the improved LPD/LPI properties of the codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Southeastcon 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165454/5174034/05174065.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Southeastcon 2009","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2009.5174065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2009.5174065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low probability of intercept R-Conjugate CDMA codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference","Covariance matrix","Information security","Filters","Working environment noise","Transmitters","Multipath channels","Bit error rate","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel estimation","code division multiple access","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","fading channels","military communication","probability","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low probability-of-interception","R-conjugate CDMA codes","code division multiple access","cellular application","military applications","spreading code diversity","low probability-of-detection","channel estimation","interference plus noise covariance matrix","time-varying channel","eigen-decomposition","fading channel","LPD-LPI properties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low probability of intercept R-Conjugate CDMA codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174065/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10799930","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low probability of intercept R-Conjugate CDMA codes","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"Session07-01_Page142_SEC09Paper008_PID895412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051407S","chronDate":"5-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5165454","isNumber":"5174034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5165454","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5174034","articleId":"5174065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5174066,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Embrey-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jianhua Liu","id":"37279464300"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Jian Li","id":"37279843500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3976-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3978-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-0050"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-058X"}],"articleNumber":"5174066","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-varying channels","Signal design","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency division multiplexing","Broadband communication","Wireless communication","Time varying systems","Frequency-selective fading channels","Block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","broadband networks","channel coding","fading channels","forward error correction","mobile radio","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","signal detection","space-time codes","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel updating/tacking-based coherent detection","OFDM-based STBC system","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","mobile broadband wireless communication system","time-varying frequency-selective fading channel","space-time block coding","STBC differential modulation","packet design","signal processing algorithm","forward error correction coding aided decision feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","STBC","MIMO","Decision feedback","Channel tracking","Wireless LAN standards"]}],"abstract":"We consider improving the performance of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based mobile broadband wireless communication (MBWC) systems over time-varying frequency-selective fading channels.

The number of multiple steps in the Haar wavelet transform magnitude was first detected through finding the numbers of peaks in the histogram of the Haar wavelet transform magnitude.

Genetic Algorithm (GA), a widely-used evolutionary meta-heuristic optimization method, is a unique candidate in this class of applications and demonstrates significant amount of explicit and implicit parallelism. In this paper, we present the performance characteristics of a GA optimizing a placement problem on a Sun UltraSPARC T1 processor. To investigate the behavior of the benchmark, we vary both algorithm-specific parameters as well as the size of the target problem. The system performance is evaluated by monitoring throughput, cycle-per-instruction (CPI) and, the memory access patterns for different core and thread combinations. Our experiments show that for a constant data size, as the number of threads per core increase from 1 to 4, the throughput of the system increases by 84% keeping all cores active. Similarly, as we increase the number of cores in the system, the throughput of the system increases by a factor of 3. The average memory bandwidth is seen to scale in proportion to throughput for both core-scaling and thread-scaling. The overall increase in throughput, either by core-scaling or thread-scaling, in spite of growing memory bandwidth, shows the ability of the multi-threaded multi-core processor to hide long latency memory accesses for the targeted benchmark.","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2009.5174094","startPage":"301","endPage":"306","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Southeastcon 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165454/5174034/05174094.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Southeastcon 2009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2009.5174094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithms on the multi-core sun UltraSPARC T1","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Genetic algorithms","Sun","Throughput","Multicore processing","Yarn","Bandwidth","Hardware","Optimization methods","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","parallel processing","performance evaluation","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithms","multi-core Sun UltraSPARC Tl","shared memory multi-core processors","multiple parallel execution paths","task-level parallelism","evolutionary meta-heuristic optimization","cycle-per-instruction","memory access patterns","multi-threaded multi-core processor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithms on the multi-core sun UltraSPARC T1","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174094/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10799959","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of coarse-grained parallel genetic algorithms on the multi-core sun UltraSPARC T1","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"Session13-04_Page301_SEC09Paper089_PID896072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06913S","chronDate":"5-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5165454","isNumber":"5174034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5165454","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5174034","articleId":"5174094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5174096,"authors":[{"name":"Jared Harwayne-Gidansky","affiliation":["The Center of Signal Processing, Communications and Computer Engineering Research, The Cooper Union of the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165454/5174034/5174096/5174096-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jared Harwayne-Gidansky (S'06-GS'08) received the B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.

As the number of threats and network speeds increase (over 1 gigabit/sec), users of conventional software based NID methods must choose between protection or higher data rates. To address this shortcoming, we have designed a hardware-based NID system-on-a-chip using data structures called Counting Bloom Filters (CBFs). Our design has extremely high throughput (up to 3.3 gigabits/sec) and can successfully detect and mitigate known threats, and is, to our knowledge, the only known CBF based NID system-on-a-chip to be implemented on a Virtex 4 FPGA. In this project, we present the first optimized, Counting Bloom Filter based Network Intrusion Detection FPGA SoC (system-on-chip) implemented on a Virtex 4 FPGA: our design is scalable through further parallelization and, to our knowledge, is one of the highest throughput NID systems in existence.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Southeastcon 2009","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165454/5174034/05174096.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Southeastcon 2009","doi":"10.1109/SECON.2009.5174096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECON.2009.5174096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based SoC for real-time network intrusion detection using counting bloom filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","System-on-a-chip","Filters","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer hacking","Throughput","Computer networks","Face detection","Computer viruses","National security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","optimisation","security of data","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based SoC","real-time network intrusion detection","counting bloom filter optimisation","virus threat prevention","hacker threat","financial security","national security","end-user machine","NID system-on-a-chip","CBF based NID","FPGA scalable parallelization design","Virtex 4 FPGA","bit rate 1 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data structures","Computer network security","Field programmable gate arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based SoC for real-time network intrusion detection using counting bloom filters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174096/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10799961","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"5-8 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based SoC for real-time network intrusion detection using counting bloom filters","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"Session13-05_Page452_SEC09Paper100_PID910613.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109159S","chronDate":"5-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5165454","isNumber":"5174034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5165454","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5174034","articleId":"5174096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5174098,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Generally, these models are represented as partial differential equations(PDEs) which can be solved numerically using meshes and sparse matrices. The solution cost of sparse linear systems, typically, dominates the solution cost of these PDEs. Consequently, an efficient sparse linear solver is essential in scientific and engineering simulations. Researches have been focused on solving large scale problems using clustered systems using MPI programming. With the advent of multicore architecture, exploring parallelism on a single computer is getting popular. However, we do not have proper scientific algorithms to take advantages of this new architecture paradigm. In this paper, we introduce a multithreaded Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) algorithm, namely mtPCG, which explores parallelism on multicore architectures. We also analyzed the performance and scalability of mtPCG on multicore architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5174098/","accessionNumber":"10799963","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing multithreaded preconditioned conjugate gradient (mtPCG) algorithm on multicore architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing multithreaded preconditioned conjugate gradient (mtPCG) algorithm on multicore architecture","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"Session13-07_Page317_SEC09Paper143_PID894419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105805S","chronDate":"5-8 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5165454","isNumber":"5174034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5165454","xplore-issue":"5174034","articleId":"5174098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5174109,"authors":[{"name":"Payam Shoghi","affiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Payam","lastName":"Shoghi","id":"37402984900"},{"name":"Thomas P.

The SDLVA design includes feedback compensation for DC offset error, and is tailored to accommodate the zero-IF architecture of the spectrum analyzer without the need for large off-chip capacitors. The SDLVA was designed and fabricated in 0.5 micron CMOS. Experimental results for the SDLVA are presented showing approximately 40 dB dynamic range.

On this basis, considering how to improve the throughput can make CR MAC protocol more meaningful. To achieve these goals, in this paper a TDMA based multi-channel cognitive radio MAC (MCR-MAC) protocol is proposed for wireless ad hoc network that provides for cooperative detection and protection of incumbent systems around communication pair. By mainly focusing on possible signal collisions between incumbent devices and cognitive radio ad hoc devices, any kind of the hidden incumbent terminal problem is handled in our proposed scheme. To this end, a simple but efficient emergency notification exchanging mechanism between neighbor nodes with little overhead is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed MCR-MAC can reduce interference on incumbents greatly and improve the throughput remarkably.","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2009.5174275","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166088/5174262/05174275.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2009.5174275","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","startPage":"6","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MCR-MAC: Multi-channel cognitive radio MAC protocol for cooperative incumbent system protection in wireless ad-hoc network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"MCR-MAC: Multi-channel cognitive radio MAC protocol for cooperative incumbent system protection in wireless ad-hoc network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174275/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174275/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10799802","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MCR-MAC: Multi-channel cognitive radio MAC protocol for cooperative incumbent system protection in wireless ad-hoc network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"1A-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062044S","chronDate":"7-9 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166088","isNumber":"5174262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166088","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5174262","articleId":"5174275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5174276,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Zaman Chowdhury","affiliation":["Kookmin University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mostafa Zaman","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37535088600"},{"name":"Sunwoong Choi","affiliation":["South Korea"],"lastName":"Sunwoong Choi","id":"37676420600"},{"name":"Yeong Min Jang","affiliation":["Kookmin University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yeong Min Jang","id":"37536259400"},{"name":"Kap-Suk Park","affiliation":["Korea Telecom, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kap-Suk","lastName":"Park","id":"38009870400"},{"name":"Geun Il Yoo","affiliation":["Korea Telecom, South Korea"],"firstName":"Geun Il","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37993595300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4215-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4216-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"5174276","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":328},"abstract":"The satisfaction level of femtocell users depends on the availability of requested bandwidth. But, the xDSL line that can be used for the backhauling of femtocell traffic cannot always provide sufficient bandwidth due to the inequality between the xDSL capacity and demanded bandwidth of home applications, like IPTV, PC, Wi-Fi, and others. A service level agreement (SLA) between xDSL and the femtocell operator (mobile operator) to reserve some bandwidth for the upcoming femtocell calls can increase the satisfaction level for femtocell users. In this paper, we propose a SLA negotiation procedure for femtocell networks. The Bandwidth Broker controls the allocated bandwidth for femtocell users. Then, we propose the dynamically reserved bandwidth scheme to increase the femtocell user's satisfaction level. Finally, we present our simulation results to validate the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166088/5174262/05174276.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICUFN.2009.5174276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUFN.2009.5174276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174262","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic SLA negotiation using bandwidth broker for femtocell networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Femtocell networks","Financial advantage program","Quality of service","Telecommunication traffic","Delay","DSL","History","IPTV","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","cellular radio","digital subscriber lines","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic SLA negotiation","bandwidth broker","femtocell network","xDSL line","femtocell traffic","service level agreement","dynamic bandwidth allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["xDSL","FAP","femtocell","QoS","Bandwidth Broker","SLA","bandwidth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic SLA negotiation using bandwidth broker for femtocell networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174276/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10799803","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","conferenceDate":"7-9 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic SLA negotiation using bandwidth broker for femtocell networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"1A-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072461S","chronDate":"7-9 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166088","isNumber":"5174262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166088","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5174262","articleId":"5174276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5174277,"authors":[{"name":"Emran Mohammad Abu Anas","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Emran Mohammad","lastName":"Abu Anas","id":"38179772000"},{"name":"Atahar Kamal Mostafa","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Atahar Kamal","lastName":"Mostafa","id":"37994036300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4215-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4216-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8528"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8536"}],"articleNumber":"5174277","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Interference cancellation","Detectors","AWGN channels","Bit error rate","Frequency","Base stations","Spread spectrum communication","Multiple access interference","Multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","matrix algebra","radiofrequency interference","spread spectrum communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiaccess interference reduction","DS-CDMA","direct sequence code division multiple access","interference limited channel","correlation matrix","multistage scheme","memory allocation mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code division multiaccess","correlation","interference","matrix multiplication"]}],"abstract":"Direct sequence code division multiple access (DSCDMA) is mainly an interference limited channel.

Various mapping strategies have been proposed for the representation of genomic and proteomic sequences. However, little is understood about the effect of specific choices of numerical mappings on the final analysis results. In fact, inconsistent numerical mappings could have led to contradictory results in genomic sequence analysis. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework for analysis of the consistency in representation and transformation of numerical mappings of genomic sequences. We introduce strong and weak correlation metrics to characterize consistency measures among distinct numerical mappings. We derive sufficient conditions to ensure consistency among different numerical mappings. We present an important class of equivalent transforms under the proposed consistency conditions. We also derive a class of operators which is shown to be equivalent under rotation of numerical mappings. Finally, we conduct computer simulation experiments on DNA sequences which demonstrate the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/GENSIPS.2009.5174331","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166726/5174320/05174331.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GENSIPS.2009.5174331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistency in representation and transformation of genomic sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174331/","displayDocTitle":"Consistency in representation and transformation of genomic sequences","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10799763","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174331/","conferenceDate":"17-21 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistency in representation and transformation of genomic sequences","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"pap_4302_Wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067821S","chronDate":"17-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166726","isNumber":"5174320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166726","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5174320","articleId":"5174331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5174377,"authors":[{"name":"Raman Arora","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Raman","lastName":"Arora","id":"37631435800"},{"name":"Colin Dewey","affiliation":["Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Dewey","id":"37994248400"},{"name":"William A.

Such regions in genome sequences are modeled as cyclostationary processes, generated by a collection of information sources in a cyclic manner. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimates can be easily generated for the cyclostationary profiles and for the statistical period of such subsequences. However, in the presence of insertions and deletions, the ML estimators suffer greatly in their ability to accurately identify the periods. This paper extends the cyclic model to a profile hidden Markov model (PHMM) to account for insertions and deletions. An iterative algorithm is developed to learn parameters of the PHMM and Viterbi algorithm is employed to learn the most likely path through the state space. This reconstructs likely insertions and deletions in the sequence and results in better estimates of the statistical period and cyclostationary profiles than the ML approach. Experimental results are provided with simulated sequences as well as with chromosome 1 sequence from human genome.","doi":"10.1109/GENSIPS.2009.5174377","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166726/5174320/05174377.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GENSIPS.2009.5174377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174320","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstructing latent periods in genome sequences with insertions and deletions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reconstructing latent periods in genome sequences with insertions and deletions","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174377/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-21 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10799753","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5174377/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstructing latent periods in genome sequences with insertions and deletions","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"pap_4365_Arora.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041701S","chronDate":"17-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166726","isNumber":"5174320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166726","xplore-issue":"5174320","articleId":"5174377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5174387,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Chan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5174380/5174387/5174387-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jae Chan Lee was born in Daegu, Korea on November 22, 1978.

In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, detecting impulsive interference is challenging since both OFDM signals and impulsive noise follow Gaussian distributions.

The analysis of the false detection probability (FDP) and successful detection probability (SDP) is given. The results indicate that the proposed scheme detects impulsive noise efficiently. In addition, the closed-form expressions for the FDP and SDP of blanking nonlinearity scheme which is widely used to remove impulsive interference are also derived.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5174380/05174394.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5174394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5174394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174380","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient impulsive noise mitigation scheme for over-sampled OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Blanking","Interference","Gaussian noise","Additive white noise","Low pass filters","Gaussian distribution","Closed-form solution","Noise level","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","impulse noise","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive noise mitigation scheme","oversampled OFDM systems","wireless communication systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","impulsive interference detection","Gaussian distributions","windowing nonlinearity scheme","false detection probability","successful detection probability","closed-form expressions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impulsive noise, orthogonal frequency","division multiplexing (OFDM), over-sampling, blanking","nonlinearity, windowing nonlinearity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"An efficient impulsive noise mitigation scheme for over-sampled OFDM systems","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5174394/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10829231","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient impulsive noise mitigation scheme for over-sampled OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"p0360-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047757S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5174380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5174380","articleId":"5174394","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5174395,"authors":[{"name":"Jijun Zheng","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5174380/5174395/5174395-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jijun Zheng received B.S degree in Institute of Telecommunication engineering the airforce, Xian, Shanxi, China in 1994, and M.S degree in the School of Electronic Science & Engineering, Changsha, Hunan, China in 2003.

To improve the system performance in limitation of size and cost, the OFDM and MIMO techniques are adopted. Recently, cooperative diversity techniques are developed to be a solution. In this paper, we propose the carrier frequency offset mitigation scheme in cooperative communication using multi-symbol encapsulated orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MSE-OFDM), in which one cyclic prefix (CP) is used for multiple OFDM symbols. We use the FFT size-reduced MSE-OFDM system which can be used to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and improve the robustness to carrier frequency offset. The cooperative communication uses not only direct path from source to destination but also indirect path via relay station. Each different relays require more precise frequency synchronization and lower PAPR, so we adopt the MSEOFDM to increase the system performance. The performance analysis of cooperative MSE-OFDM in multipath fading channels has been done and the effect of carrier frequency offset and PAPR have been studied.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5174398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5174380/05174398.pdf","startPage":"385","endPage":"390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5174398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency offset mitigation of cooperative ofdm system in wireless digital broadcasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174398/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency offset mitigation of cooperative ofdm system in wireless digital broadcasting","volume":"55","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10829233","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174398/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency offset mitigation of cooperative ofdm system in wireless digital broadcasting","sourcePdf":"p0385-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046209S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5174380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5174380","articleId":"5174398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5174400,"authors":[{"name":"Yeong-Kang Lai","affiliation":["Department of the Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5174380/5174400/5174400-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yeong-Kang Lai was born in Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1966.

The Proposed 2-D DWT architecture are composed of two 1-D DWT cores and a 2times2 transposing register array. The proposed 1-D DWT core consumes two input data and produces two output coefficients per cycle, and its critical path takes one multiplier delay only. Moreover, we utilize the parallel scanning method to reduce the internal buffer size instead of the line-based scanning method. For the NtimesN tile image with one-level 2-D DWT decomposition, only 4N temporal memory and the 2times2 register array are required for 9/7 filter to store the intermediate coefficients in the column 1-D DWT core. And the column-processed data can be rearranged in the transposing array. According to the comparison results, the hardware cost of the 1-D DWT core and the internal memory requirements of proposed 2-D DWT architecture are smaller than other familiar architectures based on the same throughput rate.

This technology offers new and exciting opportunities to increase the connectivity of devices within the home for the purpose of home automation. Moreover, with the rapid expansion of the Internet, there is the added potential for the remote control and monitoring of such network enabled devices. However, the adoption of home automation systems has been slow. This paper identifies the reasons for this slow adoption and evaluates the potential of ZigBee for addressing these problems through the design and implementation of a flexible home automation architecture. A ZigBee based home automation system and Wi-Fi network are integrated through a common home gateway. The home gateway provides network interoperability, a simple and flexible user interface, and remote access to the system. A dedicated virtual home is implemented to cater for the system's security and safety needs. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system, four devices, a light switch, radiator valve, safety sensor and ZigBee remote control have been developed and evaluated with the home automation system.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5174403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5174380/05174403.pdf","startPage":"422","endPage":"430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5174403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A zigbee-based home automation system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"A zigbee-based home automation system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174403/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10839769","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174403/","volume":"55","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A zigbee-based home automation system","sourcePdf":"p0422-gill.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04134S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5174380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"332","xplore-issue":"5174380","articleId":"5174403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5174407,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Sha","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI design, Department of Physics, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5174380/5174407/5174407-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin Sha received the B.S. degree in physics and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.

The mounting time is 30 times faster compared to that of YAFFS, which is a well known file system for NAND flash memory, and the heap memory usage is only 5% of the YAFFS usage.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5174420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5174420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5174380/05174420.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded NAND flash file system for mobile multimedia devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Embedded NAND flash file system for mobile multimedia devices","volume":"55","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10829247","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174420/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded NAND flash file system for mobile multimedia devices","sourcePdf":"p0545-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039797S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5174380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5174380","articleId":"5174420","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5174421,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Lee","affiliation":["Digital Storage Research Laboratory, LG Electronics Company Limited, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5174380/5174421/5174421-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Lee received his B.S. and M.S. degree from Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

Under GS rules, a user word is translated into a plurality of possible candidate words, and among the candidate words the encoder selects the codeword with the least low-frequency spectral content. In our paper, we will present results of our attempts to improve the performance of GS-based codes. We will present new selection criteria and evaluate their performance and complexity.

Video surveillance can contribute to the safety of people in the home and ease control of home-entrance and equipment-usage functions. In this paper, we study a flexible framework for semantic analysis of human behavior from a monocular surveillance video, captured by a consumer camera. Successful trajectory estimation and human-body modeling facilitate the semantic analysis of human activities and events in video sequences. An additional contribution is the introduction of a 3-D reconstruction scheme for scene understanding, so that the actions of persons can be analyzed from different views. The total framework consists of four processing levels: (1) a preprocessing level including background modeling and multiple-person detection, (2) an object-based level performing trajectory estimation and posture classification, (3) an event-based level for semantic analysis, and (4) a visualization level including camera calibration and 3-D scene reconstruction. Our proposed framework was evaluated and has shown its good quality (86% accuracy of posture classification and 90% for events) and effectiveness, as it achieves a near real-time performance (6-8 frames/second).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174427/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10829251","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5174427/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic video-based human motion analyzer for consumer surveillance system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic video-based human motion analyzer for consumer surveillance system","sourcePdf":"p0591-lao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059547S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5174380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5174380","articleId":"5174427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5174435,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Tesoriero","affiliation":["Department of Informatics Systems, University of Castilla La Mancha, Albacete, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5174380/5174435/5174435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ricardo Tesoriero was born in Argentina on July 1st, 1977.

A new scan order is introduced to re-use the sum of absolute differences (SAD) values of smaller sub-blocks on an \"as-early-as-possible\" basis, thus the complexity of the required hardware resources, such as registers, multiplexers, and controls is reduced. It also spreads the timing for the final SAD outputs so that the number of output buses is reduced. The architecture is flexible and scalable with regard to the size of the searching windows and PE arrays. Compared to the conventional approaches, the architecture shows higher throughput rate with less hardware. After logic synthesis using DongbuAnam 0.18 mum standard cell library, the number of gates is 39K (16 PEs) in two-input equivalent NAND gates and the maximum operating clock frequency is 416 MHz (256 fps@CIF).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel VLSI architecture for full-search variable block-size motion estimation","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5174446","startPage":"728","endPage":"733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5174446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5174380/05174446.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel VLSI architecture for full-search variable block-size motion estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5174446/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10839786","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel VLSI architecture for full-search variable block-size motion estimation","sourcePdf":"p0728-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06654S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5174380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5174380","articleId":"5174446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5174451,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin P.

One bit transform (1BT) based ME algorithms have low computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose high performance systolic hardware architectures for 1BT based fixed block size (FBS) and variable block size (VBS) ME. The proposed ME hardware architectures perform full search ME for 4 Macroblocks in parallel and they are faster than the 1BT based ME hardware reported in the literature. They use less on-chip memory than the previous 1BT based ME hardware by using a novel data reuse scheme and memory organization. The proposed VBS ME hardware is the first 1BT based ME hardware implementing VBS ME. The proposed hardware architectures are implemented in Verilog HDL. The FBS ME and VBS ME hardware consume %34 and %49 of the slices in a Xilinx XC2VP30-7 FPGA, respectively. They can work at 113 MHz in the same FPGA and are capable of processing 49 1920times1080 full High Definition frames per second. Therefore, they can be used in consumer electronics products that require real-time video processing or compression.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2009.5174478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/5174380/05174478.pdf","startPage":"941","endPage":"949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2009.5174478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174380","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance hardware architectures for one bit transform based motion estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174478/","displayDocTitle":"High performance hardware architectures for one bit transform based motion estimation","volume":"55","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174478/","publicationDate":"May 2009","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10829286","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance hardware architectures for one bit transform based motion estimation","sourcePdf":"p0941-akin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050255S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"5174380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5174380","articleId":"5174478","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-24"},{"_id":5174479,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Al Ghouwayel","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Cesson-S\u00e9vign\u00e9, France","Lab-STICC Laboratory, Lorient, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/5174380/5174479/5174479-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Ghouwayel was born in Baalbeck (Lebanon) in 1980.

This article provides an overview of the state of the art of recent research activities in this field. It introduces energy detection and autocorrelation receiver front ends with a focus on architectures that perform the initial signal processing tasks in the analog domain, such that the receiver does not need to sample the UWB received signals at Nyquist rate. Common signaling and multiple access schemes are reviewed for both front ends. An elaborate section illustrates various performance tradeoffs to highlight preferred system choices. Practical issues are discussed, including, for low-data-rate schemes, the allowed power allocation per pulse according to the regulator's ruling and the estimated power consumption of a receiver chip. A large part is devoted to signal processing steps needed in a digital receiver. It starts with synchronization and time-of-arrival estimation schemes, introduces studies about the narrowband interference problem, and describes solutions for high-data-rate and multiple access communications. Drastic advantages concerning complexity and robustness justify the application of noncoherent UWB systems, particularly for low-data-rate systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5174379/05174497.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2009.932617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2009.932617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent ultra-wideband systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Bandwidth","Signal processing","Energy resolution","Signal resolution","Multipath channels","Fading","Autocorrelation","Energy consumption","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio receivers","signal processing","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncoherent ultra wideband system","low complexity device","low power consumption","noncoherent ultra wideband receiver","energy detection","autocorrelation receiver front end","signal processing","Nyquist rate","digital receiver","time-of-arrival estimation","multiple access communication","noncoherent UWB system","low data rate system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent ultra-wideband systems","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10794558","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent ultra-wideband systems","sourcePdf":"13-26msp04-witrisal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086085S","chronDate":"July  2009","isNumber":"5174379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"196","articleId":"5174497","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5174501,"authors":[{"name":"Janet M.

Two classes of these codes, referred to as Type-I and Type-II codes, are with row-weights 4 and 3, and maximum girths 16 and 24, respectively. The idea behind the construction of these two classes of codes, with rates at least 1/2 and 1/3, is slightly generalized to obtain two classes of variable-high-rate codes, referred to as Type-III1 and Type-III2 codes, with maximum girth 20 and 16, respectively. A low-complexity deterministic algorithm for constructing these four classes of codes is given. The algorithm generates maximum-girth Type-I and Type-II codes with almost arbitrary length eta not less than 216 and 243, respectively. The output of the algorithm substantially improves on some of the previously best known codes constructed using a randomized progressive edge-growth (RPEG) algorithm. For instance, we have rate-0.71 Type-III1 codes of lengths 308 and 728 with girths 10 and 12, respectively, versus the code lengths 385 and 840 obtained by the RPEG algorithm. Simulation results on AWGN channel confirm that, from BER performance perspective, the constructed LDPC codes are superior to the column-weight-two LDPC codes constructed by the previously reported methods.

Instantons are the most probable configurations of the channel noise which result in decoding failures. We show that the general idea and the respective optimization technique are applicable broadly to a variety of channels, discrete or continuous, and variety of sub-optimal decoders. Specifically, we consider: iterative belief propagation (BP) decoders, Gallager type decoders, and linear programming (LP) decoders performing over the additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC) and the binary symmetric channel (BSC). The instanton analysis suggests that the underlying topological structures of the most probable instanton of the same code but different channels and decoders are related to each other. Armed with this understanding of the graphical structure of the instanton and its relation to the decoding failures, we suggest a method to construct codes whose Tanner graphs are free of these structures, and thus have less significant error floors.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5174509/05174515.pdf","startPage":"855","endPage":"865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instanton-based techniques for analysis and reduction of error floors of LDPC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","displayDocTitle":"Instanton-based techniques for analysis and reduction of error floors of LDPC codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174515/","publicationDate":"August 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10794751","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174515/","volume":"27","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instanton-based techniques for analysis and reduction of error floors of LDPC codes","sourcePdf":"855jsac0609chilapp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112151S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5174509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5174509","articleId":"5174515","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5174516,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, HI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5174509/5174516/5174516-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaojun Yuan (S'04-M'08) received the B.S. degree in electronic and information systems from Shanghai Jiaotong University, the M.S. degree in circuit and systems from Fudan University, and the Ph.D degree at City University of Hong Kong.

A substantial limitation to the use of finite-length LDPC codes is the presence of an error floor in the low frame error rate (FER) region. This paper develops a deterministic method of predicting error floors, based on high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotics, applied to absorbing sets within structured LDPC codes. The approach is illustrated using a class of array-based LDPC codes, taken as exemplars of high-performance structured LDPC codes. The results are in very good agreement with a stochastic method based on importance sampling which, in turn, matches the hardware-based experimental results. The importance sampling scheme uses a mean-shifted version of the original Gaussian density, appropriately centered between a codeword and a dominant absorbing set, to produce an unbiased estimator of the FER with substantial computational savings over a standard Monte Carlo estimator. Our deterministic estimates are guaranteed to be a lower bound to the error probability in the high SNR regime, and extend the prediction of the error probability to as low as 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-30</sup>\n. By adopting a channel-independent viewpoint, the usefulness of these results is demonstrated for both the standard Gaussian channel and a channel with mixture noise.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090809","startPage":"908","endPage":"917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5174509/05174520.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting error floors of structured LDPC codes: deterministic bounds and estimates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Predicting error floors of structured LDPC codes: deterministic bounds and estimates","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10794756","publicationDate":"August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5174520/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting error floors of structured LDPC codes: deterministic bounds and estimates","sourcePdf":"908jsac0609dolocek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139232S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5174509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5174509","articleId":"5174520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5174521,"authors":[{"name":"Iryna Andriyanova","affiliation":["CNRS UMR 8051, ETIS Laboratory, ENSEA, UCP, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5174509/5174521/5174521-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Iryna Andriyanova received her PhD and MSc from the Communications&Electronics Department of National Superior School of Telecommunications (Telecom Paris'Tech), France, and BSc from the National Polytechnic University of Odessa, Ukraine.

We need a finite-length approximation that is valid for any code ensemble. The scaling approach seems to be a tool, general enough to provide such an approximation. However, the analytical derivation of parameters of the scaling approximation has been successful only for LDPC codes [1]; despite several attempts [25], [20], no such result was proposed for other code ensembles. In this paper, we focus on the finite-length performance of turbo-like codes, by applying the scaling approach to this case. In particular, by assuming the transmission over the binary erasure channel, we conjecture the scaling law and derive its scaling parameter. As examples, we present the performance estimation for Repeat-Accumulate codes [11], parallel turbo codes [8] and TLDPC codes [5], in all cases matching well the numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5174509/05174521.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-length scaling of turbo-like code ensembles on the binary erasure channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Finite-length scaling of turbo-like code ensembles on the binary erasure channel","volume":"27","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174521/","publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10794757","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174521/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-length scaling of turbo-like code ensembles on the binary erasure channel","sourcePdf":"918jsac0609andriyan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064753S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5174509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5174509","articleId":"5174521","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5174522,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Graell I Amat","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Institut Telecom-Telecom Bretagne, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5174509/5174522/5174522-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandre Graell i Amat was born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, on January 28, 1976.

By using a proper labelling and adding a convolutional interleaver with block delay to such a STBC system, we achieve both lower error floors and lower thresholds.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5174509/05174524.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090813","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo coded multiple-antenna systems for near-capacity performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Turbo coded multiple-antenna systems for near-capacity performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174524/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174524/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10794765","volume":"27","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo coded multiple-antenna systems for near-capacity performance","sourcePdf":"954jsac0609ueng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107788S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5174509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5174509","articleId":"5174524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5174525,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa El-Khamy","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development, Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5174509/5174525/5174525-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mostafa El-Khamy received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 2006 from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena, USA where he also received an M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2003.

Most of the results in this area are based on experimental evidence and/or approximate analysis. The question of whether codes on sparse graphs can achieve the capacity of noisy channels with iterative decoding is still open, and has only been conclusively and positively answered for the binary erasure channel. On the other hand, codes on sparse graphs have been proven to achieve the capacity of memoryless, binary-input, output-symmetric channels with finite graphical complexity per information bit when maximum likelihood (ML) decoding is performed. In this paper, we consider transmission over finite-state channels (FSCs). We derive upper bounds on the average error probability of code ensembles with ML decoding. Based on these bounds we show that codes on sparse graphs can achieve the symmetric information rate (SIR) of FSCs, which is the maximum achievable rate with independently and uniformly distributed input sequences. In order to achieve rates beyond the SIR, we consider a simple quantization scheme that when applied to ensembles of codes on sparse graphs induces a Markov distribution on the transmitted sequence. By deriving average error probability bounds for these quantized code ensembles, we prove that they can achieve the information rates corresponding to the induced Markov distribution, and thus approach the FSC capacity.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5174509/05174526.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174509","startPage":"974","endPage":"984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity-achieving codes for finite-state channels with maximum-likelihood decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity-achieving codes for finite-state channels with maximum-likelihood decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10794760","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5174526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity-achieving codes for finite-state channels with maximum-likelihood decoding","sourcePdf":"974jsac0609bae.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121418S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5174509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5174509","articleId":"5174526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5174527,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5174509/5174527/5174527-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Zhang (S'09) received the B.E. degree in Information Engineering and the M.S. degree in Microelectronics, both from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China in 2004 and 2007 respectively.

Two new techniques are proposed, including parallel layered decoding architecture (PLDA) and critical path splitting. PLDA enables parallel processing for all layers by establishing dedicated message passing paths among them. The decoder avoids crossbar-based large interconnect network. Critical path splitting technique is based on articulate adjustment of the starting point of each layer to maximize the time intervals between adjacent layers, such that the critical path delay can be split into pipeline stages. Furthermore, min-sum and loosely coupled algorithms are employed for area efficiency. As a case study, a rate-1/2 2304-bit irregular LDPC decoder is implemented using ASIC design in 90 nm CMOS process. The decoder can achieve the maximum decoding throughput of 2.2 Gbps at 10 iterations.

The fractional distance is the minimum weight (with respect to lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-distance) of nonzero vertices of the fundamental polytope. The cutting polytope is defined based on redundant rows of the parity-check matrix. The redundant rows are codewords of the dual code not yet appearing as rows in the parity-check matrix. The cutting polytope plays a key role to eliminate unnecessary fractional vertices in the fundamental polytope. We propose a greedy algorithm and its efficient implementation based on the cutting-plane method. It has been confirmed that the fractional distance of some parity-check matrices are actually improved by using the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090818","startPage":"1005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5174509/05174529.pdf","endPage":"1012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174529/","displayDocTitle":"A cutting-plane method based on redundant rows for improving fractional distance","volume":"27","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5174529/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10794763","publicationDate":"August 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cutting-plane method based on redundant rows for improving fractional distance","sourcePdf":"996jsac0609miwa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080529S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5174509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5174509","articleId":"5174529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5174530,"authors":[{"name":"Eran Sharon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5174509/5174530/5174530-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eran Sharon was born in Israel, in 1976.

Schedules affect the rate of decoding convergence. New efficient generalized serial schedules are described and analyzed, exhibiting significantly faster convergence compared to previously known schedules. For the proposed schedules, combinatorial and probabilistic analysis is presented, explaining the fast convergence observed in simulations. Using it, LDPC ensembles for which significantly better convergence rates can be achieved are identified. Specific code constructions from lifted graphs are further proposed, efficiently supporting the schedules. Examples based on regular LDPC codes are provided, in which the schedules achieve convergence speedup factors of up to 6 in comparison with the flooding schedule. Higher speedup factors are predicted by the analysis for irregular codes.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5174509/05174530.pdf","startPage":"1013","endPage":"1024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence analysis of generalized serial message-passing schedules","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174530/","displayDocTitle":"Convergence analysis of generalized serial message-passing schedules","volume":"27","issue":"6","publicationDate":"August 2009","accessionNumber":"10794764","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174530/","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence analysis of generalized serial message-passing schedules","sourcePdf":"997jsac0609sharon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077721S","chronDate":"August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5174509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5174509","articleId":"5174530","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5174616,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The LSTC-CDMA system, based on a joint adaptive iterative detection and decoding algorithm, adaptively cancels Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and mitigates Multiple Access Interference (MAI). The Least Means Square (LMS) algorithm is used for both feed-forward filter and feedback filter in the adaptive detection. A Partially Filtered Gradient LMS (PFGLMS) algorithm is also proposed to improve the convergence speed of the adaptive detector. The performance results show that the receiver, based on PFGLMS algorithm, yields much faster convergence speed and tracking ability with a slightly increase in complexity. The proposed receiver is analyzed in the slow and fast Rayleigh fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/RIVF.2009.5174616","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE-RIVF International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE-RIVF International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174598/5174599/05174616.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RIVF.2009.5174616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Iterative Receiver for CDMA Systems in Rayleigh Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174616/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Iterative Receiver for CDMA Systems in Rayleigh Fading Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10801992","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174616/","conferenceDate":"13-17 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Iterative Receiver for CDMA Systems in Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Danang, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"PID889002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121052S","chronDate":"13-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174598","isNumber":"5174599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174598","xplore-issue":"5174599","articleId":"5174616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5174618,"authors":[{"name":"Viet Minh Nhat Vo","affiliation":["Faculty of Hospitality & Tourism, Hue University, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Viet Minh Nhat","lastName":"Vo","id":"38003301000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4566-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4568-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5174618","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174618","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Admission control","Asynchronous transfer mode","Quality of service","Bandwidth","Bit rate","Fluid flow measurement","Communication system control","Hopfield neural networks","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","neurocontrollers","quality of service","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","connection admission control","ATM network","flow controlling function","flow parameter","quality of registered service","CAC model","QoS"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RIVF.2009.5174618","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174598/5174599/05174618.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE-RIVF International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE-RIVF International Conference on Computing and Communication Technologies","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RIVF.2009.5174618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Application of Neural Networks in the Connection Admission Control of ATM Networks","abstract":"The connection admission control (CAC) in ATM networks is a flow controlling function that decides to allow or not a new connection joining in the network.

The autonomous helicopter used for tests is required to navigate from an initial to a final position in a partially known environment, to locate a landing area and to land on it. The algorithm proposed for the detection of safe landing areas is based on the analysis of optical flow and of mutual geometric position of different kinds of features, observed from different points of view. Vision allows estimating the position and velocity of a set of features with respect to the helicopter while the onboard, hierarchical, behavior-based control system autonomously guides the helicopter. Results, obtained using real data and a real helicopter in a outdoor scenario, show the appropriateness of the vision-based approach. It does not require any artificial landmark (e.g., helipad), is able to estimate correctly and autonomously safe landing areas and is quite robust to occlusions.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166725/5174665/05174705.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A single-camera feature-based vision system for helicopter autonomous landing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174705","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174705/","displayDocTitle":"A single-camera feature-based vision system for helicopter autonomous landing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10812189","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5174705/","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A single-camera feature-based vision system for helicopter autonomous landing","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"icar2009_submission_154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053325S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166725","isNumber":"5174665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166725","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5174665","articleId":"5174705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"GPS Gesellschaft","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5174709,"authors":[{"name":"Sven Lange","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Chemnitz University of Technology, Chemnitz, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Lange","id":"37950339100"},{"name":"Niko Sunderhauf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Chemnitz University of Technology, Chemnitz, Germany"],"firstName":"Niko","lastName":"Sunderhauf","id":"37563890800"},{"name":"Peter Protzel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Chemnitz University of Technology, Chemnitz, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Protzel","id":"37330206000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4855-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-8396-0035-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5174709","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":3525},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Position control","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Global Positioning System","Optical sensors","Payloads","Batteries","Magnetic sensors","Sensor fusion","Image motion analysis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","aircraft control","cascade control","helicopters","mobile robots","position control","remotely operated vehicles","robot vision","stability","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision based onboard approach","position control","autonomous multirotor UAV","GPS-denied environments","multirotor UAVs","autonomous landing","landing pad","vision based detection algorithm","3D-position estimation","cascaded controller structure","velocity stabilitization","position stabilitization","dedicated optical flow sensor"]}],"abstract":"We describe our work on multirotor UAVs and focus on our method for autonomous landing and position control.

Unlike previous biologically inspired sensors, it is based on new theories of the functional morphology of the fingertip skin features and the Meissner's Corpuscles mechanoreceptors pervading them, particularly in the encoding of tactile edge information. Through mimicking the layered macro-structure of fingertip skin the sensor is highly conformable and very sensitive, as well as a strong and practical gripping tool. The tactile sensor is composed of a thin flexible rubber skin with structural details emulating those of the glabrous epidermis. This encases a clear, highly compliant polymer melt blend with similar mechanical properties to the dermis and subcutaneous fat. A camera is used to track markers on the internal structural details of the rubber skin enabling remote, detailed, direct and sensitive detection of surface deflections. Initial results presented here show the design to be a very capable, highly sensitive sensor as well as a very practical, affordable and scalable robotic fingertip.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advanced Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5166725/5174665/05174720.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5174665","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a tactile sensor based on biologically inspired edge encoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174720","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of a tactile sensor based on biologically inspired edge encoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5174720/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10801861","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5174720/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a tactile sensor based on biologically inspired edge encoding","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"icar2009_submission_171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058945S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5166725","isNumber":"5174665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5166725","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5174665","articleId":"5174720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"GPS Gesellschaft","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5174736,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Schlegel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences, Ulm, Germany","Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences Ulm, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schlegel","id":"37333620900"},{"name":"Thomas Hassler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences Ulm, 89075, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Hassler","id":"37085935747"},{"name":"Alex Lotz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences, Ulm, Germany","Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences Ulm, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Lotz","id":"37990932100"},{"name":"Andreas Steck","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences, Ulm, Germany","Department of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences Ulm, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Steck","id":"37998052400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4855-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-8396-0035-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5174736","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":804},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5174736","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software systems","Robotics and automation","Service robots","Programming","Software engineering","Computer science","Design engineering","Computer industry","Automotive engineering","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","robot programming","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotic software systems","model-driven designs","industrial-strength service robotic systems","code-driven systems"]}],"abstract":"Engineering the software development process in robotics is one of the basic necessities towards industrial-strength service robotic systems.

Furthermore, this fosters reuse by separating robotics knowledge from short-cycled implementational technologies. Altogether, this is one but important step towards \u201cable\u201d robots.

Other properties of the objects relevant for grasping can also be automatically computed. Further, a human teacher can communicate with the system with multimodal techniques to bring the semantic information about the grasping to the system. The modeled information in this modeling center covers all the information a grasp planning needs. We have implemented a grasp planning system based on the grasp simulator ldquoGraspIt!rdquo to plan high quality grasps. The semantic information is represented as shape primitives, which are treated by the grasp planning as obstacles or must-touch regions of object to influence the resulted grasps.

Traditionally, systolic array was used to implement modular multiplication. It is not efficient because of data dependency between neighbor processing elements (PEs). In this paper, we propose a compact modular multiplication and addition unit (MMAU) specific for ECC by dividing an improved Montgomery modular multiplication (MMM) algorithm into three parts, mapping them correspondingly to a 3-stage pipelined circuit and adding a small amount of hardware to the third stage of the pipeline for implementing modular addition/subtraction without affecting the performance of MMM. The MMAU computes one modular multiplication and one modular addition/subtraction in every 3(n+7) clock cycles for n-bit operands. When the pipeline is fully utilized, the MMAU can generate a result at every n+7 cycles. The experimental results show that our scheme achieves a higher throughput with less resource compared with existed ones.","doi":"10.1109/IEEC.2009.115","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Information Engineering and Electronic Commerce","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Information Engineering and Electronic Commerce","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175054/5175055/05175172.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEC.2009.115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3-Stage Pipelined Large Integer Modular Arithmetic Unit for ECC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175172/","displayDocTitle":"A 3-Stage Pipelined Large Integer Modular Arithmetic Unit for ECC","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175172/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","conferenceDate":"16-17 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10824277","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3-Stage Pipelined Large Integer Modular Arithmetic Unit for ECC","confLoc":"Ternopil, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"3686a519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043613S","chronDate":"16-17 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175054","isNumber":"5175055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175054","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5175055","articleId":"5175172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5175177,"authors":[{"name":"Shanxin Qu","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shanxin","lastName":"Qu","id":"38253492900"},{"name":"Guochu Shou","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guochu","lastName":"Shou","id":"37396578900"},{"name":"Yihong Hu","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yihong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37403245800"},{"name":"Zhigang Guo","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37397439800"},{"name":"Zongjue Qian","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zongjue","lastName":"Qian","id":"38255480800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3686-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5175177","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1082},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175177","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Polynomials","Clocks","Galois fields","Electronic commerce","Registers","Delay","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AES cipher processor","pipelined AES architecture","CTR mode","register","byte transformation","inner process order","data stream direction","Xilinx Foundation ISEtrade 10.1 FPGA design tool","clock frequency","resource efficiency","advanced encryption standard","bit rate 73.737 Gbit/s","frequency 576.07 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","FPGA","Pipelined","GF(2)","Throughput"]}],"abstract":"The FPGA-based high throughput 128 bits AES cipher processor is proposed in this paper.

The reconstructed signal is a linear combination of reconstruction functions, and the main task is to compute the coefficients from the measurements. This generally involves an inversion of the cross-correlation matrix between the sampling functions and the reconstruction functions. We show that the coefficients are computed efficiently using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) when sampling is shift-invariant and when the reconstruction functions are shift-invariant functions, Fourier basis functions, or Fourier cosine basis functions. Because of the DFT, the proposed methods do not require matrix inversion computation; rather these methods make it possible to obtain the coefficients with an O(N log N) computation, where N stands for the number of samples. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments using an ECG signal.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Signal reconstruction","Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal sampling","Electrocardiography","Signal processing","Signal generators","Bridges","Deconvolution","Fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consistent signal sampling","signal reconstruction","cross-correlation matrix inversion","discrete Fourier transform","DFT","shift-invariant function","Fourier basis function","Fourier cosine basis function","ECG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consistency","discrete Fourier transforms","generalized sampling","sampling methods","shift-invariant sampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2028451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5226765/05175250.pdf","startPage":"1023","endPage":"1026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2028451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistent Sampling and Efficient Signal Reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Consistent Sampling and Efficient Signal Reconstruction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175250/","volume":"16","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175250/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10847013","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistent Sampling and Efficient Signal Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"16lsp12-ahirabayashi-2028451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043037S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5226765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5226765","articleId":"5175250","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5175256,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Shibayama","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shibayama","id":"37284207700"},{"name":"Ryoji Ando","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoji","lastName":"Ando","id":"37587467100"},{"name":"Junji Yamauchi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Yamauchi","id":"37267404500"},{"name":"Hisamatsu Nakano","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisamatsu","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37277793100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5175256","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Periodic structures","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Boundary conditions","Photonic band gap","Size control","Degradation","Error correction","Maxwell equations","Two dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["periodic structures","finite-difference time-domain method","locally one-dimensional scheme","Sherman-Morrison formula","cyclic matrix problem","periodic boundary condition","photonic band-gap structure","alternating-direction implicit","dispersion control parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating-direction implicit (ADI) scheme","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","periodic structure"]}],"abstract":"An efficient finite-difference time-domain method based on the locally one-dimensional scheme (LOD-FDTD) is developed for the analysis of periodic structures.

As a result, the computational time is reduced to sime 50% of that of the traditional explicit FDTD while maintaining acceptable numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2009.2028448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4808186/05175256.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2009.2028448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808186","startPage":"890","endPage":"893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LOD-FDTD Method for the Analysis of Periodic Structures at Normal Incidence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An LOD-FDTD Method for the Analysis of Periodic Structures at Normal Incidence","chronOrPublicationDate":"2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175256/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","publicationDate":"2009","accessionNumber":"10841871","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5175256/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LOD-FDTD Method for the Analysis of Periodic Structures at Normal Incidence","sourcePdf":"lawp-jshibayama-2028448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09683S","chronDate":"2009","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4808186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4808186","articleId":"5175256","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175257,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Zhang","affiliation":["Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292465700"},{"name":"Cyril Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Leung","id":"37279072600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5175257","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Signal processing","Filling","Additive white noise","Downlink","Channel state information","Resource management","Frequency division multiplexing","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subchannel power-loading","multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","discrete bit-loading","medium-access control","resource-allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit loading","multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)","power allocation","water filling"]}],"abstract":"Achievable bit rates for a number of continuous and discrete bit-loading schemes for multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are studied.

The forward, reverse, and parallel TNTB models are introduced. These models enable a more general modeling of nonlinear distortions and memory effects in comparison with previously reported behavioural models. The models' performance is assessed experimentally for a high power Doherty amplifier driven by multi-carrier WCDMA signals. The modeling and predistortion results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models when compared to the well established memory polynomials. Indeed, the proposed models lead to the same performance as memory polynomial models while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 50%. Definitely, only 24 parameters were required to accurately model and linearize a highly nonlinear Doherty power amplifier driven by a 20 MHz wide multi-carrier signal. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the lowest complexity model/digital predistorter reported for similar context.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5196837/05175262.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2024848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2024848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5196837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Twin Nonlinear Two-Box Models for Power Amplifiers and Transmitters Exhibiting Memory Effects With Application to Digital Predistortion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Transmitters","Predistortion","Context modeling","Nonlinear distortion","High power amplifiers","Polynomials","Finite impulse response filter","Bandwidth","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","nonlinear distortion","power amplifiers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["twin nonlinear two-box models","digital predistortion","power transmitters","memory effects","nonlinear distortions","high power Doherty amplifier","multi-carrier WCDMA","polynomials","frequency 20 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Behavioural modeling","digital predistortion","memory effects","nonlinearity","power amplifier","3G"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Twin Nonlinear Two-Box Models for Power Amplifiers and Transmitters Exhibiting Memory Effects With Application to Digital Predistortion","volume":"19","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5175262/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10806561","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Twin Nonlinear Two-Box Models for Power Amplifiers and Transmitters Exhibiting Memory Effects With Application to Digital Predistortion","sourcePdf":"lmwc-hammi-2024848.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035793S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5196837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5196837","articleId":"5175262","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175267,"authors":[{"name":"Mike Novey","affiliation":["University of Maryland Baltimore County, Catonsville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Novey","id":"37565798600"},{"name":"Tulay Adali","affiliation":["University of Maryland Baltimore County, Catonsville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Tulay","lastName":"Adali","id":"37284803700"},{"name":"Anindya Roy","affiliation":["University of Maryland Baltimore County, Catonsville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Anindya","lastName":"Roy","id":"37675796900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5175267","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":733},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","Testing","Signal processing algorithms","Random variables","Signal processing","Covariance matrix","Radar detection","Radar imaging","Statistics","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","maximum likelihood estimation","random processes","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussianity detection","complex generalized gaussian distribution","statistical property","complex-valued signal","signal processing application","generalized likelihood ratio test","complex random variable"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex-valued signal processing","detection","noncircularity"]}],"abstract":"Knowing the statistical properties of a complex-valued signal is important in many signal processing applications by providing the necessary information for choosing the appropriate algorithm.

These tests can be combined to statistically determine if a complex random variable is, the often assumed, circular Gaussian.

Together with proper nonlinear active circuitry, such a high-order resonator realizes a multi-mode oscillator covering a wide frequency range. Compared with conventional switched-resonator-based approaches that consume the same chip area, the proposed coupled-inductor-based resonator results in larger quality-factor, and hence, lower oscillator phase noise. In the proposed multi-mode oscillator that uses the multi-port coupled inductors, mode switching is achieved using independent active cores without using lossy switches in the resonator path. The behavior of the multi-mode resonator as a multi-port network in an oscillator, design trade-offs, and switching transient response of the multi-mode oscillator have been studied analytically. As a proof of concept, an integrated voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with a 1.28-6.06 GHz tuning range is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 mum CMOS technology. The triple-mode VCO uses a sixth-order resonator based on three coupled inductors with a compact common-centric layout. Depending on the oscillation frequency, the VCO current consumption is automatically adjusted from 2.9 to 6.1 mA to achieve a low phase noise throughout the frequency range. The measured phase noises at 1 MHz offset from carrier frequencies of 1.76, 2.26, 3.3, 4.5, and 5.6 GHz are -119.3 , -120.15 , -118.1 , -117 , and -113.5 dBc/Hz , respectively.

Carbon electrodes are supposed to be chemically and electrochemically inert, and the electrostatic nature of the charge-storage mechanism is highly reversible. These properties should assure that SCs have an infinite shelf life. However, in practice, SC cells exhibit performance fading when they are used for months. The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance fading of SCs in two types of tests. The first accelerated test is the calendar life test, which evaluates cell degradation when cells are used at elevated voltages and temperatures; these degradations are observed in cells during rest periods. The second test is the power cycling test, which corresponds to degradations during the actual use of SCs as peak power sources in hybrid electric applications. In this paper, we use an impedance model to monitor changes in cell behavior. This analytical impedance model is based not only on physical quantities, such as double-layer capacitance, specific area, and electrolyte conductivity, but on elementary electrode dispersion as well. This model is validated in the frequency domain using the initial state of the tested SC for different temperature and voltage configurations. Then, we present and specify two types of tests. A periodic characterization based on impedance spectroscopy is done to quantify impedance changes during the ageing tests. The obtained results confirm that the impedance real part is increasing and that the capacitance is decreasing during the two ageing tests; however, the way they change is different. Indeed, the shape of the impedance real part is conserved in the calendar life test, whereas it is distorted in the power cycling test. This difference will be explained in terms of the evolution of the impedance model parameters. This paper confirms that the two ageing tests affect the SC performances differently.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2028431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5277109/05175279.pdf","startPage":"3917","endPage":"3929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2028431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Calendar Life and Cycling Ageing on Supercapacitor Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175279/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Calendar Life and Cycling Ageing on Supercapacitor Performance","volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10903082","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175279/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Calendar Life and Cycling Ageing on Supercapacitor Performance","sourcePdf":"tvt-elbrouji-2028431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067092S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5277109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5277109","articleId":"5175279","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175281,"authors":[{"name":"Erdem S Erdogan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5471724/5175281/5175281-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erdem S.

Slave-side arbitration is different from master-side arbitration in terms of request and grant signals since, in the former, the master merely starts a burst transaction and waits for the slave response to proceed to the next transfer. Therefore, in the former, the unit of arbitration can be a transaction or a transfer. However, the ML-AHB busmatrix of ARM offers only transfer-based fixed-priority and round-robin arbitration schemes. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of a flexible arbiter for the ML-AHB busmatrix to support three priority policies-fixed priority, round robin, and dynamic priority-and three data multiplexing modes-transfer, transaction, and desired transfer length. In total, there are nine possible arbitration schemes. The proposed arbiter, which is self-motivated (SM), selects one of the nine possible arbitration schemes based upon the priority-level notifications and the desired transfer length from the masters so that arbitration leads to the maximum performance. Experimental results show that, although the area overhead of the proposed SM arbitration scheme is 9%-25% larger than those of the other arbitration schemes, our arbiter improves the throughput by 14%-62% compared to other schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a Self-Motivated Arbitration Scheme for the Multilayer AHB Busmatrix","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2015665","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5453312/05175282.pdf","startPage":"818","endPage":"830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2015665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5453312","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175282/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a Self-Motivated Arbitration Scheme for the Multilayer AHB Busmatrix","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5175282/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11260236","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a Self-Motivated Arbitration Scheme for the Multilayer AHB Busmatrix","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-hwang-2015665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177323S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5453312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5453312","articleId":"5175282","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175284,"authors":[{"name":"Gun Rae Cho","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gun Rae","lastName":"Cho","id":"37291608700"},{"name":"Pyung Hun Chang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Pyung Hun","lastName":"Chang","id":"37271068900"},{"name":"Sang Hyun Park","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Hyun","lastName":"Park","id":"37559865400"},{"name":"Maolin Jin","affiliation":["Research Institute of Industrial Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Maolin","lastName":"Jin","id":"37292060100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"5175284","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":905},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Friction","Manipulator dynamics","Robust stability","Control systems","Sliding mode control","Stability analysis","Robot control","Robustness","Mechanical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","friction","manipulator dynamics","nonlinear control systems","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust tracking problem","nonlinear robot manipulator friction dynamics","time-delay control","internal model","compensator","stability","positive attribute"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Friction","internal model control (IMC)","robot manipulator","robust tracking control","time-delay control (TDC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175284","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2008.2007650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2008.2007650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5284441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5284441/05175284.pdf","startPage":"1406","endPage":"1414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Tracking Under Nonlinear Friction Using Time-Delay Control With Internal Model","abstract":"In this paper, the robustness problem in time-delay control (TDC) is considered in the presence of the nonlinear friction dynamics of robot manipulators.

In a recent paper, a methodology to design such controllers ensuring asymptotic stability was proposed. The technique relied on the basic fact that if an affine system can be rendered passive with a constant control, then it is stabilizable with a PI. A structural condition was imposed then on the power converter to satisfy the former property with a passive output generated as a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">linear</i>\n combination of the states. This condition is technical and has no clear physical interpretation. In this brief this result is extended in three directions: first, the aforementioned condition is removed; second, a larger class of converters (with switching external sources) is considered; third, the load resistance is assumed unknown and an adaptive PI controller (with three different estimators) is proposed. Instrumental to establish the result is the proof that the nonlinear incremental model of power converters defines a passive map-a property first observed by Sanders and Verghese in the early 1990's. The methodology is applied to the problem of power factor compensation of a 3-phase voltage source rectifier, already considered in our previous paper, which is revisited from the incremental passivity perspective yielding simpler proofs. Also, a stable adaptive PI is designed for the output voltage regulation of a quadratic boost converter.

This paper describes a linear, time-varying (LTV) model of clock comparators that can accurately predict the decision error probability without resorting to more general stochastic system models. The LTV analysis framework in conjunction with the linear, periodically time-varying (LPTV) simulation algorithms available from RF circuit simulators can provide insights into the intrinsic sampling and decision operations of clock comparators and the major contribution sources to random decision errors. Two comparators are simulated and compared with laboratory measurements. A 90-nm CMOS comparator is measured to have an equivalent input-referred random noise of 0.73 mVrms for dc inputs, matching simulation results with a short channel excess noise factor \u00bf = 2.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2009.2028449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2009.2028449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5200688/05175291.pdf","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and Analysis of Random Decision Errors in Clocked Comparators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and Analysis of Random Decision Errors in Clocked Comparators","volume":"56","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175291/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10878324","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175291/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and Analysis of Random Decision Errors in Clocked Comparators","sourcePdf":"56tcsi08-jkim-2028449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111422S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5200688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5200688","articleId":"5175291","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5175292,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshiaki Kuwata","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA","Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/5224023/5175292/5175292-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yoshiaki Kuwata received the B.Eng. degree from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2001, and the S.M. and Ph.D. degrees in aeronautics and astronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Boston, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.","In 2007, he worked on the DARPA Urban Challenge as a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT.

The expression shows how the harmonic frequencies and the zero directions may affect the performance, and further, how a performance degradation may result under the available partial information.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2009.2023969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5191265/05175297.pdf","startPage":"2001","endPage":"2006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2009.2023969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Average Performance Limit of MIMO Systems in Tracking Multi-Sinusoids With Partial Signal Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175297/","displayDocTitle":"An Average Performance Limit of MIMO Systems in Tracking Multi-Sinusoids With Partial Signal Information","volume":"54","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10805993","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175297/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Average Performance Limit of MIMO Systems in Tracking Multi-Sinusoids With Partial Signal Information","sourcePdf":"tac-su-2023969.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062497S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5191265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5191265","articleId":"5175297","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175322,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Hwan You","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Hwan","lastName":"You","id":"37269122600"},{"name":"JoonBeom Kim","affiliation":["Nortel Networks Limited, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"JoonBeom","lastName":"Kim","id":"37986457000"},{"name":"Hyoung-Kyu Song","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Kyu","lastName":"Song","id":"37270117500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"5175322","dbTime":"67 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":660},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","Digital video broadcasting","Frequency estimation","OFDM","Sampling methods","Digital audio broadcasting","Clocks","Degradation","Robustness","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","OFDM modulation","receivers","signal sampling","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synchronization","OFDM-based DVB receivers","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","residual frequency offset","sampling clock frequency offset","digital video broadcasting system","SFO estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continual pilot","digital video broadcasting","OFDM","residual frequency offset","sampling frequency offset","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"After coarse synchronization in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, there might still be a residual frequency offset (RFO) and a sampling clock frequency offset (SFO), which seriously degrade the performance of the systems. This paper proposes a simple way of jointly estimating the RFO and SFO by using a continual pilot (CP) defined in an OFDM-based digital video broadcasting (DVB) system. For deriving an unbiased joint RFO and SFO estimator in the current DVB system, a CP subset is selected to simultaneously remove the effect of RFO and SFO. We can observe by simulation that the proposed frequency estimator endowed with a properly selected CP subset is unbiased and performs robustly.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2009.2027400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5210245/05175322.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2009.2027400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-Assisted Fine Frequency Synchronization for OFDM-Based DVB Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175322/","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-Assisted Fine Frequency Synchronization for OFDM-Based DVB Receivers","volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10840319","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175322/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-Assisted Fine Frequency Synchronization for OFDM-Based DVB Receivers","sourcePdf":"tbc-you-2027400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084892S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5210245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5210245","articleId":"5175322","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175324,"authors":[{"name":"Zhan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37629367000"},{"name":"Leonard MacEachern","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"MacEachern","id":"37269976500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"5175324","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1410},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Impedance matching","Transformers","Chebyshev approximation","Polynomials","Transfer functions","Band pass filters","Microwave filters","Transmission lines","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","band-pass filters","Chebyshev approximation","microwave filters","printed circuits","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband uncompensated Marchand baluns","wideband compensated Marchand baluns","stepped impedance transformers","bandpass response","Chebyshev polynomials","transfer function dc poles","transmission line elements","two-sided printed circuit board","microwave filter design approaches","frequency 1 GHz to 7.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Balun","bandpass filter","Chebyshev","equal ripple","Marchand","microwave filter","ultra-wideband"]}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> This paper presents a design approach for wideband compensated and uncompensated Marchand baluns with stepped-impedance transformers. In order to obtain an equal-ripple bandpass response, conventional Chebyshev polynomials are modified to compensate the effect of the transfer function's dc poles. Unlike the available microwave filter design approaches, which usually require redundant elements, this approach leads to an optimum design by using the minimum number of equal length transmission line elements. Based on this design approach, both compensated and uncompensated Marchand baluns are studied. It is found that increasing difficulty arises when implementing a large bandwidth balun using the widely adopted compensated balun structure. Hence, the uncompensated balun structure becomes a better choice. To validate the proposed design approach, an uncompensated balun is designed on a standard two-sided printed circuit board. The measured results indicate that a return loss greater than 20 dB can be observed from 1 to 7.5 GHz. The phase imbalance is less than 4\u00b0 and the amplitude is less than 0.5 dB from dc to 7.2 GHz. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5200722/05175324.pdf","startPage":"2064","endPage":"2071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2025463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200722","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Design of Wideband Compensated and Uncompensated Marchand Baluns With Step Transformers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Design of Wideband Compensated and Uncompensated Marchand Baluns With Step Transformers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","volume":"57","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816577","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Design of Wideband Compensated and Uncompensated Marchand Baluns With Step Transformers","sourcePdf":"57tmtt08-lmaceachern-2025463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047553S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","isNumber":"5200722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"15","articleId":"5175324","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5175325,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhou","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37397626400"},{"name":"Jacek M.

The objective is to enable a building-management system to be used for forecasting and detection of abnormal energy use. First, an outlier-detection method is proposed to identify abnormally high or low energy use in a building. Then a canonical variate analysis is employed to describe latent variables of daily electricity-consumption profiles, which can be used to group the data sets into different clusters. Finally, a simple classifier is used to predict the daily electricity-consumption profiles. A case study, based on a mixed-use environment, was studied. The results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper can be used in conjunction with a building-management system to identify abnormal utility consumption and notify building operators in real time.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5599338/05175339.pdf","startPage":"3639","endPage":"3644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2027926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2027926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Energy Consumption in Buildings With Outlier Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Load forecasting","Predictive models","Energy management","Intelligent structures","Data analysis","Energy efficiency","Permission","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building management systems","energy consumption","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buildings energy consumption","intelligent data analysis method","electricity consumption","building management system","energy usage forecasting","energy usage detection","canonical variate analysis","data sets","cluster analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Canonical variate analysis (CVA)","electricity data","energy management","modeling","outlier detection","prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Classification of Energy Consumption in Buildings With Outlier Detection","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5175339/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11579593","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Energy Consumption in Buildings With Outlier Detection","sourcePdf":"tie-li-2027926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080961S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5599338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5599338","articleId":"5175339","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175340,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Wu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5280584/5175340/5175340-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Wu was born on July 13, 1987, in Guangdong, China.

By the model, the designers' experience is no longer very important and the shape of the antenna is more reasonable than that obtained by traditional grid division.

The MC replaces the back-to-back converters conventionally used to control a DFIG. The MC is operated with close-to-unity power factor at the grid side. Stability issues related to the operation of the MC in the proposed WECS are discussed. A small signal model is used to investigate the dynamic performance of the two control arrangements discussed in this paper. Experimental results, obtained with a 4-kW prototype, are presented and fully discussed in this paper.

The system could suffer both matched and mismatched uncertainties from a variety of sources such as unmodeled magnetic forces due to flux leakage and parametric uncertainties due to manufacturing and assembly errors. The system represents an interesting example that is not in the standard strict feedback form, but allows for the backstepping design. Through a backstepping procedure, two stages of integral sliding-mode control (ISMC) are integrated to form a robust controller. The first stage is a robust controller for the current-controlled three-pole AMB system, which is a nonaffine nonlinear system. It is designed by the feedback linearization approach incorporated with the ISMC. The overall robust stabilizing controller is verified both numerically and experimentally.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Control of a Voltage-Controlled Three-Pole Active Magnetic Bearing System","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2009.2027015","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/5441215/05175346.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2009.2027015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175346/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust Control of a Voltage-Controlled Three-Pole Active Magnetic Bearing System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5175346/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11208170","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Control of a Voltage-Controlled Three-Pole Active Magnetic Bearing System","sourcePdf":"tmech-chen-2027015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050422S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"5441215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5441215","articleId":"5175346","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175353,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Dixon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5410131/5175353/5175353-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juan Dixon (M'90\u2013SM'95) was born in Santiago, Chile.

These batteries are cheaper than Li-ion cells and have a comparable specific energy (in watt-hours per kilogram), but one important limitation is their poor specific power (in watts per kilogram). The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate experimentally that the combination of ZEBRA batteries and ultracapacitors (UCAPs) can solve the lack of specific power, allowing an excellent performance in both acceleration and regenerative braking in an EV. The UCAP system was connected to the ZEBRA battery and to the traction inverter through a buck-boost-type dc-dc converter, which manages the energy flow with the help of DSP controllers. The vehicle uses a brushless dc motor with a nominal power of 32 kW and a peak power of 53 kW. The control system measures and stores the following parameters: battery voltage, car speed to adjust the energy stored in the UCAPs, instantaneous currents in both terminals (battery and UCAPs), and present voltage of the UCAP. The increase in range with UCAPs results in more than 16% in city tests, where the application of this type of vehicle is being oriented. The results also show that this alternative is cheaper than Li-ion powered electric cars.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5410131/05175353.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2027920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2027920","startPage":"943","endPage":"949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric Vehicle Using a Combination of Ultracapacitors and ZEBRA Battery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175353/","displayDocTitle":"Electric Vehicle Using a Combination of Ultracapacitors and ZEBRA Battery","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175353/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11119938","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric Vehicle Using a Combination of Ultracapacitors and ZEBRA Battery","sourcePdf":"tie-dixon-2027920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059516S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5410131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5410131","articleId":"5175353","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5175357,"authors":[{"name":"Jingang Yi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and AeroSpace Engineering, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/5277110/5175357/5175357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingang Yi (S'99\u2013M'02\u2013SM'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1993, the M.Eng. degree in precision instruments from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1996, and the M.A. degree in mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2001 and 2002, respectively.","From May 2002 to January 2005, he was with Lam Research Corporation, Fremont, CA, as a Member of the Technical Staff.

Understanding the kinematics and dynamics of such a robotic platform is, however, challenging due to the complex wheel/ground interactions and kinematic constraints. In this paper, we develop a kinematic modeling scheme to analyze the skid-steered mobile robot. Based on the analysis of the kinematics of the skid-steered mobile robot, we reveal the underlying geometric and kinematic relationships between the wheel slips and locations of the instantaneous rotation centers. As an application example, we also present how to utilize the modeling and analysis for robot positioning and wheel slip estimation using only low-cost strapdown inertial measurement units. The robot positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) design that incorporates the kinematic constraints for accuracy enhancement. The performance of the EKF-based positioning and wheel slip-estimation scheme are also presented. The estimation methodology is tested and validated experimentally on a robotic test bed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5277110/05175357.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1097","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2009.2026506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2009.2026506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5277110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kinematic Modeling and Analysis of Skid-Steered Mobile Robots With Applications to Low-Cost Inertial-Measurement-Unit-Based Motion Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Kinematic Modeling and Analysis of Skid-Steered Mobile Robots With Applications to Low-Cost Inertial-Measurement-Unit-Based Motion Estimation","htmlLink":"/document/5175357/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10894921","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kinematic Modeling and Analysis of Skid-Steered Mobile Robots With Applications to Low-Cost Inertial-Measurement-Unit-Based Motion Estimation","sourcePdf":"tro-yi-2026506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089352S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5277110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"5277110","articleId":"5175357","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-21"},{"_id":5175360,"authors":[{"name":"Han Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5286817/5175360/5175360-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Han Cai received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2001, and the M.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from Beijing University, China, in 2004.","Since 2005, she has been at North Carolina State University, Raleigh, as a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

It is typically assumed to be exponentially distributed in many performance studies of MANET or numerically shown to be exponentially distributed under most existing mobility models in the literature. However, recent empirical results show otherwise: The intermeeting time distribution, in fact, follows a power-law. This outright discrepancy potentially undermines our understanding of the performance tradeoffs in MANET obtained under the exponential distribution of the intermeeting time and, thus, calls for further study on the power-law intermeeting time including its fundamental cause, mobility modeling, and its effect. In this paper, we rigorously prove that a finite domain, on which most of the current mobility models are defined, plays an important role in creating the exponential tail of the intermeeting time. We also prove that by simply removing the boundary in a simple two-dimensional isotropic random walk model, we are able to obtain the empirically observed power-law decay of the intermeeting time. We then discuss the relationship between the size of the boundary and the relevant timescale of the network scenario under consideration. Our results thus provide guidelines on the mobility modeling with power-law intermeeting time distribution, new protocols including packet-forwarding algorithms, as well as their performance analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2008.2011734","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5286817/05175360.pdf","startPage":"1578","endPage":"1591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2008.2011734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crossing Over the Bounded Domain: From Exponential to Power-Law Intermeeting Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175360/","displayDocTitle":"Crossing Over the Bounded Domain: From Exponential to Power-Law Intermeeting Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918119","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175360/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crossing Over the Bounded Domain: From Exponential to Power-Law Intermeeting Time in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-eun-2011734.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136652S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5286817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5286817","articleId":"5175360","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175365,"authors":[{"name":"Yuki Yokokura","affiliation":["Department of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/5175365/5175365-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuki Yokokura (S'08) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.","Since 2009, he has been with the Department of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.

Non-zero Schottky barrier heights also offer some performance improvement for the same reason, but high-k gate-sidewall spacers are a much better alternative. Ultimately, DSDT and short channel effects will limit the scaling of the (off -state) electrical channel length, which is determined by the source-to-drain contact spacing and fringing field effects such as gate sidewall coupling and silicide gating. Although the physical gate length can be scaled below 3 nm with little DSDT-induced performance degradation, the lower limit for source-to-drain contact spacing is projected to be ~ 11 nm.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2026318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5208517/05175375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2026318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208517","startPage":"2016","endPage":"2026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dopant-Segregated Schottky Source/Drain Double-Gate MOSFET Design in the Direct Source-to-Drain Tunneling Regime","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dopant-Segregated Schottky Source/Drain Double-Gate MOSFET Design in the Direct Source-to-Drain Tunneling Regime","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828901","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5175375/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dopant-Segregated Schottky Source/Drain Double-Gate MOSFET Design in the Direct Source-to-Drain Tunneling Regime","sourcePdf":"ted-vega-2026318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102573S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5208517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5208517","articleId":"5175375","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175382,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Jin Moon","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory, Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Jin","lastName":"Moon","id":"37531937600"},{"name":"Yong-Seong Roh","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory, Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Seong","lastName":"Roh","id":"37534708700"},{"name":"Chan-Young Jeong","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory, Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chan-Young","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37286390700"},{"name":"Changsik Yoo","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits Laboratory, Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changsik","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37270259700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5175382","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2465},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage-controlled oscillators","Capacitors","Frequency","CMOS technology","Phase locked loops","Tuning","Phase noise","Varactors","Moon","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS voltage-controlled oscillator","VCO-gain variation","serial capacitor bank","CMOS RF technology","frequency 4.39 GHz to 5.26 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","LC-tank","VCO gain (KVCO)","voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)","wide tuning range"]}],"abstract":"A wide band CMOS LC-tank voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with small VCO gain (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">KVCO</i>\n) variation was developed.

The performance of a rectangular patch antenna array on a metamaterial substrate was studied relative to a similar array constructed on a conventional FR4 substrate. Differently spaced arrays were analytically compared using array correlation coefficients and mean effective gain as performance metrics. Achievable channel capacity were obtained through channel measurements made on a MIMO testbed. While results show that arrays on conventional FR4 substrates have higher capacity due to gain and efficiency factors, arrays can be made smaller, and have less mutual coupling and correlation coefficients, when using a metamaterial substrate, but the antenna built on the metamaterial substrate can be made more efficient through the use of better host materials. This was reflected in the analysis of both antenna arrays normalized to remove efficiency and gain differences where they showed similar performances. Hence, metamaterial substrates are a cost-effective solution when antenna miniaturization is a key design criteria compared to conventional substrates that achieve the same miniaturization factor without significantly sacrificing performance.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2028638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280584/05175385.pdf","startPage":"3283","endPage":"3292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2028638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metamaterial-Substrate Antenna Array for MIMO Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175385/","displayDocTitle":"Metamaterial-Substrate Antenna Array for MIMO Communication System","volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917797","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175385/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metamaterial-Substrate Antenna Array for MIMO Communication System","sourcePdf":"57tap10-pmookiah-2028638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110233S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5280584","articleId":"5175385","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175386,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyi Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xinyi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37405880200"},{"name":"Koen Mouthaan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Koen","lastName":"Mouthaan","id":"37295313100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5175386","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":858},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Frequency","Impedance","Phase shifters","Band pass filters","Shunt (electrical)","Inductors","Capacitors","Design optimization","Fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","microwave filters","microwave phase shifters","resonators","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shifting network","90deg phase shift","180deg phase shift","theoretical bandwidth","phase errors","bandpass filter","LC resonator","shunt quarter-wavelength transmission lines","reference transmission lines","return losses","octave bandwidth","frequency 1 GHz to 3 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandpass filter (BPF)","octave-bandwidth","phase error","phase shifter","resonator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175386","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2024837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","abstract":"A new phase shifting network for both 180deg and 90deg phase shift with small phase errors over an octave bandwidth is presented.

Using experimental results, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method in ship detection.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2009.2024224","startPage":"723","endPage":"727","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5278412/05175395.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2009.2024224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ship Detection Using Polarization Cross-Entropy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Polarization","Radar detection","Matrix decomposition","Radar scattering","Oceans","Detectors","Entropy","Exponential distribution","Earth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","electromagnetic wave polarisation","entropy","exponential distribution","marine radar","radar polarimetry","ships","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization cross-entropy","eigendecomposition","polarimetric coherence matrix","ocean region","exponential distribution","false-alarm-rate ship-detection method","approximation theory","polarimetric SAR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-entropy","detection","polarization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Ship Detection Using Polarization Cross-Entropy","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5175395/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10940307","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ship Detection Using Polarization Cross-Entropy","sourcePdf":"lgrs-chen-2024224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048341S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5278412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5278412","articleId":"5175395","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":5175401,"authors":[{"name":"Gouhei Tanaka","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5230374/5175401/5175401-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gouhei Tanaka received the B.E. degree in mathematical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in complexity science from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","Currently, he is a Research Associate at the Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo.

Numerical experiments show that both modifications to the complex-valued activation function bring about improvements in network performance for a multistate associative memory. The advantage of the proposed networks over the complex-valued Hopfield networks with the multilevel step function is more outstanding when a complex-valued neuron represents a larger number of multivalued states.

In the proposed VII framework, the vehicle onboard equipment and roadside units (RSUs) collaboratively work, supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm, to determine the occurrence and characteristics of an incident. Two AI paradigms are examined: 1) support vector machines (SVMs) and 2) artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each RSU then assesses the traffic condition based on the information from multiple vehicles traveling on its supervised highway segment. As a case study, this paper developed a model of the VII-SVM framework and evaluated its performance in a microscopic traffic simulation environment for a highway network in Spartanburg, SC. The performance of the VII-SVM was compared with the performance of the corresponding VII-ANN framework, and both frameworks were found to be capable of classifying the travel experience using the kinetic data generated by each vehicle. The performance of the VII-SVM framework, in terms of its detection rate, false-alarm rate, and detection times, was also found to be superior to a baseline California-type incident-detection algorithm. Moreover, the framework provided additional information, including an estimate of the incident location and the likely number of lanes blocked, which will be helpful for implementing an appropriate response strategy. The proposed VII-AI framework thus provides a reliable alternative to traditional traffic sensors in assessing traffic conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2009.2026673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5338639/05175403.pdf","startPage":"615","endPage":"627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2009.2026673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Highway Traffic Condition Assessment Framework Using Vehicle\u2013Infrastructure Integration (VII) With Artificial Intelligence (AI)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Highway Traffic Condition Assessment Framework Using Vehicle\u2013Infrastructure Integration (VII) With Artificial Intelligence (AI)","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10998994","htmlLink":"/document/5175403/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Highway Traffic Condition Assessment Framework Using Vehicle\u2013Infrastructure Integration (VII) With Artificial Intelligence (AI)","sourcePdf":"tits-chowdhury-2026673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102178S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5338639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5338639","articleId":"5175403","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5175404,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhao","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5483249/5175404/5175404-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Zhao was born in Jiangxi Province, China, in 1977.

The model carefully takes into consideration the trapping/detrapping processes in the nitride, the limited number of traps available for charge storage, and their spatial and energetic distribution. Results are in good agreement with experimental data on TANOS devices with different gate-stack compositions, considering a quite extended range of gate biases and times. The reduced gate-bias sensitivity of the programming transients with respect to the floating-gate cell is explained in terms of a finite number of nitride traps and a thinner extension of the nitride trapping region as the gate bias is increased. The model represents a valid contribution for the investigation of the achievable performances of the TANOS technology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5208517/05175414.pdf","startPage":"2008","endPage":"2015","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2026315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2026315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Modeling for Programming of TANOS Memories in the Fowler\u2013Nordheim Regime","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Transient analysis","Logic gates","Tunneling","Numerical models","Electron traps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical modeling","TANOS memories","Fowler-Nordheim regime","uniform tunneling regime","bottom-oxide layer","flash memories","semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flash memories","semiconductor device modeling","TANOS memories","tunneling program/erase (P/E)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Physical Modeling for Programming of TANOS Memories in the Fowler\u2013Nordheim Regime","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5175414/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828903","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Modeling for Programming of TANOS Memories in the Fowler\u2013Nordheim Regime","sourcePdf":"ted-compagnoni-2026315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107704S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5208517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5208517","articleId":"5175414","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175416,"authors":[{"name":"Karim El Shabrawy","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/5427239/5175416/5175416-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Karim El Shabrawy (S\u201907) received the M.Eng. degree (Hons.) in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K. He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering at the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K.","He is currently the Chairman of the IEEE Student Branch, University of Southampton.

In this paper, we apply a statistical approach in predicting the SWCNT bandgap and effective mass variation for typical uncertainties associated with the geometrical structure. This is first carried out by proposing a simulation-efficient analytical model that evaluates the bandgap (Eg) of an isolated SWCNT with a specified diameter (d) and chirality (\u00bf). Similarly, we develop an SWCNT effective mass model, which is applicable to CNTs of any chirality and diameters >1 nm.

The power losses associated with the parasitics of on-chip inductors, transistors, and interconnections have posed design challenges in the full integration of power-efficient CMOS radio-frequency integrated circuits (RF ICs). In addition, the parasitics of on-chip passive components that are integrated on lossy silicon substrates have made CMOS-based integrated circuits inferior to their compound-semiconductor counterparts. The parasitic effects of on-chip interconnections play a key role in RF circuit performance, particularly as the frequency of operation increases. Neglecting these effects leads to the significant degradation in circuit performance or even failure of operation in some cases. Furthermore, unlike transistors, miniaturization of interconnections does not improve their performance. This paper demonstrates the impact of metal layer resistivity and layout parasitics on an RF power amplifier (PA) and a low-noise amplifier (LNA). A nonlinear fully integrated 2.4-GHz class-E PA, with a class-F driver stage, and a 5-GHz LNA are discussed. The circuits were fabricated in a standard 0.18- mum CMOS technology. The layouts of the presented CMOS amplifiers were designed by carefully modeling the interconnection wires during the simulations and optimizing their widths for minimum parasitic effects and hence optimum measured circuit performance. Due to the careful layout design and interconnection optimization, the implemented amplifier circuits showed a good match between the measured and simulated performance characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2026194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5208517/05175419.pdf","startPage":"1882","endPage":"1890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2026194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of On-Chip Interconnections on CMOS RF Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of On-Chip Interconnections on CMOS RF Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5175419/","accessionNumber":"10828906","volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of On-Chip Interconnections on CMOS RF Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"ted-deen-2026194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118435S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5208517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5208517","articleId":"5175419","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5175420,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Kong","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/5427239/5175420/5175420-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kun Kong received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Shandong University, Shandong, China, in 2003.

The fundamental logic device in QCA is the majority gate. In this paper, we propose an efficient methodology for majority logic synthesis of arbitrary Boolean functions. We prove that our method provides a minimal majority expression and an optimal QCA layout for any given three-variable Boolean function. In order to obtain high-quality decomposed Boolean networks, we introduce a new decomposition scheme that can decompose all Boolean networks efficiently. Furthermore, our method removes all the redundancies that are produced in the process of converting a decomposed network into a majority network. In existing methods, however, these redundancies are not considered. We have built a majority logic synthesis tool based on our method and several existing logic synthesis tools. Experiments with 40 multiple-output benchmarks indicate that, compared to existing methods, 37 benchmarks are optimized by our method, up to 31.6%, 78.2%, 75.5%, and 83.3% reduction in level count, gate count, gate input count, and inverter count, respectively, is possible with the average being 4.7%, 14.5%, 13.3%, and 26.4%, respectively. We have also implemented the QCA layouts of 10 benchmarks by using our method. Results indicate that, compared to existing methods, up to 33.3%, 76.7%, and 75.5% reduction in delay, cell count, and area, respectively, is possible with the average being 8.1%, 28.9%, and 29.0%, respectively.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175420","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Quantum dots","Quantum cellular automata","Logic devices","Network synthesis","CMOS logic circuits","Boolean functions","MOS devices","Inverters","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","logic circuits","network synthesis","quantum dots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["majority logic synthesis methodology","quantum-dot cellular automata","logic device","arbitrary Boolean functions","optimal QCA layout","three-variable Boolean function","high-quality decomposed Boolean networks","decomposition scheme","gate input count","inverter count","gate count","logic synthesis tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Majority networks","minimum cost","quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA)","redundancy removal"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5427239/05175420.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2009.2028609","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2009.2028609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimized Majority Logic Synthesis Methodology for Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175420/","displayDocTitle":"An Optimized Majority Logic Synthesis Methodology for Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11168638","htmlLink":"/document/5175420/","volume":"9","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimized Majority Logic Synthesis Methodology for Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata","sourcePdf":"tnano-kong-2028609.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11349S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5427239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5427239","articleId":"5175420","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175422,"authors":[{"name":"Burhan Bayraktaroglu","affiliation":["RYDD, WPAFB, Air Force Research Laboratory, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Burhan","lastName":"Bayraktaroglu","id":"37328378000"},{"name":"Kevin Leedy","affiliation":["RYDD, WPAFB, Air Force Research Laboratory, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Leedy","id":"37266846900"},{"name":"Robert Neidhard","affiliation":["RYDD, WPAFB, Air Force Research Laboratory, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Neidhard","id":"37296257000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5175422","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":59,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1130},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zinc oxide","Thin film transistors","Substrates","Pulsed laser deposition","Microwave devices","Microwave transistors","Cutoff frequency","Displays","Thin film circuits","Optical pulses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave transistors","silicon","substrates","thin film transistors","zinc compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-frequency thin-film transistors","silicon substrates","power gain","drain-current on/off ratios","current density","microwave performances","size 1.2 mum","frequency 2.45 GHz","frequency 7.45 GHz","size 2.1 mum","size 50 mum","size 100 mum","Si","ZnO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FET","high frequency","microwave","nanocrystalline","on/off ratio","pulsed laser deposition","thin-film transistors (TFTs)","ZnO"]}],"abstract":"Record microwave frequency performance was achieved with nanocrystalline ZnO thin-film transistors fabricated on Si substrates.

In this paper, the use of an ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic is proposed for a linguistic task that involves the automated morphological segmentation of Ancient Greek word forms into stem and ending. The task of morphological analysis is essential for implementing text-processing applications such as semantic analysis and information retrieval. The difficulty of the morphological analysis task differs depending on the language chosen, being hardest in the case of highly-inflectional languages, where each stem may be associated with a large number of different endings. In this paper, focus is placed on the morphological analysis of ancient Greek, which has been shown to be a particularly hard task. To perform this task, a system for the automated morphological processing has been proposed, which implements the morphological analysis of words by coupling an iterative pattern-recognition algorithm with a modest amount of linguistic knowledge, expressed via a set of interactions associated with weights. In an earlier version of the system, these weights were determined by combining the input from specialized scientists with a lengthy manual optimization process. In this paper, the ACO metaheuristic is applied to the task of defining near-optimal system weights using an automated process based on a set of training data. The experiments performed indicate that the segmentation quality achieved by ACO is equivalent to or in several cases substantially higher than that achieved using manually optimized weights.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5208462/05175425.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2009.2014363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2009.2014363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using an Ant Colony Metaheuristic to Optimize Automatic Word Segmentation for Ancient Greek","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ant colony optimization","Information analysis","Information retrieval","Data mining","Pattern analysis","Performance analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Iterative algorithms","Training data","Text processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","linguistics","natural language processing","optimisation","pattern recognition","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony metaheuristic","optimize automatic word segmentation","ancient Greek","morphological analysis","semantic analysis","information retrieval","text processing application","highly-inflectional languages","automated morphological processing","iterative pattern-recognition algorithm","linguistic knowledge","manual optimization process","near-optimal system","segmentation quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ancient Greek","ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic","automated morphological analysis","heuristic function","text processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using an Ant Colony Metaheuristic to Optimize Automatic Word Segmentation for Ancient Greek","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5175425/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828601","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using an Ant Colony Metaheuristic to Optimize Automatic Word Segmentation for Ancient Greek","sourcePdf":"tevc-tambouratzis-2014363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072286S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5208462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5208462","articleId":"5175425","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175434,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Neto","affiliation":["Defense, Security and Safety, TNO, Den Haag, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5280584/5175434/5175434-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Neto (M'00) received the Laurea degree (summa cum laude) in electronic engineering from the University of Florence, Florence, Italy, in 1994 and the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetics from the University of Siena, Siena, Italy, in 2000.

In this study, we propose three new procedures that are able to sense the known spectrum of the candidate or primary user, fulfilling the requirements of open spectrum scenarios. These procedures are developed by following the framework of correlation matching, changing the traditional single frequency scan to a spectral scan with a particular shape and generalizing filter-bank designs. The proposed techniques are called Candidate methods, because their goal is to react only when the candidate's spectral shape is present. First, Candidate-F is proposed as a spectral detection method, where this is based on minimizing the Frobenius distance between correlation matrices, and can be viewed as an extended version of the weighted overlapped spectrum averaging estimate. Next, Candidate-G is presented, which is a new procedure that is based on a geodesic distance, and that presents the lowest complexity. Lastly, a third procedure is studied, Candidate-M, which provides the most compliant performance with the demanding open spectrum scenario by generalizing the Capon-spectral estimator. By means of the analytical results, simulations of receiver operating characteristics, and estimation variance, this study shows the advantages of Candidate-M over the existing filter bank or cyclostationary detector methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2027778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5312990/05175440.pdf","startPage":"4823","endPage":"4836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2027778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation Matching Approach for Spectrum Sensing in Open Spectrum Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Correlation Matching Approach for Spectrum Sensing in Open Spectrum Communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","volume":"57","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175440/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10977239","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation Matching Approach for Spectrum Sensing in Open Spectrum Communications","sourcePdf":"57tsp12-aperez-neira-2027778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097407S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5312990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5312990","articleId":"5175440","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5175443,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Huei Lee","affiliation":["California Technology Center, Research and Development, Numonyx, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5208517/5175443/5175443-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yung-Huei Lee (S'82\u2013M'86\u2013SM'06) received the B.S. degree from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1979 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1982 and 1986, respectively.","In 1984, he joined the Technology Development Group, Intel Corporation, as a DRAM Device Engineer, where he held a variety of technical management roles in the reliability and semiconductor technology development.

One of the possible applications for this array is in WLAN systems where high gain and low cost adaptable antennas promise increases in capacity and coverage. The array design utilizes key innovations in the design of Landstorfer antennas and feed/switching network. The Landstorfer antenna exhibits a high gain with 9.5 dBi and low mutual coupling between elements. A proposed reflector for the Landstorfer antenna is implemented and it allows the antenna array to be fabricated on a 2-layer PCB board. We also present a low cost feed/switching network which allows flexible control of the antenna patterns. The design makes use of PIN diodes as switching elements and a resonant inductor to improve the isolation of the PIN diodes. By integrating the antenna elements, feed/switching network and array configuration, a low cost reconfigurable Landstorfer planar array can be formed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Cost Reconfigurable Landstorfer Planar Antenna Array","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2028593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280584/05175446.pdf","startPage":"3051","endPage":"3061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2028593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175446/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Low Cost Reconfigurable Landstorfer Planar Antenna Array","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5175446/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917834","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Cost Reconfigurable Landstorfer Planar Antenna Array","sourcePdf":"57tap10-amak-2028593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061921S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5280584","articleId":"5175446","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5175447,"authors":[{"name":"Olli Luukkonen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering SMARAD CoE, Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5280584/5175447/5175447-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Olli Luukkonen was born on November 8, 1980 in Helsinki, Finland.

We show that the presence of the vias influences the oblique incidence TM absorption, and when properly designed, the insertion of the vias into the absorber structure results in a bandwidth enlargement and higher absorption performance.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2028601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280584/05175447.pdf","startPage":"3119","endPage":"3125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2028601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Thin Electromagnetic Absorber for Wide Incidence Angles and Both Polarizations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175447/","displayDocTitle":"A Thin Electromagnetic Absorber for Wide Incidence Angles and Both Polarizations","volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917798","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175447/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Thin Electromagnetic Absorber for Wide Incidence Angles and Both Polarizations","sourcePdf":"tap-luukkonen-2028601.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056008S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"5280584","articleId":"5175447","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5175453,"authors":[{"name":"Chow-Yen-Desmond Sim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chow-Yen-Desmond","lastName":"Sim","id":"37266406100"},{"name":"Chun-Chuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Changhua University of Education, Chang-Hua, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chun-Chuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"38004911200"},{"name":"Jeen-Sheen Row","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Changhua University of Education, Chang-Hua, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Jeen-Sheen","lastName":"Row","id":"37271616400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5175453","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":5889},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Patch antennas","Polarization","Feeds","Microstrip antennas","Resonance","Strips","Frequency measurement","Bandwidth","Antenna radiation patterns","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","electromagnetic coupling","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microstrip antennas","microstrip lines","slot antennas","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-feed dual-polarized microstrip patch antenna","low cross polarization","high isolation","dual orthogonal linearly-polarized mode","single radiating patch","aperture-coupled feed","compact resonant annular-ring slot","T-shaped microstrip feed line","meandering strip","impedance bandwidth","radiation pattern","frequency 2400 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual feed","dual polarization","patch antennas"]}],"abstract":"A dual-feed dual-polarized microstrip antenna with low cross polarization and high isolation is experimentally studied. Two different feed mechanisms are designed to excite a dual orthogonal linearly-polarized mode from a single radiating patch. One of the two modes is excited by an aperture-coupled feed, which is comprised of a compact resonant annular-ring slot and a T-shaped microstrip feed line; while the other is excited by a pair of meandering strips with a 180deg phase differences. Both the linearly-polarized modes are designed to operate at 2400 MHz frequency band, and from the measured results, it is found that the isolation between the two feeding ports is less than 40 dB across a 10 dB-input-impedance bandwidth of 14%. In addition, low cross polarization is observed from the radiation patterns of the two modes, especially at the broadside direction.

This is because it may be costly in several situations to run fiber to every home (or equivalent end-user premises) from the telecom central office (CO); also, providing wireless access from the CO to every end user may not be possible because of limited spectrum. Thus, running fiber as far as possible from the CO toward the end user and then having wireless access technologies take over may be an excellent compromise. How far should fiber penetrate before wireless takes over is an interesting engineering design and optimization problem, which we address in this paper. We propose and investigate the characteristics of an analytical model for network planning, namely optimum placements of base stations (BSs) and optical network units (ONUs) in a WOBAN (called the primal model, or PM). We develop several constraints to be satisfied: BS and ONU installation constraints, user assignment constraints, channel assignment constraints, capacity constraints, and signal-quality and interference constraints. To solve this PM with reasonable accuracy, we use ldquoLagrangean relaxationrdquo to obtain the corresponding ldquoLagrangean dualrdquo model. We solve this dual problem to obtain a lower bound (LB) of the primal problem. We also develop an algorithm (called the primal algorithm) to solve the PM to obtain an upper bound (UB). Via simulation, we compare this PM to a placement heuristic (called the cellular heuristic) and verify that the placement problem is quite sensitive to a set of chosen metrics.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2008.2008692","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5208599/05175459.pdf","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2008.2008692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN): Network Planning Using Lagrangean Relaxation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175459/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN): Network Planning Using Lagrangean Relaxation","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828371","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175459/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Wireless-Optical Broadband Access Network (WOBAN): Network Planning Using Lagrangean Relaxation","sourcePdf":"17tnet06-ssarkar-2008692.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11822S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5208599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5208599","articleId":"5175459","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5175469,"authors":[{"name":"Wenwen Chai","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5280584/5175469/5175469-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenwen Chai received the B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2004 and the M.S. degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, in 2007, both in electrical engineering.

With this rank function, we demonstrate that given a range of electric sizes which lead to a range of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n , the dense system of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) parameters can be compactly stored in \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n) units, and the dense matrix-vector multiplication can be performed in \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>\n (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n) operations. Moreover, the same order of accuracy can be kept across this range. The method is kernel independent, and hence is suitable for any integral-equation-based formulation. In addition, it is applicable to arbitrary structures. Numerical experiments from small electric sizes to 64 wavelengths have demonstrated the performance of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2028665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280584/05175469.pdf","startPage":"3147","endPage":"3159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2028665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An --Matrix-Based Integral-Equation Solver of Reduced Complexity and Controlled Accuracy for Solving Electrodynamic Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175469/","displayDocTitle":"An <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\cal H}^{2}$</tex></formula>-Matrix-Based Integral-Equation Solver of Reduced Complexity and Controlled Accuracy for Solving Electrodynamic Problems","volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917825","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175469/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\cal H}^{2}$</tex></formula>-Matrix-Based Integral-Equation Solver of Reduced Complexity and Controlled Accuracy for Solving Electrodynamic Problems","sourcePdf":"57tap10-djiao-2028665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138285S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5280584","articleId":"5175469","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5175475,"authors":[{"name":"Fuhai Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, School of Mathematical Sciences, and LMAM, Peking University, Beijing, China","Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering Programmatic Core, and Research Division, Department of Radiology, The Methodist Hospital ResearchInstitute, Weill Medical College, Cornell University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Fuhai","lastName":"Li","id":"37289386400"},{"name":"Xiaobo Zhou","affiliation":["Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering Programmatic Core, and Research Division, Department of Radiology, The Methodist Hospital Research Institute, Weill Medical College, Cornell University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37292873900"},{"name":"Jinwen Ma","affiliation":["Department of Information Science, School of Mathematical Sciences, and LMAM, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinwen","lastName":"Ma","id":"37337146900"},{"name":"Stephen T.

However, the complex, dynamic cell cycle behavior poses new challenges to the existing image segmentation and tracking methods. This paper presents a fully automated tracking method for quantitative cell cycle analysis. In the proposed tracking method, we introduce a neighboring graph to characterize the spatial distribution of neighboring nuclei, and a novel dissimilarity measure is designed based on the spatial distribution, nuclei morphological appearance, migration, and intensity information. Then, we employ the integer programming and division matching strategy, together with the novel dissimilarity measure, to track cell nuclei. We applied this new tracking method for the tracking of HeLa cancer cells over several cell cycles, and the validation results showed that the high accuracy for segmentation and tracking at 99.5% and 90.0%, respectively. The tracking method has been implemented in the cell-cycle analysis software package, DCELLIQ, which is freely available.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Cancer","Drugs","Image segmentation","Bioinformatics","Fluorescence","Microscopy","Biomedical engineering","Radiology","Hospitals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","cellular biophysics","image segmentation","integer programming","medical image processing","software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple nuclei tracking","integer programming","quantitative cancer cell cycle analysis","automated cell segmentation","time-lapse fluorescence microscopy","image segmentation","neighboring graph","neighboring nuclei spatial distribution","nuclei morphological appearance","division matching strategy","HeLa cancer cells","DCELLIQ software package"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-cancer drug screening","cell cycle analysis","segmentation and tracking","time-lapse fluorescence microscopy"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Cell Cycle","Cell Movement","Cell Nucleus","Cell Nucleus","HeLa Cells","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Microscopy, Fluorescence","Neoplasms","Neoplasms","Reproducibility of Results","Software"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5371922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2009.2027813","startPage":"96","endPage":"105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5371922/05175475.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2009.2027813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Nuclei Tracking Using Integer Programming for Quantitative Cancer Cell Cycle Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiple Nuclei Tracking Using Integer Programming for Quantitative Cancer Cell Cycle Analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11049999","pubMedId":"19643704","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","volume":"29","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175475/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Nuclei Tracking Using Integer Programming for Quantitative Cancer Cell Cycle Analysis","sourcePdf":"tmi-li-2027813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075085S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5371922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5371922","articleId":"5175475","onlineDate":"28 July 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":5175493,"authors":[{"name":"Juan C.

Hence, the inverter is able to inject independently active and reactive power to the grid. The controller provides a proper dynamics decoupled from the grid-impedance magnitude and phase. The system is also able to control active and reactive power flows independently for a large range of impedance grid values.

An autonomous agent should be able to decide its own goals and behaviours in order to fulfil these goals. When the agent has no previous knowledge, it must learn what to do in every state (policy of behaviour). If the agent uses Q-learning, this implies that it learns the utility value Q of each action-state pair. Typically, an autonomous agent living in a complex environment has to interact with different objects present in that world. In this case, the number of states of the agent in relation to those objects may increase as the number of objects increases, making the learning process difficult to deal with. The proposed modification appears as a solution in order to cope with this problem. The experimental results prove the usefulness of the OQ-learning in this situation, in comparison with the standard Q-learning algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autonomous agents","Learning","Decision making","Artificial intelligence","Standards development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["standard learning algorithm","object Q-learning","autonomous agent","utility value","action-state pair","complex environment","learning process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Q-Learning","objects","decision making","autonomous agents"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DEVLRN.2009.5175508","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 8th International Conference on Development and Learning","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 8th International Conference on Development and Learning","pdfPath":"/iel5/5167200/5175505/05175508.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2009.5175508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to deal with objects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175508","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to deal with objects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175508/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175508/","accessionNumber":"10801953","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to deal with objects","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048852S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5167200","isNumber":"5175505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5167200","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5175505","articleId":"5175508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-26"},{"_id":5175512,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Ying Yu","id":"38007815800"},{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Wave Scattering and Remote Sensing Information (Ministry of Education), Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Bin Wang","id":"37559493800"},{"name":"Liming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Liming Zhang","id":"37280177900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4117-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4118-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9476"}],"articleNumber":"5175512","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Neurons","Humans","Intelligent robots","Discrete transforms","Brain modeling","Biological neural networks","Binary codes","Pulse generation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","cognition","discrete cosine transforms","eye","medical computing","neural nets","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse discrete cosine transform","saliency-based visual attention","Hebbian-based neural network","binary codes","human brain","neuron pulse","eye fixation","real-time system","robot navigation","virtual human system","intelligent auto-focus system","digital camera"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visual attention","Bottom-up","Saliency","Discrete cosine transform","Principal component analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a saliency-based attention model based on pulsed cosine transform that simulates the lateral surround inhibition of neurons with similar visual features.

Although bottom-up attention enables robots to autonomously explore the environment, learn to recognize objects, and interact with humans, the instability of their attention as well as the poor quality of the information detected at the attentional location has hindered the robots from processing dynamic movements. In order to learn actions, robots have to stably attend to the relevant movement by ignoring noises while maintaining sensitivity to a new important movement. To meet these contradictory requirements, I introduce mechanisms for retinal filtering and stochastic attention selection inspired by human vision. The former reduces the complexity of the peripheral vision and thus enables robots to focus more on the currently-attended location. The latter allows robots to flexibly shift their attention to a new prominent location, which must be relevant to the demonstrated action. The signals detected at the attentional location are then enriched based on the spatial and temporal continuity so that robots can learn to recognize objects, movements, and their associations. Experimental results show that the proposed system can extract key actions from human action demonstrations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 8th International Conference on Development and Learning","pdfPath":"/iel5/5167200/5175505/05175517.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 8th International Conference on Development and Learning","doi":"10.1109/DEVLRN.2009.5175517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2009.5175517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From bottom-Up visual attention to robot action learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Filtering","Object detection","Retina","Human robot interaction","Stochastic processes","Robot vision systems","Data mining","Cognitive robotics","Stochastic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning by example","mobile robots","object recognition","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bottom-up visual attention","robot action learning","important movement","retinal filtering","stochastic attention selection","human vision","peripheral vision","currently-attended location","attentional location","object recognition","human action demonstrations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["learning from demonstration","bottom-up visual attention","what to imitate","key actions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"From bottom-Up visual attention to robot action learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175517/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10801962","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From bottom-Up visual attention to robot action learning","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05227S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5167200","isNumber":"5175505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5167200","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5175505","articleId":"5175517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5175534,"authors":[{"name":"Constantin A.

While there is consensus on the role of the statistical structure of the physical environment in shaping the natural input to the sensory system, it is not well understood how the sensory apparatus itself and its active use during behavior determine the statistics of the input. To explore this issue, a virtual human agent is simulated navigating through a wooded environment under full control of its gaze allocation during walking. Independent causes for the images obtained during navigation are learned with algorithms that have been shown to extract computationally useful representations similar to those encountered in the primary visual cortex of the mammalian brain. The distributions of properties of the learned simple cell like units are in good agreement with a wealth of data on the visual system including the oblique effect, the meridional effect, properties of neurons in the macaque visual cortex, and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data on orientation selectivity in humans and monkeys. Finally, this analysis sheds new light on the discussion on orientation anisotropies based on carpented environments. Thus, when learning computational representations it is not sufficient to consider only the regularities of the environment but also the regularities imposed by the sensory apparatus and its use during behavior need to be taken into account.","doi":"10.1109/DEVLRN.2009.5175534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2009.5175534","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 8th International Conference on Development and Learning","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 8th International Conference on Development and Learning","pdfPath":"/iel5/5167200/5175505/05175534.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning independent causes in natural images explains the spacevariant oblique effect","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175534/","conferenceDate":"5-7 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Learning independent causes in natural images explains the spacevariant oblique effect","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10801979","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5175534/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning independent causes in natural images explains the spacevariant oblique effect","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082547S","chronDate":"5-7 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5167200","isNumber":"5175505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5167200","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5175505","articleId":"5175534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-08"},{"_id":5175536,"authors":[{"name":"Tingfan Wu","affiliation":["Machine Perception Laboratory, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tingfan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37534601600"},{"name":"Nicholas J.

Inversion-based feedforward control techniques have been successfully implemented in various applications. Usually, to account for adverse effects such as dynamics variations and disturbances, the inverse feedforward control is applied by augmenting it with a feedback control. However, such effects have not been directly addressed in existing system-inversion methods, and the integration of the feedback control with the inversion-based feedforward control is performed in an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ad</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hoc</i>\n manner, which may not lead to an optimal complement of the inversion-based feedforward control with the feedback control. The contribution of this paper is the development of the following: 1) a robust system-inversion approach to directly account for and then minimize the dynamics-uncertainty effect when finding the inversion-based feedforward controller, and 2) a systematic integration (of such a feedforward controller) with a robust feedback controller. The proposed robust inversion method achieves a guaranteed tracking performance of the feedforward control for bounded dynamics uncertainties.

This method is based on rules of equal area and superposition of center of gravity (cg) of the PWM section with the sine reference signal. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed SHE method, a five-level voltage source inverter with elimination of 11 low-order harmonics is investigated.

Although these power-electronics-based components provide exceptional performance, they are prone to instability due to their constant power characteristics that lead to negative impedance. When designing these systems, integrators must consider the impedance versus frequency at a power system interface (which designates source and load). Stability criteria have been developed in terms of source and load impedance for both dc and ac power systems, and it is often helpful to have techniques for impedance measurement. For dc power systems, the measurement techniques have been well established. This paper suggests several methods for measuring ac impedance including utilization of power converters, wound-rotor induction machines, and chopper circuits.

Resonance between source and load coils is achieved with lumped capacitors terminating the coils. A circuit model is developed to describe the system with a single receiver, and extended to describe the system with two receivers. With parameter values chosen to obtain good fits, the circuit models yield transfer frequency responses that are in good agreement with experimental measurements over a range of frequencies that span the resonance. Resonant frequency splitting is observed experimentally and described theoretically for the multiple receiver system. In the single receiver system at resonance, more than 50% of the power that is supplied by the actual source is delivered to the load. In a multiple receiver system, a means for tracking frequency shifts and continuously retuning the lumped capacitances that terminate each receiver coil so as to maximize efficiency is a key issue for future work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","volume":"24","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10812270","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5175611/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Resonant Coupling As a Potential Means for Wireless Power Transfer to Multiple Small Receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Resonant Coupling As a Potential Means for Wireless Power Transfer to Multiple Small Receivers","sourcePdf":"tpel-hoburg-2017195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120741S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5075737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"624","xplore-issue":"5075737","articleId":"5175611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5175615,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chien-Chung Chen photograph and biography not available at time of publication."]},"firstName":"Chien-Chung","lastName":"Chen","id":"38254845900"},{"name":"Cheng-Mu Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication, Kun Shan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9425/5175590/5175615/5175615-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Mu Tsai was born in Tainan, Taiwan, on October 1974.

Thanks to the development of modern digital equipment, optimization work for non-image optics plays a role in modern optical engineering. So far Least Damping Square, Taguchi Fuzzy, and simulation annealing methods have been introduced and some of them has been applied to many items of commercial simulation software. However, GA is first introduced in this paper for non-image optical design and optimization, although it has been for many years been used as effective optimization method in image optics; In this paper, GAs are written in the form of macro language from ASAP. During the design process, we used one OPTEK Technology OVS3WBCR44 LED as the light source of the general projection display. Because of the extensiveness of the LEDs, the collection efficiency within the desired acceptance angle was not expected to be high. Due to the particular acceptance angle (cone), we needed a condenser lens system, which satisfied the light small angle incident to 0.59-in liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCOS) pixels. The optical engine in this paper is designed for a compact LCOS projector with a white LED light source and the employment of an LCOS panel has been reduced to one piece in order to get the best volumetric size. Optical design specification is mainly for an 11\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\"</sup>\n projected screen, whose objective distance is close to 420 mm with fixed focal lens. GA methods are applied in this research in order to achieve maximum brightness and uniformity. Compared to traditional optimization methods, such as Least Damping Square, the GA used in this research gives reasonably good results.","doi":"10.1109/JDT.2009.2021540","startPage":"293","endPage":"305","publicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JDT.2009.2021540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175590","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Display Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/9425/5175590/05175615.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Design of LCOS Optical Engine and Optimization With Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175615/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optical Design of LCOS Optical Engine and Optimization With Genetic Algorithm","volume":"5","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5175615/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10794664","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Design of LCOS Optical Engine and Optimization With Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"jdt-fang-2021540.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136797S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"5175590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5175590","articleId":"5175615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5175627,"authors":[{"name":"Ronen Talmon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5165109/5175627/5175627-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ronen Talmon received the B.A. degree in mathematics and computer science from the Open University, Ra'anana, Israel, in 2005.

Using a complete system representation in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain, we formulate a constrained minimization problem of total output noise power subject to the constraint that the signal component of the output is the desired signal, up to some prespecified filter. Then, we employ the general sidelobe canceler (GSC) structure to transform the problem into an equivalent unconstrained form by decoupling the constraint and the minimization. The CTF-GSC is obtained by applying a convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation on the GSC scheme, which is a more accurate and a less restrictive than a multiplicative transfer function (MTF) approximation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed beamformer outperforms the transfer function GSC (TF-GSC) in reverberant environments and achieves both improved noise reduction and reduced speech distortion.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2020891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5165109/05175627.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2020891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165109","startPage":"1420","endPage":"1434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutive Transfer Function Generalized Sidelobe Canceler","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Convolutive Transfer Function Generalized Sidelobe Canceler","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 July 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10794746","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5175627/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutive Transfer Function Generalized Sidelobe Canceler","sourcePdf":"17tasl05-icohen-2020891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110719S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5165109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5165109","articleId":"5175627","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5175684,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This model can be used to adjust security configurations of services to provide sufficient protection and satisfy service performance requirements for SOA-based systems simultaneously. The construction of this model includes the development of a set of metrics to quantitatively measure the performance and security of services, the development of a tradeoff objective function incorporating service performance and security, and the parameter estimation through experiments. An example of service-based secure voice communication system is used to illustrate the construction of this model.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2009.141","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175785/5175786/05175835.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"294","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2009.141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Tradeoff Model for Service Performance and Security in Service-Based Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Tradeoff Model for Service Performance and Security in Service-Based Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5175835/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10803633","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175835/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Tradeoff Model for Service Performance and Security in Service-Based Systems","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3709a287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054527S","chronDate":"6-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175785","isNumber":"5175786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175785","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5175786","articleId":"5175835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5175840,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Dietze","affiliation":["Knowledge Media Institute, The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Dietze","id":"37545464700"},{"name":"Alessio Gugliotta","affiliation":["Knowledge Media Institute, The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Gugliotta","id":"37688831300"},{"name":"John Domingue","affiliation":["Knowledge Media Institute, The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Domingue","id":"37375946600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3709-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5175840","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Metrics for Similarity-Based Semantic Web Service Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175785/5175786/05175840.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2009.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175786","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2009.26","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantic Web"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open systems","semantic Web","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semantic Web service discovery","machine-interpretable semantic description","interoperability","reusability","semantic level mediation","semiautomatic mapping","SWS matchmaking algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semantic Web Services","Interoperability","Conceptual Spaces","Discovery","Mediation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175840","abstract":"Semantic Web services (SWS) aim at the automated discovery and orchestration of Web services on the basis of comprehensive, machine-interpretable semantic descriptions. However, heterogeneities between distinct SWS representations pose strong limitations w.r.t. interoperability and reusability. Hence, semantic level mediation, i.e. mediation between concurrent semantic representations, is a key requirement to allow SWS matchmaking algorithms to compare capabilities of distinct SWS. In that, semantic level mediation requires to identify similarities across distinct SWS representations. Since current approaches to mediate between distinct service annotations rely either on manual one-to-one mappings or on semi-automatic mappings based on the exploitation of linguistic or structural similarities, these are perceived to be costly and error-prone. We propose a mediation approach enabling the implicit representation of similarities across distinct SWS by grounding these in so-called mediation spaces (MS). Given a set of SWS and their respective MS grounding, a general-purpose mediator automatically computes similarities to identify the most appropriate SWS for a given request. A prototypical application illustrates our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10803638","htmlLink":"/document/5175840/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"6-10 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Metrics for Similarity-Based Semantic Web Service Discovery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Metrics for Similarity-Based Semantic Web Service Discovery","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3709a327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056723S","chronDate":"6-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175785","isNumber":"5175786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175785","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5175786","articleId":"5175840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5175854,"authors":[{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Hao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37403467600"},{"name":"Michael R.

WSRec is implemented by Java language and deployed to the real-world environment. To study the prediction performance, a total of 21,197 public Web services are obtained from the Internet and a large-scale real-world experiment is conducted, where more than 1.5 millions test results are collected from 150 service users in different countries on 100 publicly available Web services located all over the world.

Most of the previous researches have considered these three problems separately. However, we argue that these three problems are intrinsically related and hence, cannot be treated separately. We propose a proactive event-driven model where user activities and services are treated as events. We then graphically model a SOA system into a network of activities called \"activity network\" (ANet). The nodes of such a network are the services and the edges their mutual causal dependency. We show how both functional as well as contextual information can be incorporated into the network and then justify why that is necessary for solving the three problems mentioned hereby. We then propose an abstraction technique that helps us to simplify the ANet and provide an architectural platform where the three problems can be solved in an efficient manner.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 July 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10803680","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5175883/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Abstraction Framework for Service Composition in Event-Driven SOA Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Abstraction Framework for Service Composition in Event-Driven SOA Systems","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3709a671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05258S","chronDate":"6-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175785","isNumber":"5175786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175785","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5175786","articleId":"5175883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5175941,"authors":[{"name":"Farhana Zulkernine","affiliation":["School of Computing, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Farhana","lastName":"Zulkernine","id":"37540975600"},{"name":"Patrick Martin","affiliation":["School of Computing, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Martin","id":"37278040500"},{"name":"Chris Craddock","affiliation":["OOCTO,  CA Inc., Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Craddock","id":"37321010700"},{"name":"Kirk Wilson","affiliation":["CA, Inc., Portsmouth, NH, USA"],"firstName":"Kirk","lastName":"Wilson","id":"37303699100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3709-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5175941","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":353},"abstract":"Negotiation of service level agreements (SLAs) is very important for maintaining quality of service (QoS) of composite Web services-based business processes.

We propose a negotiation broker (NB) middleware framework to facilitate automated negotiations of SLAs for Web services in a service oriented architecture (SOA). High level business goals, contexts, preferences, constraints, and values of the negotiation issues are expressed as a policy specification by each of the negotiating parties. The NB maps the policy specifications to low level negotiation strategy models and parameters in order to conduct the negotiation locally as a trusted broker. We present a model and an example of the high level negotiation policy specification. We also present our NB framework including a prototype implementation to illustrate the mapping of the policy to a time-dependent negotiation strategy model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175785/5175786/05175941.pdf","startPage":"1043","endPage":"1050","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2009.157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2009.157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175786","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5175941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Policy-Based Middleware for Web Services SLA Negotiation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Middleware","Web services","Niobium","Prototypes","Intelligent agent","Packaging","Availability","Quality of service","Service oriented architecture","Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","formal specification","middleware","negotiation support systems","software architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["policy-based middleware","service level agreements negotiation","quality of service maintenance","composite Web services","business processes","negotiation broker middleware framework","service oriented architecture","high level negotiation policy specification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5175941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Policy-Based Middleware for Web Services SLA Negotiation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5175941/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10803738","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"6-10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Policy-Based Middleware for Web Services SLA Negotiation","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3709b043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12681S","chronDate":"6-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175785","isNumber":"5175786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175785","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5175786","articleId":"5175941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5176007,"authors":[{"name":"Huynh Thi Thanh Binh","affiliation":["Hanoi University of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Huynh Thi Thanh","lastName":"Binh","id":"37689307700"},{"name":"Nguyen Duc Nghia","affiliation":["Hanoi University of Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nguyen Duc","lastName":"Nghia","id":"38184881000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3580-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5176007","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"abstract":"Given a connected, weighted, undirected graph G=(V, E) and a bound D, bounded diameter minimum spanning tree problem (BDMST) seeks spanning tree on G with smallest weight in which no path between two vertices contains more than D edges.

Two common types of learning that are often mentioned are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. One often understands that in supervised learning, the system is given the desired output, and it is required to produce the correct output for the given input, while in unsupervised learning the system is given only the input and the objective is to find the natural structure inherent in the input data. We, however, suggest that even with unsupervised learning, the information inside the input, the structure of the input, and the sequence that the input is given to the system actually make the learning \"supervised\" in some way. Therefore, we recommend that in order to make the machine learn, even in a \"supervised\" manner, we should use an \"unsupervised learning\" model together with an appropriate way of presenting the input. We propose in this paper a simple plasticity neural network model that has the ability of storing information as well as storing the association between a pair of inputs. We then introduce two simple unsupervised learning rules and a framework to supervise our neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.92","startPage":"307","endPage":"312","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175945/5175946/05176011.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervising an Unsupervised Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Unsupervised learning","Supervised learning","Machine learning","Humans","Algorithm design and analysis","Machine learning algorithms","Deductive databases","Intelligent networks","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised neural network","machine learning","unsupervised learning","supervised learning","plasticity neural network model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Networks","Supervised learning","Unsupervised learning","plasticity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5176011/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Supervising an Unsupervised Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5176011/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10803809","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervising an Unsupervised Neural Network","confLoc":"Dong hoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"3580a307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.174363S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175945","isNumber":"5175946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175945","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5175946","articleId":"5176011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5176015,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Chann Chang","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Chann","lastName":"Chang","id":"37573663000"},{"name":"Chin-Yuan Fan","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan-Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Yuan","lastName":"Fan","id":"37694016100"},{"name":"Jih-Chang Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Finance, Vanung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jih-Chang","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37587803100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3580-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5176015","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Demand forecasting","Load forecasting","Energy consumption","Predictive models","Testing","Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Artificial intelligence","Fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","load forecasting","power consumption","power engineering computing","statistical analysis","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted evolving fuzzy neural network","electricity demand forecasting","evolving fuzzy neural network framework","weighted factor","exponential transfer function","rule clustering method","Taiwan Power Company","power consumption","MAPE","WEFuNN model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision-making","E lectric power","Forecasting","Genetic Algorithm","Weighted evolving fuzzy neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5176015","abstract":"This research develops a weighted evolving fuzzy neural network for electricity demand forecasting in Taiwan. This study modifies the evolving fuzzy neural network framework (EFuNN framework) and adopts a weighted factor to calculate the importance of each factor among these different rules. In addition, an exponential transfer function (exp(-D)) is employed to transfer the distance of any two factors into the value of similarity among different rules, thus a different rule clustering method is developed accordingly. Seven explanatory factors identified by the Taiwan Power Company will affect the power consumption in Taiwan and these seven factors will be inputted into the WEFuNN to forecast the electricity demand in the future. The historical data will be applied to train the WEFuNN and then forecasts the future electricity demands. Finally, the model is compared with other approaches proposed in the literature. The experimental results reveal that the MAPE for WEFuNN model is 6.11% which outperforms the others. In summary, the WEFuNN model can be applied practically as an electricity demand forecasted tool in Taiwan.","doi":"10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.93","startPage":"330","endPage":"335","publicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5175946","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175945/5175946/05176015.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Weighted Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network for Electricity Demand Forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5176015/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Weighted Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network for Electricity Demand Forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5176015/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10824563","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Weighted Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network for Electricity Demand Forecasting","confLoc":"Dong hoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"3580a330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08796S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175945","isNumber":"5175946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175945","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5175946","articleId":"5176015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5176032,"authors":[{"name":"Xing-Wei Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xing-Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293609500"},{"name":"Hai-Quan Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hai-Quan","lastName":"Yang","id":"38006069400"},{"name":"Min Huang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Huang","id":"37273546000"},{"name":"Lei Guo","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Guo","id":"37083736300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3580-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5176032","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unicast","Routing","Particle swarm optimization","Bandwidth","Error analysis","Nash equilibrium","Switches","Delay","Deductive databases","Database systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","quality of service","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ABC","always best connected concept","QoS unicast routing scheme","particle swarm optimization","gaming analysis","Pareto optimum","Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Always Best Connected","QoS Unicast Routing","Partical Swarm Optimization Algorithm","Nash Equilibrium","Pareto Optimum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5176032","abstract":"In this paper, a QoS unicast routing scheme with ABC supported is proposed.

In fact, power line channel is time-varying due to the appliances that are connected to outlets since appliances often exhibit input impedance that is a function of the instantaneous amplitude of the mains voltage. Hence, constructing a discrete time-varying block channel model in the time domain that captures the cyclostationary nature of the channel response, we propose the overall input output relationship for the case where multiple appliances are cascaded. Thereafter, we numerically verify whether the model is appropriately designed for a real test channel and compare two precoder schemes in terms of error probability performance.","doi":"10.1109/CTRQ.2009.20","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Communication Theory, Reliability, and Quality of Service","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Communication Theory, Reliability, and Quality of Service","pdfPath":"/iel5/5176050/5176051/05176078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTRQ.2009.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5176051","startPage":"103","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Varying PLC Network Modeling with Wavelet MDFB and Weighted OFDM Precoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5176078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time-Varying PLC Network Modeling with Wavelet MDFB and Weighted OFDM Precoders","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5176078/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10803899","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5176078/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Varying PLC Network Modeling with Wavelet MDFB and Weighted OFDM Precoders","confLoc":"Colmar, France","sourcePdf":"3696a103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076274S","chronDate":"20-25 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5176050","isNumber":"5176051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5176050","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5176051","articleId":"5176078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5176080,"authors":[{"name":"Sandy Rahme","affiliation":["LAAS, CNRS, Toulouse, France","UPS INSA INPISAE LAAS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Sandy","lastName":"Rahme","id":"37680433300"},{"name":"Yann Labit","affiliation":["LAAS, CNRS, Toulouse, France","UPS INSA INPISAE LAAS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Labit","id":"37322101100"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gouaisbaut","affiliation":["LAAS, CNRS, Toulouse, France","UPS INSA INPISAE LAAS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Gouaisbaut","id":"37299734300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4423-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3696-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5176080","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Communication system traffic control","Traffic control","Monitoring","Sliding mode control","Delay effects","Fluid flow","State estimation","Robustness","Fluid dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","computer network reliability","delays","Internet","observers","perturbation techniques","queueing theory","robust control","smoothing methods","telecommunication control","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["observer-based sliding mode control","anomaly detection","TCP/AQM network","traffic monitoring","anomaly estimation","network security","time delay system","TCP fluid flow model","state estimation","system robustness","perturbation signal","network DDoS attack","fault reconstruction","smoothing technique","Simulink","Internet","active queue management"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, traffic monitoring and especially anomaly estimation have constituted an open problem in the network community.

One of the most important structural features of signal is presence of episodes when frequency of pulses arriving from certain sets of inputs (receptors) or single pulse timing become correlated or partially synchronized. Recognition of signal synchrony under a wide and a priori unknown range of conditions still remains a difficult problem despite numerous network models proposed for its solution. In the present work this problem is solved by a network based on a neuron model being an extension of commonly used leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. High synchrony recognition reliability for signals with strongly varying parameters is achieved by this model due to introduced neuron stabilization mechanism, homeostatic properties of the network and proposed variant of synaptic plasticity laws which changes synaptic weights in two cases - when neuron fires and when postsynaptic pulse generation is suppressed by inhibitory synapses.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178580","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178580","startPage":"1633","endPage":"1639","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178580.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178580/","displayDocTitle":"Self-organized spiking neural network recognizing phase/frequency correlations","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10802650","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178580/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organized spiking neural network recognizing phase/frequency correlations","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047002S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5178581,"authors":[{"name":"Han Honggui","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Han Honggui","id":"37087874603"},{"name":"Qiao Junfei","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Qiao Junfei","id":"37087785167"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178581","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Biological neural networks","Sensitivity analysis","Feedforward neural networks","Feedforward systems","Least squares approximation","Convergence","Genetic algorithms","Neurons","Analysis of variance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","Fourier analysis","self-organising feature maps","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel pruning algorithm","self-organizing neural network","feed-forward neural network","sensitivity analysis","novel pruning feedforward neural network","hidden neurons","Fourier decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pruning algorithm","Sensitivity analysis of model output (SAMO)","Feed-forward neural network (FNN)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178581","abstract":"In this paper, a novel pruning algorithm is proposed for self-organizing the feed-forward neural network based on the sensitivity analysis, named novel pruning feed-forward neural network (NP-FNN).

This technique determines the relevance of the hidden nodes by analyzing the Fourier decomposition of the variance. Then each hidden node can obtain a contribution ratio. The connected weights of the hidden nodes with small ratio will be set as zeros. Therefore, the computational cost of the training process will be reduced significantly. It is clearly shown that the novel pruning algorithm minimizes the complexity of the final feed-forward neural network.

The main focus in many studies conducted so far has been on training and utilising neural networks as point estimators/predictors. Uncertainties prevailing within complex systems and dependencies amongst constituent entities are real threats for prediction performance of these types of metamodels. From a practical point of view, an indication of prediction accuracy is necessary before making a decision based on results yielded by a metamodel. In this paper we adopt neural network metamodels for constructing prediction intervals of stochastic system performance measures. Upper and lower bounds of a prediction interval are computed such that the real system performance will lie between them with a high probability. Demonstrated results for a real world case study show that the constructed prediction intervals cover the targets, are more informative and more suited for decision making, when compared with point predictions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178590/","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802660","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Constructing prediction intervals for neural network metamodels of complex systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing prediction intervals for neural network metamodels of complex systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068203S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5178591,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Khosravi","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Systems Research (CISR), Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Khosravi","id":"37407922100"},{"name":"Saeid Nahavandi","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Systems Research (CISR), Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Nahavandi","id":"37268675200"},{"name":"Doug Creighton","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Systems Research (CISR), Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Creighton","id":"37398162100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178591","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Discrete event simulation","Computational modeling","Power engineering and energy","Stochastic systems","USA Councils","IEEE members","Costs","Support vector machines","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","neural nets","stochastic processes","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal neural network metamodels","prediction intervals","complex systems","point prediction performance","network structure","interval prediction capability","topology","prediction band","mean square error","mean absolute percentage error","interval prediction method","interconnected entity","stochastic processes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178591","abstract":"Finding optimal structures for neural networks is remains an open problem, despite the rich array of literature on the application of neural networks in different areas of science and engineering. The stochastic nature of operations common in complex systems makes point prediction performance of neural network metamodels an additional challenge. We propose a method for selecting the best structure of a neural network metamodel. For selecting the network structure, the new method uses interval prediction capability of neural networks and chooses a topology that yields the narrowest prediction band for targets. This is an improvement on traditional criteria, such as mean square error or mean absolute percentage error. As a case study, the interval prediction method is applied to a metamodel of a complex system composed of many inextricably interconnected entities and stochastic processes. The demonstrated results expressly show that selecting the network structure based on the proposed method yields more reliable estimates.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178591","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178591.pdf","startPage":"1583","endPage":"1589","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing optimal neural network metamodels based on prediction intervals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Developing optimal neural network metamodels based on prediction intervals","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10802661","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178591/","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing optimal neural network metamodels based on prediction intervals","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099529S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5178592,"authors":[{"name":"Ondrej Linda","firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Linda","id":"37568523800"},{"name":"Todd Vollmer","firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Vollmer","id":"37568521700"},{"name":"Milos Manic","firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Manic","id":"37277736800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178592","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2476},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intrusion detection","Control systems","Data mining","Feature extraction","Artificial neural networks","Communication system control","Computer networks","Clustering algorithms","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer crime","invasive software","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection system","critical infrastructures","control system resiliency","control system security","SCADA","nuclear plant","hackers","malware","computer systems","cyber attacks","neural network based modeling","window based feature extraction technique","intrusion vectors","neural network learning algorithms","error-back propagation","Levenberg-Marquardt learning rule","normal behavior modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Intrusion Detection System","Neural Network","Control System"]}],"abstract":"Resiliency and security in control systems such as SCADA and nuclear plant's in today's world of hackers and malware are a relevant concern. Computer systems used within critical infrastructures to control physical functions are not immune to the threat of cyber attacks and may be potentially vulnerable. Tailoring an intrusion detection system to the specifics of critical infrastructures can significantly improve the security of such systems. The IDS-NNM - intrusion detection system using neural network based modeling, is presented in this paper. The main contributions of this work are: 1) the use and analyses of real network data (data recorded from an existing critical infrastructure); 2) the development of a specific window based feature extraction technique; 3) the construction of training dataset using randomly generated intrusion vectors; 4) the use of a combination of two neural network learning algorithms - the error-back propagation and Levenberg-Marquardt, for normal behavior modeling. The presented algorithm was evaluated on previously unseen network data. The IDS-NNM algorithm proved to be capable of capturing all intrusion attempts presented in the network communication while not generating any false alerts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network based Intrusion Detection System for critical infrastructures","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178592","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178592.pdf","startPage":"1827","endPage":"1834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network based Intrusion Detection System for critical infrastructures","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178592/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802662","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network based Intrusion Detection System for critical infrastructures","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056052S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5178595,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Wang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lili Wang","id":"37087338794"},{"name":"Wenlian Lu","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wenlian","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278863700"},{"name":"Tianping Chen","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tianping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276683900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178595","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178595","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Stability","Pattern recognition","Sufficient conditions","Neurons","State-space methods","Cellular neural networks","Orbits","Technological innovation","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delayed neural networks","multistable almost periodic solutions","asymptotic stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178595","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178595.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"3244","endPage":"3250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delayed neural networks with multistable almost periodic solutions","abstract":"In this paper, we are concerned with the multistability of almost periodic solutions of a class of delayed neural networks.

Power laws often coexist with some degree of self-organization either based on growth and preferential attachment (which seems to be the case in sociological/technological networks) or duplication (which seems to be the case for biological/methabolic networks). Quite recently a power law graph with exponent gamma ap 2 has been observed in fMRI brain studies of correlations of functional centers of activity. We study the model we introduced previously to explore possible mechanisms existing in large neural networks that might lead to power law connectivity. The model (referred to as the spike flow model) resembles a kind of spiking neural network and yields a power law graph with exactly gamma = 2 as a byproduct of its dynamical behavior. In this paper we investigate whether the power law is robust under certain changes to the model's dynamics. In particular we study the effect of merging the model with a random Erdos-Renyi graph which can be interpreted as an addition of long range myelinated connections. Our numerical results indicate that as long as the density of Erdos-Renyi fraction is bounded by a constant, the power law is preserved in systems of appropriate size.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178633","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178633.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178633","startPage":"2541","endPage":"2546","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robustness of power laws in degree distributions for spiking neural networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178633/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802806","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness of power laws in degree distributions for spiking neural networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069657S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5178638,"authors":[{"name":"Ron Sun","affiliation":["Department of Cognitive Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Sun","id":"37269744500"},{"name":"Isaac Naveh","affiliation":["Department of Cognitive Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Naveh","id":"37990956200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178638","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178638","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognition","Neural networks","Equations","Sun","Aggregates","Humans","Computational modeling","Automata","Social network services","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive systems","multi-agent systems","neural nets","social sciences","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive realistic simulation","academic science","social simulation","Gilbert model","equation-based model","agent-based model","neural network model","CLARION cognitive architecture","scientific article distribution","probability distribution"]}],"abstract":"This work describes a cognitively realistic approach to social simulation.

Using this agent model, results comparable to previous simulations and to human data are obtained.

A novel LMI-based stability criterion is obtained by using Lyapunov functional theory to guarantee the asymptotic stability of TSFHNNs with discrete and distributed time-varying delays. Here we choose a generalized Lyapunov functional and introduce a parameterized model transformation with free weighting matrices to it, in order to obtain stability region.

Utilizing these dynamic time delay parameters, the proposed structure can adequately identify different classes of nonlinear systems expressed in the input-output representation form and pure time delay. Otherwise, to overcome the particles' premature convergence, the white noise and logistic mapping are used to enhance the particles' search performance. Furthermore, the parameters in the dynamic feedforward neural network are trained by the modified PSO method.

However, the problems of overfitting and premature convergence to local optima usually pose great challenges in the practice of MLFNNs during the training procedure. In this paper a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) regressor optimized by particle swarm algorithm (PSO) is proposed for generating the control actions and the learning rules for the critic and action networks. PSO is introduced to select the LS-SVM's hyper-parameters. The introduction of the SVM based training mechanism imparts the developed algorithm with inherent capacity for combating the overfitting problem as well as showing relatively high efficiency in converging to the optima. Simulation on the balancing of a cart pole plant shows that the proposed learning strategy is verified as faster convergence and higher efficiency as compared to traditional BP based adaptive dynamic programming approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178668","startPage":"903","endPage":"908","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178668.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LS-SVM based neural controller as optimized by particle swarm algorithm using dual heuristic dynamic programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178668/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"LS-SVM based neural controller as optimized by particle swarm algorithm using dual heuristic dynamic programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178668/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802841","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LS-SVM based neural controller as optimized by particle swarm algorithm using dual heuristic dynamic programming","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076579S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5178671,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Jose Cordova","affiliation":["Departamento de ConControl, CINVESTAV, Mexico"],"firstName":"Juan Jose","lastName":"Cordova","id":"37995459900"},{"name":"Wen Yu","affiliation":["Departamento de ConControl, CINVESTAV, Mexico"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37279841300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178671","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178671","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Robustness","Robust stability","Nonlinear systems","Uncertainty","Greenhouses","Backpropagation algorithms","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Mathematical model","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov methods","neural nets","nonlinear systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stable Fourier neural network","lettuce growth modeling","nonlinear systems","neuroidentifier","robust modification","Lyapunov stability","input-to-state stability","robust training","green house"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178671","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178671.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"591","endPage":"596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable fourier neural networks with application to modeling lettuce growth","abstract":"In general, neural networks cannot match non-linear systems exactly.

We first introduce the field of autonomous flying robots, reviewing the most relevant contributes on this research field and highlighting the elements of novelty contained in our approach. We then describe the simulation model we have elaborated and the results obtained in different experimental scenarios. In all experiments, MAV teams made by four agents have to navigate autonomously through an unknown environment, reach a certain target and finally neutralize it through a self-detonation. The different setups comprise an environment with various obstacles (skyscrapers) and a fixed target, one with a moving target, and one where the target (fixed or moving) needs to be attacked cooperatively in order to be neutralized. The results obtained show how the evolved controllers are able to perform the various tasks with an accuracy level between 72% and 94% when the target has to be approached individually. The performance slightly decreases only when the target is both able to move and can only be neutralized through a coordinated operation. The paper ends with a discussion on the possible applications of autonomous MAV teams to real life scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178702","startPage":"2717","endPage":"2724","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178702.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Individual and cooperative tasks performed by autonomous MAV Teams driven by embodied neural network controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178702/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Individual and cooperative tasks performed by autonomous MAV Teams driven by embodied neural network controllers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178702/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802875","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Individual and cooperative tasks performed by autonomous MAV Teams driven by embodied neural network controllers","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.181028S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5178707,"authors":[{"name":"Girish K.

By employing a specific nonlinear unit, the proposed neural network is proved to be convergent to the optimal solution in finite time, which increases the computation efficiency dramatically. Compared with most of existing stability conditions, i.e., asymptotical stability and exponential stability, the obtained finite-time stability result is more attractive, and therefore could be considered as a useful supplement to the current literature. In addition, a switching structure is suggested to further speed up the neural network convergence. Moreover, by using the penalty function method, the proposed neural network can be extended straightforwardly to solving the constrained optimization problem. Finally, the satisfactory performance of the proposed approach is illustrated by two simulation examples.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178723","startPage":"538","endPage":"543","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178723.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving convex optimization problems using recurrent neural networks in finite time","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Neural networks","Constraint optimization","Asymptotic stability","Current supplies","Convergence","Robot control","Design optimization","Lagrangian functions","Quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","convex programming","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex optimization problems","recurrent neural networks","asymptotical stability","exponential stability","finite-time stability","switching structure","penalty function method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Solving convex optimization problems using recurrent neural networks in finite time","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178723/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802896","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving convex optimization problems using recurrent neural networks in finite time","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055993S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5178731,"authors":[{"name":"Alan J.

We propose and implement an efficient Hebbian learning method with homeostasis for a network of spiking neurons. Similar to STDP, timing between spikes is used for synaptic modification. Homeostasis ensures that the synaptic weights are bounded and the learning is stable. The winner take all mechanism is also implemented to promote competitive learning among output neurons. We have implemented this method in a C++ object oriented code (called CSpike). We have tested the code on four images of Gabor filters and found bell-shaped tuning curves using 36 test set images of Gabor filters in different orientations. These bell-shapes curves are similar to those experimentally observed in the V1 and MT/V5 area of the mammalian brain.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178751","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178751.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178751","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1060","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178751","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hebbian learning with winner take all for spiking neural networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178751/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802924","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hebbian learning with winner take all for spiking neural networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06841S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5178754,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Hirose","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37298386700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178754","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","frequency-domain analysis","neural nets","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex-valued neural networks","complex numbers","electromagnetic-wave","general signal processing","Fourier synthesis","frequency-domain treatment","Fourier transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178754","abstract":"This paper discusses what the merits of complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) arise from.

The viewpoint is essential in general to deal with waves such as electromagnetic-wave and lightwave. Then we point out that, although we represent a complex number as an ordered pair of real numbers for example, we can reduce ineffective degree of freedom in learning or self-organization in CVNNs to achieve better generalization characteristics.

The main aim of using ensembles is to provide better performance than the individual classifiers. In order to build robust ensembles, it is often required that the base classifiers are as accurate as diverse among themselves-this is known as the diversity/accuracy dilemma. There are, in the literature, some works analyzing the ensemble performance in context of such a dilemma. However, the majority of them address the homogenous structures, i.e., ensembles composed only of the same type of classifiers. Motivated by such a limitation, this paper presents an empirical investigation on the diversity/accuracy dilemma for heterogeneous ensembles. In order to do so, multi-objective genetic algorithms will be used to guide the building of the ensemble systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178758/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802931","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178758/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Use of multi-objective genetic algorithms to investigate the diversity/accuracy dilemma in heterogeneous ensembles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of multi-objective genetic algorithms to investigate the diversity/accuracy dilemma in heterogeneous ensembles","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071852S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5178762,"authors":[{"name":"Syogo Takeuchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Syogo","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"38003442800"},{"name":"Takuya Kitamura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Kitamura","id":"38014236300"},{"name":"Shigeo Abe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeo","lastName":"Abe","id":"37328997700"},{"name":"Kazuhiro Fukui","affiliation":["Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Fukui","id":"37268491800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178762","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Support vector machines","Dictionaries","Kernel","Support vector machine classification","Principal component analysis","Constraint optimization","Neural networks","Performance evaluation","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionaries","linear programming","principal component analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming support vector machines","subspace methods","dictionaries","kernel principal component analysis","optimization problem"]}],"abstract":"In subspace methods, the subspace associated with a class is represented by a small number of vectors called dictionaries and using the dictionaries the similarity measure is defined and an input is classified into the class with the highest similarity. Usually, each dictionary is given an equal weight. But if subspaces of different classes overlap, the similarity measures for the overlapping regions will not give useful information for classification. In this paper, we propose optimizing the weights for the dictionaries using the idea of support vector machines (SVMs). Namely, first we map the input space into the empirical feature space, perform kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) for each class, and define a similarity measure. Then considering that the similarity measure corresponds to the hyperplane, we formulate the optimization problem as maximizing the margin between the class associated with the dictionaries and the remaining classes. The optimization problem results in all-at-once formulation of linear SVMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with that of the conventional methods for two-class problems.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178762","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178762.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","startPage":"3067","endPage":"3073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace based linear programming support vector machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Subspace based linear programming support vector machines","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178762/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802935","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace based linear programming support vector machines","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074715S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5178771,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-fei Qiao","affiliation":["Coll. of Electron. & Control Eng., Beijing Univ. of Technol., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun-fei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37273179900"},{"name":"Miao Li","affiliation":["Coll. of Electron. & Control Eng., Beijing Univ. of Technol., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Li","id":"37088134815"},{"name":"Hong-gui Han","affiliation":["Coll. of Electron. & Control Eng., Beijing Univ. of Technol., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hong-gui","lastName":"Han","id":"37534590300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178771","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Feedforward neural networks","Educational institutions","Control engineering","Feedforward systems","Computational efficiency","Convergence","Computer networks","Automatic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward","Fourier transforms","iterative methods","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing neural network","fast training algorithm","pruning algorithm","feed-forward neural network","fixed value subset-based training algorithm","training iteration","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","extended Fourier amplitude"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feed-forward neural network","Pruning","Subset-based training","Fourier amplitude"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178771","abstract":"A fast training and pruning algorithm is proposed for the feed-forward neural network (FNN) which consists of a fixed value subset-based training algorithm (FSBT) as well as a fast pruning algorithm (extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test, EFAST) in this paper.

Proximity aware mobile application is one such service which user consumes services offered by service providers in the user's environment. One key issue in providing proximity aware services in a wireless networking environment is congestion control at the server. To handle this problem, an effective connection admission control (CAC) mechanism is required. This paper investigate the feasibility of such a mechanism by comparing simulated back-propagation and learning vector quantization neural networks. The back-propagation neural networks was shown to have a higher performance.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178781","startPage":"2580","endPage":"2587","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178781.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based admission controller for proximity aware mobile services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Traffic control","Artificial neural networks","Communication system traffic control","Network servers","Vector quantization","Quality of service","Wireless networks","Fuzzy logic","Admission control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","learning systems","mobile radio","neurocontrollers","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network management","telecommunication traffic","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["connection admission control","proximity aware mobile service","back-propagation neural network","valued added service","wireless networking environment","server congestion control","learning vector quantization","wireless network traffic management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network","Back-Propagation","Learning Vector Quantization","Proximity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based admission controller for proximity aware mobile services","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178781/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802954","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based admission controller for proximity aware mobile services","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060217S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5178784,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37274114100"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280531600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178784","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178784","abstract":"This paper presents a new design procedure for the synthesis of associative memories based on cellular neural networks characterized by input and output matrices obtained based on cloning templates by solving a set of inequalities.

In this paper, elementary brain (neural interconnection pattern) evolution is simulated for various individuals in two similar artificial species. The simulation yields information about the learning, performance and brain structure of the population over time. Concepts from categorical neural semantic theory (CNST) are used to analyze the development of neural structure as evolution progresses. FlatWorld, a virtual two dimensional environment, is used to test survival skills of simple embodied neural agents. A combination of genetic algorithms (GA) and neural networks (NN) is applied within FlatWorld to study the relationship between the nurturing of the infant individuals during their developmental period with their subsequent behavior in the environment and the evolution of the associated brain structures. The results show evidence that during evolution, learning performance increases when brain structures required from CNST are formed, and that survival skills increase over evolutionary time-scales due to the formation of these structures.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178786","startPage":"2494","endPage":"2500","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178786.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of brain structure evolution in simple embodied neural agents using genetic algorithms and category theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Brain modeling","Biological neural networks","Biological cells","Neural networks","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Organisms","Neurons","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","genetic algorithms","multi-agent systems","neural nets","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain structure evolution","simple embodied neural agents","genetic algorithms","category theory","neural interconnection pattern","categorical neural semantic theory","FlatWorld","neural networks","evolutionary time-scales"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A study of brain structure evolution in simple embodied neural agents using genetic algorithms and category theory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178786/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802959","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of brain structure evolution in simple embodied neural agents using genetic algorithms and category theory","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056046S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5178791,"authors":[{"name":"Ronaldo R.

The use of wind power for producing electricity can create uncertainties in the generation. Therefore, the development of wind forecasting models is essential to integrate this kind of energy source with the generation system in an effective way. This work proposes the application of Artificial Neural Networks - ANN to produce a tool capable of accomplishing the wind speed forecasting. The ANN model is created using input data preprocessing by the Wavelet Transform - WT to extract important characteristics of the wind speed.

In the design of these systems, diversity is considered as one of the main aspects to be taken into account, since there is no gain in combining identical classification methods. One way of increasing diversity is to provide different datasets (patterns and/or attributes) for the individual classifiers. In this context, it is envisaged to use, for instance, feature selection methods in order to select subsets of attributes for the individual classifiers. However, the majority of the papers using feature selection for ensembles address the homogenous structures of ensemble, i.e., ensembles composed only of the same type of classifiers. In this paper, two approaches of genetic algorithms (single and multi-objective) will be used to guide the distribution of the features among the classifiers in the context of heterogeneous ensembles.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178793","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178793.pdf","startPage":"2784","endPage":"2791","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature selection in heterogeneous structure of ensembles: A genetic algorithm approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Feature selection in heterogeneous structure of ensembles: A genetic algorithm approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10802966","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178793/","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature selection in heterogeneous structure of ensembles: A genetic algorithm approach","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108703S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5178796,"authors":[{"name":"Andras Lorincz","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lonr\u00e1nd University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Andras","lastName":"Lorincz","id":"37318494500"},{"name":"Gabor Szirtes","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lonr\u00e1nd University, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Gabor","lastName":"Szirtes","id":"37938522400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178796","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Brain modeling","Switches","Signal processing","Event detection","State estimation","Encoding","Biological information theory","Computational modeling","Autoregressive processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","brain models","medical signal processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive model","event representation","sensory signal flow","linear hidden process","signal encoding","causal relationships","connectionist structure","parameter learning","biologically plausible rule","hippocampal formation","periodic neural activity","entorhinal cortex","spatial memory","episodic memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178796","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178796.pdf","startPage":"1885","endPage":"1892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autoregressive model of the hippocampal representation of events","abstract":"The hippocampal formation is believed to play a central role in forming long lasting representation of events. However, in contrast to the continuous nature of sensory signal flow, events are spatially and temporally bounded processes. In this paper we are interested in the kind of representation that allows for detecting and/or predicting events. Based on new results on the identification problem of linear hidden processes, we propose a general signal encoding model that can represent causal relationships used to define events. We translate the model into a connectionist structure in which parameter learning follows biologically plausible rules. We also speculate on the resemblance of the resulting structure to the connection system of the hippocampal formation. When our signal encoding model is applied on spatially anchored inputs, its different parts feature spatially localized and periodic neural activity similar to those found in the hippocampus and in the entorhinal cortex, respectively. These emergent forms of spatial activity differentiates our model from other computational models of (spatial) memory as the model has not been explicitly designed to deal with spatial information. We speculate that our model may describe the core function of the hippocampal region in forming episodic memory and supporting spatial navigation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178796/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802969","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Autoregressive model of the hippocampal representation of events","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autoregressive model of the hippocampal representation of events","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099673S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5178806,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando A.

This approach leads naturally to the design of second-order differential equations which are the mathematical models of the corresponding implementations as neural networks. Preliminary numerical simulations indicate that, on a small suite of benchmark test problems, a continuous version of the well known conjugate gradient algorithm, designed by the proposed CLF method, has better performance than its competitors, such as the heavy ball with friction method or the more recent dynamic inertial Newton-like method.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178806","startPage":"2467","endPage":"2474","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178806.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified control Liapunov function based design of neural networks that aim at global minimization of nonconvex functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178806/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unified control Liapunov function based design of neural networks that aim at global minimization of nonconvex functions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178806/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802979","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified control Liapunov function based design of neural networks that aim at global minimization of nonconvex functions","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06877S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5178812,"authors":[{"name":"Xuerui Bai","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuerui","lastName":"Bai","id":"37629628000"},{"name":"Dongbin Zhao","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongbin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277016800"},{"name":"Jianqiang Yi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianqiang","lastName":"Yi","id":"37277001200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178812","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"abstract":"This paper aims to efficiently deal with the problems of multiple ramps metering.

Second, with the learning strategy revised, the training of action network is accelerated. In order to achieve multiple ramps metering control, special performance index function is established in NFADP(lambda).

network controller for the flush material Belt Weigh Feeder","abstract":"The flush material belt weigh feeder (BWF) is used in many material handling plants. The stability and the performance of the layer control system will affect the quality of the production. In general, the behavior of the flush material on the BWF is non-linear, time-lag, and disturbance character. The layer of the flush material on the belt is hard to be stably controlled especially the occurrence of unstable situation in flush material or the Prefeeder feeding rate. This paper adopted two adaptive neural network (ANN) controller in the general PID control system to improve the performance. The proposed ANN controllers are utilized instead of the original PID controllers to deal with the problems of the unstable pheomena. This paper offers the simulation result of the material character (coarse size, moisture content) or the Prefeeder feeding rate stable and unstable condition (involve the Interference Signal) for the original and the proposed control system. The simulation results are distinct better than the original control system. The variations of the material character (coarse size, moisture content) or the Prefeeder feeding rate can be successfully predicted by the ANN controllers and adjusted the proportional actuator immediately. Finally the proposed control system remains convergence with smooth and stable. Therefore, the accuracy, stability and the performance of the control system are improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178814/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802987","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178814/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive neural network controller for the flush material Belt Weigh Feeder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive neural network controller for the flush material Belt Weigh Feeder","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055976S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5178815,"authors":[{"name":"Haruna Matsushita","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruna","lastName":"Matsushita","id":"37535041400"},{"name":"Yoshifumi Nishio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshifumi","lastName":"Nishio","id":"37270701900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178815","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Evolutionary computation","Birds","Neural networks","Measurement standards","Robustness","Convergence","Computational efficiency","Costs","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-structured particle swarm optimizer","neighborhood relationships","NS-PSO","neighborhood distance","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178815","abstract":"This study proposes a new network-structured particle swarm optimizer considering neighborhood relationships (NS-PSO).

Among survival functions, the hazard has a biological interest for the study of the disease dynamics, moreover it allows for the estimation of cumulative incidence functions for predicting outcome probabilities over follow-up. Therefore, specific error functions and data representation have been introduced for FFANN extensions of generalized linear models, in the perspective of modelling the hazard function of censored survival data.

As DNA microarray studies produce a large amount of data, expression data are highly redundant and noisy, and most genes are believed to be uninformative with respect to the studied classes. Only a fraction of genes may present distinct profiles for different classes of samples. Classification tools to deal with these issues are thus important. These tools should learn to robustly identify a subset of informative genes embedded in a large dataset that is contaminated with high dimensional noises. In this paper, an integrated approach of support vector machine (SVM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for this purpose. The proposed approach can simultaneously optimize the selection of feature subset and the classifier through a common solution coding mechanism. As an illustration, the proposed approach is applied to search the combinational gene signatures for predicting histologic response to chemotherapy of osteosarcoma patients. Cross-validation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing methods in terms of classification accuracy. Further validation using an independent dataset shows misclassification of only one out of fourteen patient samples, suggesting that the selected gene signatures can reflect the chemoresistance in osteosarcoma.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178827","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178827.pdf","startPage":"3450","endPage":"3456","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated approach of particle swarm optimization and support vector machine for gene signature selection and cancer prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An integrated approach of particle swarm optimization and support vector machine for gene signature selection and cancer prediction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10803000","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178827/","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated approach of particle swarm optimization and support vector machine for gene signature selection and cancer prediction","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128701S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5178828,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the model parameters for the mixture of Gaussian (MOG) based classifier. Since variables change in time as the human subjects walk, and likelihood score in a mixture model is usually calculated for stationary data, a scoring system is developed to calculate how likely a time sequence of variables belongs to a particular distribution. A neural network (NN) based classifier is also developed which uses the traditional back-propagation algorithm for training. The results obtained show overall 74.1% accuracy using MOG and 66.4% using NN for the test set in a binary classification task of detecting ldquoloadrdquo or ldquono-loadrdquo conditions using just two variables. The lower accuracy using NN is not surprising as averaged variables are provided as inputs to the NN while MOG is able to use the dynamic information. In another classification task with four classes and using two variables, the accuracy was 37.2% using MOG and 34.2% using NN on the test set which are both better than chance. Accuracy of NN using 7 variables was 81.4% for binary classification and 41.3% for four-class classification. An interesting finding from these results is that NN (using 7 averaged variables) performed better than human perceivers who were asked to judge based on stick figure animations of subjects walking. Another interesting revelation from this study was that the covariance matrices from the MOG model revealed ldquoanti-phaserdquo locking of the elbow and stoop angle as the subjects walk.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178828","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1053","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178828.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting load conditions in human walking using expectation maximization and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Legged locomotion","Neural networks","Optical computing","Testing","Elbow","Image motion analysis","Image segmentation","Skin","Motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","gait analysis","Gaussian processes","image classification","image motion analysis","image segmentation","image sequences","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load condition detection","human walking","expectation maximization algorithm","neural network training","weight carrying condition","Gaussian mixture-based classifier","model parameter learning","time sequence","back-propagation algorithm","binary classification task","gait analysis human","human motion segment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detecting load conditions in human walking using expectation maximization and neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178828/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10803001","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting load conditions in human walking using expectation maximization and neural networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09958S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5178834,"authors":[{"name":"Yongtao Li","affiliation":["School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yongtao","lastName":"Li","id":"37695844100"},{"name":"Shuhei Kurata","affiliation":["School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuhei","lastName":"Kurata","id":"37700597900"},{"name":"Ryosuke Yoshinaka","affiliation":["School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryosuke","lastName":"Yoshinaka","id":"37991169800"},{"name":"Shigetoshi Nara","affiliation":["School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigetoshi","lastName":"Nara","id":"37265403300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178834","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Recurrent neural networks","Information processing","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neurons","Process control","Biological control systems","Biological neural networks","Control systems","Biological systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale systems","mobile robots","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic dynamics","quasi-layered recurrent neural network","complex control","sensory neurons","motor neurons","roving robot"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178834","abstract":"In this paper, chaotic dynamics in quasi-layered recurrent neural network model (QLRNNM), consisting of sensory neurons and motor neurons, is applied to solving ill-posed problems.

The neural network receiver has adaptive learning ability and outperforms the correlation receiver under various noise conditions, especially in the situation of non-white noise as well as the real world noise taken from actual drilling sites.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178838","startPage":"3360","endPage":"3364","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178838.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network receiver for EM-MWD baseband communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Baseband","Additive white noise","Gaussian noise","AWGN","Artificial neural networks","Digital communication","Noise measurement","Frequency","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","digital communication","drilling","learning (artificial intelligence)","measurement systems","neural nets","production engineering computing","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network receiver","EM-MWD baseband communication systems","baseband digital communication","electromagnetic measurement","drilling systems","surface noise","correlation receiver","additive white Gaussian noise","spectral peaks","artificial neural network","adaptive learning","noise conditions","nonwhite noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A neural network receiver for EM-MWD baseband communication systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178838/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10803011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network receiver for EM-MWD baseband communication systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042325S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5178845,"authors":[{"name":"Shogo Okada","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shogo","lastName":"Okada","id":"37287036400"},{"name":"Toyoaki Nishida","affiliation":["Department of Intelligence Science and Technology, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Toyoaki","lastName":"Nishida","id":"37287482300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178845","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178845","abstract":"This paper describes an incremental unsupervised clustering mechanism for sequence patterns arising from human gestures. Although self-organizing incremental neural network (SOINN) is known as a powerful tool for incremental unsupervised clustering, it is only applicable to static and fixed-length patterns. In this paper, we propose an extension to SOINN to handle dynamic sequence patterns of variable length. We use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), as a pre-processor for SOINN, to map the variable-length patterns into fixed-length patterns. HMM contributes to robust feature extraction from sequence patterns, enabling similar statistical features to be extracted from sequence patterns of the same category. As a result of experiments with incremental clustering gesture data, we have found that HMM based SOINN (HB-SOINN) outperforms other methods.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178845","startPage":"2316","endPage":"2322","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178845.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental clustering of gesture patterns based on a self organizing incremental neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Organizing","Neural networks","Hidden Markov models","Humans","Pattern recognition","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Motion analysis","Character generation","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data reduction","gesture recognition","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gesture pattern recognition","incremental unsupervised clustering mechanism","self organizing incremental neural network","dynamic sequence pattern","hidden Markov Model","variable-length pattern","fixed-length pattern","unsupervised learning","sequence data dimension reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Incremental clustering of gesture patterns based on a self organizing incremental neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178845/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10803018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental clustering of gesture patterns based on a self organizing incremental neural network","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07512S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5178849,"authors":[{"name":"Rita Lovassy","affiliation":["Inst. of Information Technology,Mechanical and Electrical Eng., Szechenyi Istvan University, Gyor, Hungary"],"firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Lovassy","id":"37547948300"},{"name":"Laszlo T.

The new field of research on autonomous development must enable machines to develop intelligent behaviors that respond not only to spatial features, but also temporal features. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has a probability based mechanism to deal with time warping, but no effective online method exists that can deal with general temporal structure and temporal abstraction. By online, we mean that the agent must respond to spatial and temporal context immediately while the sensory stream flows in. By general temporal context, we mean various desirable temporal subsets, such as deletion (e.g., stop words) and variable temporal lengths (e.g., beyond bigrams and trigrams). By temporal abstraction, we mean using abstract meaning of context, instead of concrete forms. This paper proposes a brain inspired online scheme for making sequential decisions based on general temporal context. By sequential decisions, the action from the network depends on not only inputs and outputs but also emergent internal context states. In our neuromorphic scheme, the internal states are not predefined symbols, but distributed context depending on the internal attention. Our complexity analysis shows how this scheme greatly reduces the exponential time complexity O(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sup>\n) of all the possible number of contexts of length t down to linear time complexity O(cnt), where n is the number of neurons in the network and c is the average number of synapses of each neuron.

A novel efficient, non-invasive, on-line artificial neural network approach to two-phase flow regime identification is put forward; the general regression architecture has been employed. Through the utilization of a single input expressing the mean intensity of each image, satisfactory identification of the flow regime of sequences of images from neutron radiography coolant flow videos is accomplished. The proposed approach is not only more computationally efficient than existing conventional signal processing techniques and computational intelligence methodologies, but also - at worst - comparable to them in terms of identification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178869","startPage":"3082","endPage":"3087","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178869.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General regression artificial neural networks for two-phase flow regime identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neutrons","Radiography","Coolants","Computational intelligence","Pixel","Monitoring","Computer architecture","Video signal processing","Helium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow","image sequences","neural nets","neutron radiography","nuclear engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general regression artificial neural network","two-phase flow regime identification","nuclear monitoring","online artificial neural network","regression architecture","image sequence","neutron radiography coolant flow video","signal processing","computational intelligence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"General regression artificial neural networks for two-phase flow regime identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178869/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10803042","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General regression artificial neural networks for two-phase flow regime identification","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100237S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5178874,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37535872500"},{"name":"Haibo He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"He","id":"37291665900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178874","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":559},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Streaming media","Predictive models","Intrusion detection","Learning systems","Neural networks","Helium","Costs","Training data","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","probability","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SERA","selectively recursive approach","nonstationary imbalanced stream data mining","class distribution","concept drift","current training data chunk","sampling probability","imbalanced data stream"]}],"abstract":"Recent years have witnessed an incredibly increasing interest in the topic of stream data mining. Despite the great success having been achieved, current approaches generally assume that the class distribution of the stream data is relatively balanced. However, in applications such as network intrusion detection, credit fraud detection, spam classification, and many others, the class distribution is mostly imbalanced and the cost for misclassifying a minority example is very expensive. Concept drifts is an unavoidable issue for stream data mining research, which is even more difficult to handle when the classifier has to learn from an imbalanced data stream whose target concept keeps drifting all the time. In this article, we propose a selectively recursive approach (SERA) to deal with the problem of learning from nonstationary imbalanced data streams. By selectively absorbing the previously received minority examples into the current training data chunk and potentially assigning the sampling probabilities proportionally to the majority and minority examples, SERA can alleviate the difficulty confronted by the conventional stream data mining methods when they have to learn from the nonstationary imbalanced data streams. Experiments performed on the synthetic datasets show that compared to the existing approaches, our approach is competitive in the general assessment metrics and is capable of significantly performance improvement in predicting minority instances.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178874","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178874.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178874","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"522","endPage":"529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SERA: Selectively recursive approach towards nonstationary imbalanced stream data mining","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178874","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"SERA: Selectively recursive approach towards nonstationary imbalanced stream data mining","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178874/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178874/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10803047","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SERA: Selectively recursive approach towards nonstationary imbalanced stream data mining","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080699S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5178883,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Basically, they try to find information occurring in the incoming data using the concept of granules and T-S neurons as basic processing elements. The main characteristics of eGNN models are continuous learning, self-organization, and adaptation to unknown environments. Association rules and parameters can be easily extracted from its structure at any step during the evolving process. The rule base gives a granular description of the behavior of the system in the input space together with the associated classes.

This paper deals with the state observation problem when the dynamic model of a plant contains uncertainties or is completely unknown and it is oriented to discrete time nonlinear systems because most of the existent results have been developed for continous time systems. The recurrent neural network (RNN) have shown his advantages to deal with this class problem.

FPGAs are widely used for implementing high performance digital hardware systems, due to its flexibility and because they are suitable for the implementation of systems with high degree of parallelism. FPGAs have become an important tool because fine grain digital elements useful for efficient hardware implementation of SNNs are provided, making FPGA device suitable for implementing SNNs. Several attempts for implementing efficient classifiers in hardware have been done, but most of them fail because the processing elements are costly in terms of hardware resource utilization. SNNs are less hardware greedy, and the nature of the pulsed processing is well suited to the digital processing blocks of the FPGA devices. In this work, a hardware architecture for implementing both recall and learning phases required for Multilayer FeedForward SNNs is proposed.

Using artificial neural networks architectures - Self Organizing Maps and (Fuzzy) Learning Vector Quantization, it was possible to understand the data space and to build models able to recognize hand movements performed for one or more than one specific Libras users.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handicapped aids","Neural networks","Deafness","Artificial neural networks","Mathematical model","Self organizing feature maps","Fuzzy neural networks","Vector quantization","Physics computing","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","handicapped aids","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural languages","self-organising feature maps","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Brazilian sign language","vision-based hand movement recognition","distance-based artificial neural network","neural-fuzzy model","self organizing map","learning vector quantization","Libras user"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178917","startPage":"697","endPage":"704","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178917.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hand movement recognition for Brazilian Sign Language: A study using distance-based neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hand movement recognition for Brazilian Sign Language: A study using distance-based neural networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10803090","publicationDate":"June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178917/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hand movement recognition for Brazilian Sign Language: A study using distance-based neural networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119071S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5178918,"authors":[{"name":"Beatriz A.

Due to the efficiency and adaptability of bio-inspired algorithms, in this paper we explore a new way to design an artificial neural network (ANN). For this task, a modified PSO algorithm was used. We do not only study the problem of finding the optimal synaptic weights of an ANN but also its topology and transfer functions. In other words, given a set of inputs and desired patterns, with the proposal we are able to find the best topology, the number of neurons, the transfer function for each neuron, as well as the synaptic weights. This allows to designing an ANN to be used to solve a given problem. The proposal is tested using several non-linear problems.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178918","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178918.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178918","startPage":"938","endPage":"945","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of artificial neural networks using a modified Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178918/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10803091","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of artificial neural networks using a modified Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060354S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5178926,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo S.

In this article, we are interested in the forecast of the time series related to the Brazilian oil company, Petrobras (PETR4). A methodology based on information obtained from exogenous series was used in combination with a neural network to predict the PETR4 stock series. Exogenous series were selected by analyzing the correlation between the series with the Petrobras stocks series. In this way, the prediction was obtained by not just using the previous values of the series but also by using information external to the PETR4 series. The values of the selected series were used as features for a prediction stage based on combined neural networks. To evaluate the performance of the system classical measurements were used, however we also introduce a new performance index called Sum of the Losses and Gains (SLG).","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178949","startPage":"149","endPage":"156","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178949.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Financial time series prediction using exogenous series and combined neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Weather forecasting","Economic forecasting","Meteorology","Demography","Finance","Stock markets","Petroleum","Performance loss","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","stock markets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["financial time series prediction","time series forecasting","combined neural networks","stock market","Brazilian oil company","exogenous series","Petrobras","PETR4"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Financial time series prediction using exogenous series and combined neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178949/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802602","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Financial time series prediction using exogenous series and combined neural networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061571S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5178950,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Gasca","affiliation":["Divisi\u00f3n de Estudiosde Posgrado e Investigaci\u00f3n, Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Toluca, Mexico, Mexico"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Gasca","id":"37991191400"},{"name":"Juan H.

Neural networks fit provide a potential energy surface through a function approximation for a data distribution of high dispersion; hence a binding energy is found with this methodology.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178950","startPage":"946","endPage":"952","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178950.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for fitting PES data distributions of asphaltene interaction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178950/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for fitting PES data distributions of asphaltene interaction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178950/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802603","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for fitting PES data distributions of asphaltene interaction","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076178S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5178952,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Inoue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37405926100"},{"name":"Yoshifumi Nishio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshifumi","lastName":"Nishio","id":"37270701900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178952","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178952","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Cellular neural networks","Biomembranes","Neurons","In vitro","Neuromorphics","Extracellular","Neural networks","Neural network hardware","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","image colour analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color image processing","three-layer cellular neural network","HSB model","color images","grayscale images"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178952","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178952.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"1335","endPage":"1342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of color image processing using three-layer cellular neural network considering HSB model","abstract":"In this study, we propose a three-layer cellular neural network dealing with color images considering the HSB model.

However, few of these techniques have the capability to deal with variable noise rate in the predictions over the domain, making the assumptions about the reliability of these outputs become not suitable with their real accuracy. In this paper an extension to the non-linear regression method to estimate prediction intervals for feed forward neural networks is presented. The main idea of this method is that residuals variance should be estimated in function of the input data and not as a constant. Thus, using clustering techniques, distinct estimates of the residuals variance are made and then used to obtain new prediction intervals. Proceeding in this manner, the experiments results show that this approach can lead to prediction intervals that better reflect the confidence level of the neural network outputs.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178953","startPage":"2238","endPage":"2242","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178953.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method to estimate prediction intervals for artificial neural networks that is sensitive to the noise distribution in the outputs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Predictive models","Training data","Feedforward neural networks","Mathematical model","Feeds","Forward contracts","Medical services","Biomedical equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["prediction intervals estimation","artificial neural networks","noise distribution","mathematical models","feedforward neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A method to estimate prediction intervals for artificial neural networks that is sensitive to the noise distribution in the outputs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178953/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802606","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method to estimate prediction intervals for artificial neural networks that is sensitive to the noise distribution in the outputs","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089549S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5178954,"authors":[{"name":"Masakazu Kawahara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Masakazu","lastName":"Kawahara","id":"37409876300"},{"name":"Takashi Inoue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Inoue","id":"37405926100"},{"name":"Yoshifumi Nishio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshifumi","lastName":"Nishio","id":"37270701900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178954","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Biological neural networks","Image processing","Neural networks","Learning systems","Computer simulation","Nonlinear equations","Animal structures","Neurons","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural network","learning method","image processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178954","abstract":"In this research, we propose cellular neural network with dynamic template.

The use of CopfRopf calculus provides a convenient framework for the calculation of gradients of real functions of complex variables (cost functions) which do not obey the Cauchy-Riemann conditions. Further, the analysis is based on so called augmented complex statistics, to provide a rigorous treatment of complex noncircularity and nonlinearity, thus avoiding the deficiencies inherent in several mathematical shortcuts typically used in the treatment of complex random signals. The complex models addressed in this work, are based on widely linear nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA) models and are shown to be suitable for processing the generality of complex signals, both second order circular (proper) and noncircular (improper).","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178960","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178960.pdf","startPage":"1987","endPage":"1992","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex valued recurrent neural networks for noncircular complex signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Complex valued recurrent neural networks for noncircular complex signals","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10802613","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5178960/","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex valued recurrent neural networks for noncircular complex signals","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06852S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5178969,"authors":[{"name":"Ryanne Dolan","affiliation":["Ryanne Dolan and Guilherme DeSouza, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Ryanne","lastName":"Dolan","id":"37603419400"},{"name":"Guilherme DeSouza","affiliation":["Ryanne Dolan and Guilherme DeSouza, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Guilherme","lastName":"DeSouza","id":"37283031900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5178969","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular neural networks","Image processing","Parallel processing","Concurrent computing","Software libraries","Computational modeling","Computer networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","coprocessors","data visualisation","digital simulation","image processing","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-based simulation","cellular neural networks","kernel-based algorithms","GPU abstraction","parallel computation","image processing library","visualization software"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5178969","abstract":"The inherent massive parallelism of cellular neural networks makes them an ideal computational platform for kernel-based algorithms and image processing.

Most of the previous work on CNN, employed fixed parameters or learning methods which need many iterations of an algorithm. There is a lack of fast, online and robust training method in the field of cellular neural networks. The learning method presented in this paper is a modified online backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The modification is concerned with adding a damping term which enhances the robustness of the training scheme. Another modification is decrease the learning rate to avoid unwanted oscillations. To evaluate the performance of the training scheme a set of simulations are performed on two-dimensional heat conduction problem. The results obtained by using CNN are compared to those of analytic solutions.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178972","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05178972.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing a training methodology for cellular neural networks solving partial differential equations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5178972/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Introducing a training methodology for cellular neural networks solving partial differential equations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5178972/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802625","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing a training methodology for cellular neural networks solving partial differential equations","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0539.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07857S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5178972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5178977,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni E.

The architecture combines techniques from circuit switching and packet switching to provide two different service classes: isochronous connections and best-effort packet transfers. The isochronous connections are able to transport the axonal data of artificial neurons between VLSI ANN models that feature a speedup of multiples orders of magnitudes compared to biology. The connections use reserved bandwidth to provide loss-less transmissions as well as a low end-to-end delay with bounded jitter. Best-effort packet transfers use the remaining bandwidth for on-demand multi-purpose communication. The data forwarding is performed between synchronized instances of a dedicated switch architecture used at each network node. The switch is scalable in terms of port numbers and line speed. Its low complexity allows for an implementation within programmable logic or directly within a VLSI neural network chip. A reference implementation of the proposed network architecture is presented within an existing framework that hosts VLSI neural network chips operating at speedups of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup>\n.

This approach is based on adaptive multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network and sliding mode technique. The aim of this study is to design a robust controller with respect to external disturbances in order to improve the trajectory tracking. In fact, an adaptive MLP neural network is developed to estimate the gravitational force, frictions and other dynamics. To overcome the non-linearity problem presented in the neural network, we used the Taylor series expansion. The control law combining a neural network and sliding mode is synthesized in order to attract states model to the sliding surface. All adaptation laws of neural parameters and sliding mode term are based on the stability of the closed loop system in the Lyapunov sense. This approach has been implemented on a C5 parallel robot, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in presence of external disturbances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5179031/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802729","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5179031/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combined multi-layer perceptron neural network and sliding mode technique for parallel robots control : An adaptive approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined multi-layer perceptron neural network and sliding mode technique for parallel robots control : An adaptive approach","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079976S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5179031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5179034,"authors":[{"name":"Richard L.

The RBFDO's are employed to monitor the modeling errors and external disturbances, etc. And on-line tuning rules for updating the weights of the RBFDO's are designed based on the e1-modification algorithm. Meanwhile, by considering the dynamics of the Stewart platform and its voice coil actuators, the developed RBFDO's are integrated with the backstepping method to design the active vibration isolation controller. In the presence of external vibrations and model uncertainties, the uniformly ultimately boundedness of the stabilization errors and the weight estimation errors can be guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the proposed controller can effectively attenuate external low-frequency vibrations in six DOFs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5179041/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802739","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5179041/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network disturbance observer based controller of an electrically driven stewart platform using backstepping for active vibration isolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network disturbance observer based controller of an electrically driven stewart platform using backstepping for active vibration isolation","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055041S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5179041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5179043,"authors":[{"name":"Jayram Moorkanikara Nageswaran","affiliation":["Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jayram Moorkanikara","lastName":"Nageswaran","id":"37569762300"},{"name":"Nikil Dutt","affiliation":["Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nikil","lastName":"Dutt","id":"37265889400"},{"name":"Jeffrey L.

Spiking neural network (SNN) simulators have been traditionally simulated on large-scale clusters, super-computers, or on dedicated hardware architectures. Alternatively, graphics processing units (GPUs) can provide a low-cost, programmable, and high-performance computing platform for simulation of SNNs. In this paper we demonstrate an efficient, Izhikevich neuron based large-scale SNN simulator that runs on a single GPU. The GPU-SNN model (running on an NVIDIA GTX-280 with 1 GB of memory), is up to 26 times faster than a CPU version for the simulation of 100 K neurons with 50 million synaptic connections, firing at an average rate of 7 Hz. For simulation of 100 K neurons with 10 million synaptic connections, the GPU-SNN model is only 1.5 times slower than real-time. Further, we present a collection of new techniques related to parallelism extraction, mapping of irregular communication, and compact network representation for effective simulation of SNNs on GPUs. The fidelity of the simulation results were validated against CPU simulations using firing rate, synaptic weight distribution, and inter-spike interval analysis. We intend to make our simulator available to the modeling community so that researchers will have easy access to large-scale SNN simulations.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179043","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05179043.pdf","startPage":"2145","endPage":"2152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient simulation of large-scale Spiking Neural Networks using CUDA graphics processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5179043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5179043/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient simulation of large-scale Spiking Neural Networks using CUDA graphics processors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802741","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5179043/","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient simulation of large-scale Spiking Neural Networks using CUDA graphics processors","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0633.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088432S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5179043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5179045,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, and School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering and ICT Research Institute, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37716102400"},{"name":"Abdesselam Bouzerdoum","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, and School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering and ICT Research Institute, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Abdesselam","lastName":"Bouzerdoum","id":"37275455900"},{"name":"Son Lam Phung","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering, and School of Electrical, Computer and Telecommunications Engineering and ICT Research Institute, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia"],"firstName":"Son Lam","lastName":"Phung","id":"37275456900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5179045","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5179045","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Sampling methods","Neurons","Network topology","Computer architecture","Iterative algorithms","Computational complexity","Computational efficiency","Performance analysis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","neural net architecture","signal representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network pruning approach","compressive sampling theory","computational complexity","saliency analysis","compressed sensing theory","sparse signal representation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179045","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05179045.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"3428","endPage":"3435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network pruning approach based on Compressive Sampling","abstract":"The balance between computational complexity and the architecture bottlenecks the development of neural networks (NNs).

In management, NN have shown only inferior performance on well established benchmark time series of monthly, quarterly or annual frequency. In contrast, NN have shown preeminent accuracy in electrical load forecasting on daily or hourly time series, leading to successful real life applications. While this inconsistency has been traditionally attributed to the lack of a reliable methodology to model NNs, recent research indicates that the particular data properties of high frequency time series may be equally important. High frequency time series of daily, hourly or even shorter time intervals pose additional modelling challenges in the length and structure of the time series, which may abet the use of novel methods. This analysis aims to identify and contrast the challenges in modelling NN for low and high frequency data in order to develop a unifying forecasting methodology tailored to the properties of the dataset. We conduct a set of experiments in three different frequency domains of daily, weekly and monthly data of one empirical time series of cash machine withdrawals, using a consistent modelling procedure. While our analysis provides evidence that NN are suitable to predict high frequency data, it also identifies a set of challenges in modelling NN that arise from high frequency data, in particular in specifying the input vector, and that require specific modelling approaches applicable to both low and high frequency data.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179046","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05179046.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"626","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Input-variable specification for Neural Networks - An analysis of forecasting low and high time series frequency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5179046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Input-variable specification for Neural Networks - An analysis of forecasting low and high time series frequency","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10802744","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5179046/","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input-variable specification for Neural Networks - An analysis of forecasting low and high time series frequency","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09523S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5179046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5179049,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Schliebs","affiliation":["Knowledge Engineer and Discovery Research Institute (KEDRI), Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Schliebs","id":"37660767400"},{"name":"Michael Defoin Platel","affiliation":["Biomathematics and Bioinformatics, Rothamsted Research, UK"],"firstName":"Michael Defoin","lastName":"Platel","id":"37660771100"},{"name":"Sue Worner","affiliation":["Centre for Bio Protection, Lincoln University, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Sue","lastName":"Worner","id":"37694779100"},{"name":"Nikola Kasabov","affiliation":["Knowledge Engineer and Discovery Research Institute (KEDRI), Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Kasabov","id":"37268483000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5179049","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ecology","evolutionary computation","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum-inspired feature optimisation","parameter optimisation","evolving spiking neural networks","ecological modeling","integrated connectionist system","quantum representation","quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm","ecological data modeling problem","naive Bayesian classifier"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum-inspired feature and parameter optimisation of evolving spiking neural networks with a case study from ecological modeling","abstract":"The paper introduces a framework and implementation of an integrated connectionist system, where the features and the parameters of an evolving spiking neural network are optimised together using a quantum representation of the features and a quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm for optimisation.

The ANN showed to be more accurate and give more return to the investor than the four benchmarks. The best results obtained by the ANN had an mean absolute percentage error around 50% smaller than the best benchmark, and doubled the capital of the investor.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179050","startPage":"2006","endPage":"2013","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05179050.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From an artificial neural network to a stock market day-trading system: A case study on the BM&F BOVESPA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5179050/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"From an artificial neural network to a stock market day-trading system: A case study on the BM&F BOVESPA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5179050/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10802748","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From an artificial neural network to a stock market day-trading system: A case study on the BM&F BOVESPA","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0642.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102098S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5179050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5179060,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Cleaver","affiliation":["Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Cleaver","id":"37996644100"},{"name":"Ganesh Kumar Venayagamoorthy","affiliation":["Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Ganesh Kumar","lastName":"Venayagamoorthy","id":"37273360200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5179060","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5179060","abstract":"In this paper, nonlinear functions generated by randomly initialized multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and simultaneous recurrent neural networks (SRNs) are learned by MLPs and SRNs.

The results from DEPSO are compared with the standard backpropagation (BP) and PSO algorithms. It is further verified that functions generated by SRNs are harder to learn than those generated by MLPs but DEPSO provides better learning capabilities for the functions generated by MLPs and SRNs as compared to BP and PSO.

Through SpiNNaker, a dedicated neural chip multiprocessor, we introduce a real-time modelling architecture that makes the neural model run on the device independent of the hardware specifics. The central features of this modelling architecture are: native concurrency, ability to support very large (Gt 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">9</sup>\n neurons) networks, and decoupling of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the model from those of the hardware. It circumvents a virtually fatal tradeoff in large-scale neural hardware between model support limitations or scalability limitations, without imposing a synchronous timing model. The chip itself combines an array of general-purpose processors with a configurable asynchronous interconnect and memory fabric to achieve true on- and off-chip parallelism, universal network architecture support, and programmable temporal dynamics. An HDL-like concurrent configuration software model using libraries of templates, allows the user to embed the neural model onto the hardware, mapping the virtual network structure and time dynamics into physical on-chip components and delay specifications. Initial modelling experiments demonstrate the ability of the processor to support real-time neural processing using 2 different neural models. The complete system is therefore an environment able, within a wide range of model characteristics, to model real-time dynamic neural network behaviour on dedicated hardware.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179067","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05179067.pdf","startPage":"2611","endPage":"2618","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A universal abstract-time platform for real-time neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5179067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A universal abstract-time platform for real-time neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10802765","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5179067/","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A universal abstract-time platform for real-time neural networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0664.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13485S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5179067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5179069,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Saito","affiliation":["Department of Physics, College of Humanities & Sciences, Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Saito","id":"37891501100"},{"name":"Katsutoshi Saeki","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Science, College of Science & Technology, Nihon University, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsutoshi","lastName":"Saeki","id":"37862518800"},{"name":"Yoshifumi Sekine","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Science, College of Science & Technology, Nihon University, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshifumi","lastName":"Sekine","id":"37346983700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5179069","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5179069","abstract":"It is well known that locomotion rhythms of living organisms are generated by CPG (central pattern generator). In this paper, we discuss the synchronization phenomena and oscillation patterns of the coupled oscillators system using pulse-type hardware neuron models (P-HNMs) for the purpose of constructing the CPG model. It is shown that the plural coupled P-HNMs connected by excitatory-inhibitory mutual coupling can generate various oscillation patterns. Therefore, we construct the CPG model by using the coupled P-HNMs to generate several locomotion rhythms. As a result, we show clearly that the IC chip of CPG model, which can generate the quadruped locomotion patterns, can be constructed by CMOS process.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179069","startPage":"2748","endPage":"2755","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05179069.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of coupled pulse-type hardware neuron models for CPG model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Neurons","Rhythm","Mutual coupling","Semiconductor device modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Organisms","Oscillators","CMOS integrated circuits","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled pulse-type hardware neuron model","central pattern generator","locomotion rhythm","synchronization phenomena","oscillation pattern","coupled oscillators system","excitatory-inhibitory mutual coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5179069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of coupled pulse-type hardware neuron models for CPG model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5179069/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802767","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of coupled pulse-type hardware neuron models for CPG model","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069235S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5179069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5179071,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Arif","affiliation":["Control and Power Research group, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Arif","id":"37588475800"},{"name":"Nilanjan Ray Chaudhuri","affiliation":["Control and Power Research group, Imperial College London, SW7 2BT, UK"],"firstName":"Nilanjan","lastName":"Ray Chaudhuri","id":"37085887550"},{"name":"Swakshar Ray","affiliation":["Power Technology Department, ABB Corporate Research Center, Vasteras, Sweden"],"firstName":"Swakshar","lastName":"Ray","id":"37381149800"},{"name":"Balarko Chaudhuri","affiliation":["Control and Power Research group, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Balarko","lastName":"Chaudhuri","id":"37272488000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3548-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3553-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"5179071","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":610},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system control","Neural networks","Control systems","Power systems","Resonance light scattering","Power system dynamics","Neurofeedback","Linear feedback control systems","Least squares methods","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","convergence of numerical methods","feedback","learning (artificial intelligence)","learning systems","least squares approximations","linearisation techniques","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","nonlinear estimation","power system control","recursive estimation","self-adjusting systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","neural network","power system dynamic behavior control","off-line batch training method","feedback linearization framework","nonlinear self-tuning control","closed-loop system","recursive least square approach","RLS","convergence","linear estimation","nonlinear estimation","sliding window mode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Damping","Levenberg-Marquardt","Power system oscillations","Self-tuning controller","Feedback linearization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5179071","abstract":"Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, a powerful off-line batch training method for neural networks, is adapted here for online estimation of power system dynamic behavior.

It presents a multilayer perceptron (MLP) based media access control protocol (MAC) to secure a CSMA-based wireless sensor network against the denial-of-service attacks launched by adversaries. The MLP enhances the security of a WSN by constantly monitoring the parameters that exhibit unusual variations in case of an attack. The MLP shuts down the MAC layer and the physical layer of the sensor node when the suspicion factor, the output of the MLP, exceeds a preset threshold level. Backpropagation and particle swarm optimization algorithms are used for training the MLP. The MLP-guarded secure WSN is implemented using the Vanderbilt Prowler simulator.

SRN training is a difficult problem especially if multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) are involved. Particle swarm optimization with quantum infusion (PSO-QI) is introduced in this paper for training such SRNs. In order to illustrate the capability of the PSO-QI training algorithm, a wide area monitor (WAM) for a power system is developed using a multiple inputs multiple outputs Elman SRN. The SRN estimates speed deviations of four generators in a multimachine power system. Since MIMO structured SRNs are hard to train, a two step approach for training is presented with PSO-QI. The performance of PSO-QI is compared to that of the standard PSO algorithm. Results demonstrate that the SRN trained with the PSO-QI in the two step approach tracks the speed deviations of the generators with the minimum error.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179082","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1930","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5161636/5178557/05179082.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5179082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5178557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PSO with quantum infusion algorithm for training Simultaneous Recurrent Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","MIMO","Power systems","Neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Time varying systems","Particle swarm optimization","Monitoring","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","MIMO systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear dynamical systems","particle swarm optimisation","quantum computing","recurrent neural nets","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO","quantum infusion algorithm","simultaneous recurrent neural networks training","time varying nonlinear dynamic system control","multiple input and multiple output","particle swarm optimization","wide area monitor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5179082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A PSO with quantum infusion algorithm for training Simultaneous Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5179082/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10802780","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PSO with quantum infusion algorithm for training Simultaneous Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08417S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5161636","isNumber":"5178557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5161636","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5178557","articleId":"5179082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
