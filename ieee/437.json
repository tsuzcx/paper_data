The sampling method depends on sample distribution. HSC can directly solve the nonlinear multi-class classification problems and observe the sample distribution. The sample distribution is obtained by adaptively dividing the sample space, and the classification model of hyper surface is directly used to classify large database based on Jordan curve theorem in topology while sampling for MCSC. The number of MCSC is calculated. MCSC has the same classification model with the entire sample set and can totally reflect its classification ability. For any subset of the sample set that contains MCSC, the classification ability remains the same. Moreover, a formula is put forward that can predict the testing accuracy exactly when some samples are deleted from MCSC. So MCSC is the best way of sampling from the original sample set for Hyper Surface Classification method.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370107","startPage":"12","endPage":"18","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370104/04370107.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Based on Minimal Consistent Subset for Hyper Surface Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Based on Minimal Consistent Subset for Hyper Surface Classification","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4370107/","accessionNumber":"9797237","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370107/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Based on Minimal Consistent Subset for Hyper Surface Classification","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-1-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041417S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4370104","articleId":"4370107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4370108,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Guo","affiliation":["School of Math, Stat. & Computer Science, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, Japan"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085533987"},{"name":"Junbin Gao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Junbin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37405510700"},{"name":"Paul W.

To address this, we propose constrained TKE, which is an OOS extension of TKE capable of learning such a mapping function. This is achieved by including the mapping in the objective function optimized by the TKE algorithm. More broadly, this mapping function can be applied in other data reduction methods as an OOS extension. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of predictions in case where new samples are presented in batch, a refinement strategy is introduced by exploiting the similarity between new samples which is often ignored by other methods. Experimental results on the Reuters-21578 text collection confirmed the usefulness of the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Machine learning","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data reduction","data visualisation","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["out-of sample mapping learning","nonvectorial data reduction","constrained twin kernel embedding","data clustering","data visualization","manifold learning","DNA","protein sequences","biometric features","objective function","Reuters-21578 text collection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dimensionality reduction","TKE","Out-Of-Sample"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370108","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370104/04370108.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Out-Of Sample Mapping in Non-Vectorial Data Reduction using Constrained Twin Kernel Embedding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370108","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning Out-Of Sample Mapping in Non-Vectorial Data Reduction using Constrained Twin Kernel Embedding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370108/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4370108/","accessionNumber":"9797164","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Out-Of Sample Mapping in Non-Vectorial Data Reduction using Constrained Twin Kernel Embedding","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-1-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057557S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","xplore-issue":"4370104","articleId":"4370108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4370129,"authors":[{"name":"Pawalai Kraipeerapun","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Pawalai","lastName":"Kraipeerapun","id":"37267334900"},{"name":"Chun Che Fung","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Chun Che","lastName":"Fung","id":"37396285700"},{"name":"Kok Wai Wong","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Kok Wai","lastName":"Wong","id":"37335649600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370129","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370129","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Intelligent networks","Channel hot electron injection","Information technology","Australia","Electronic mail","Feedforward systems","Backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vagueness quantification","multiclass classification problem","multiple binary neural networks","one-against-one neural networks","interval neutrosophic sets","indeterminacy membership values","decision making","training data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiclass classification","Feed-forward backpropagation neural network","Vagueness"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370129","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370104/04370129.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","startPage":"140","endPage":"144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantification of Vagueness in Multiclass Classification Based on Multiple Binary Neural Networks","abstract":"This paper presents an innovative approach to solve the problem of multiclass classification. One-against-one neural networks are applied to interval neutrosophic sets (INS). INS associates a set of truth, false and indeterminacy membership values with an output. Multiple pairs of the truth binary neural network and the false binary neural network are trained to predict multiple pairs of the truth and false membership values. The difference between each pair of truth and false membership values is considered as vagueness in the classification and formed as the indeterminacy membership value. The three memberships obtained from each pair of networks constitute an interval neutrosophic set. Multiple interval neutrosophic sets are then created and used to support decision making in multiclass classification. We have applied our technique to three classical benchmark problems including balance, wine, and yeast from the UCI machine learning repository. Our approach has improved classification performance compared to an existing one-against-one technique which applies only to the truth membership values.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370129/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797761","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4370129/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quantification of Vagueness in Multiclass Classification Based on Multiple Binary Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantification of Vagueness in Multiclass Classification Based on Multiple Binary Neural Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-1-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048297S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4370104","articleId":"4370129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4370155,"authors":[{"name":"Su-Nan Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Su-Nan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37965035800"},{"name":"Jian-Gang Yang","affiliation":["Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Gang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37559192200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370155","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1154},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370155","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision trees","Manufacturing","Artificial intelligence","Machine learning","Drugs","Customer profiles","Computerized monitoring","Space technology","Agriculture","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["banking","consumer protection","decision trees","risk analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["money laundering risk evaluation","decision tree","drug trafficking","organized crime","commercial bank","anti-money laundering system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-money laundering","Decision tree","Commercial bank"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370155","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370104/04370155.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Money Laundering Risk Evaluation Method Based on Decision Tree","abstract":"Money laundering (ML) involves moving illicit funds, which may be linked to drug trafficking or organized crime, through a series of transactions or accounts to disguise origin or ownership.

The chaotic inertia weight PSO using logistic mapping performs little better than that using tent mapping.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370164/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797091","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4370164/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparing with Chaotic Inertia Weights in Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing with Chaotic Inertia Weights in Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-1-60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077477S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4370104","articleId":"4370164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4370165,"authors":[{"name":"Zong-Min Qiao","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zong-Min","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37955172900"},{"name":"Jia-Xing Cheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jia-Xing","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37439088400"},{"name":"Jie Song","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Song","id":"37832885500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370165","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Neural networks","Neurons","Linear matrix inequalities","Sufficient conditions","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Delay effects","Signal processing algorithms","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","delay systems","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov matrix equations","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","synchronisation","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic neural networks time-varying delay system","synchronization approach","linear matrix inequality","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaotic system","Delay","Synchronization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370165","abstract":"In this paper, global synchronization is discussed for chaotic neural networks time-varying delay.

This can cause image segmentation failure. This paper proposes a modified particle swarm optimization method (MPSO), which improves convergence speed and search capacity and avoid the premature phenomena when used in threshold extraction.

Based on the principle of sliding mode control , using the fuzzy systems with linear adjustable parameters which are used to approximate plant unknown functions, a novel design scheme of adaptive fuzzy controller is proposed. With the help of a supervisory controller, the resulting closed-loop system is globally stable in the sense that all signals involved are uniformly bounded. Furthermore, the adaptive compensation terms of the approximation errors are adopted to minimize the influence of modeling errors and parameter estimation errors. In addition, the approach does not require the dead-zone model parameters and parameters in the lumped uncertainty to be known constants. By theoretical analysis, the closed-loop control system is proved to be globally uniformly ultimately bounded with tracking errors converging to zero. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370214","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370104/04370214.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Control for a Class of Nonlinear MIMO Time-Delayed Systems with Unknown Dead-Zone Input","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370214/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Control for a Class of Nonlinear MIMO Time-Delayed Systems with Unknown Dead-Zone Input","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797344","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4370214/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fuzzy Control for a Class of Nonlinear MIMO Time-Delayed Systems with Unknown Dead-Zone Input","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-1-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053829S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4370104","articleId":"4370214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4370230,"authors":[{"name":"Xing-Yu Lai","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronical Engineering, Guangdong Institute of Science and Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xing-Yu","lastName":"Lai","id":"37970060700"},{"name":"Chun-Yan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronical Engineering, Guangdong Institute of Science and Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chun-Yan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37957853600"},{"name":"Bang-Yan Ye","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bang-Yan","lastName":"Ye","id":"37669019500"},{"name":"Wei-Guang Li","affiliation":["College of Mechanical Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei-Guang","lastName":"Li","id":"38189495500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370230","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370230","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent control","Intelligent networks","Adaptive control","Machining","Recurrent neural networks","Entropy","Machine learning","Mathematics","Mathematical model","Machine tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","machining","neurocontrollers","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent adaptive control","machining process","hybrid recurrent neural network","generalized entropy square error criterion","learning algorithm","machine tool","constant force control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intelligent","Adaptive control","Machining process","Hybrid recurrent neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370230","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370218/04370230.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","startPage":"676","endPage":"681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Adaptive Control of Machining Process Based on Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network","abstract":"Aiming at the feasibility of intelligent adaptive control for a machining process, a new network architecture, called a hybrid recurrent neural network (HRNN) is first presented based on the diagonal recurrent neural network (DRNN).

Three important matters are involved. 1) A new acceleration-level bi-criteria scheme is proposed for preventing the INAM solution discontinuities and joint torques instability problem. It combines the minimum infinity-norm and minimum two-norm solutions by using a new problem formulation. 2) Such a bi-criteria scheme is then reformulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem with its coefficient matrix being positive semi-definite. 3) The LVI-based primal-dual neural network is finally chosen to solve online such a QP problem as well as the bi-criteria weighting scheme. This is in view of the fact that the LVI-based primal-dual neural network has a simple piecewise-linear dynamics and higher computational efficiency. Simulation results based on PMUA560 robot manipulator also illustrate the advantages of using such a neural weighting scheme proposed in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370237/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9805443","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4370237/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bi-Criteria Acceleration Minimization of Redundant Robot Manipulators using New Problem Formulation and LVI-Based Primal-Dual Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-Criteria Acceleration Minimization of Redundant Robot Manipulators using New Problem Formulation and LVI-Based Primal-Dual Neural Network","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-2-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054902S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4370218","articleId":"4370237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4370265,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-Fang Nan","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Guo-Fang","lastName":"Nan","id":"37541954300"},{"name":"Min-Qiang Li","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Min-Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37557961100"},{"name":"Jie Li","affiliation":["China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, Langfang, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Li","id":"37964109500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370265","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":454},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor systems","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Global Positioning System","Application software","Intelligent networks","Genetic engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","genetic algorithms","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["node localization estimation","real-coded genetic algorithm","location knowledge","cooperative sensing","combinatorial optimization problems","wireless sensor networks","fitness function","genetic operators","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Node localization","Genetic algorithm","Wireless sensor network","Positioning systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370265","abstract":"Location knowledge of sensor nodes in a network is essential for many tasks such as routing, cooperative sensing, or service delivery in ad hoc, mobile, or sensor networks, and it is hard to get the precision solution by traditional node localization algorithm, while genetic algorithm is an effective methodology for solving combinatorial optimization problems, so, in this paper, a real-coded version of the commonly used genetic algorithm is described in order to evaluate the precision of node localization problem in wireless sensor networks, meanwhile, the corresponding fitness function and genetic operators are designed.

Traditional heuristic methods and exact algorithms based upon enumeration, branch-and-bound, integer programming or dynamic programmings usually face great difficulties for large and complex projects. In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is presented to solve this problem. Firstly, a mapping is created between the feasible schedule and the position of the particle, then the IPSO begin to search the global best and the local best until the stop criteria is satisfied. A case study is presented and a comparison is made between IPSO and some traditional heuristic methods.

It mainly utilizes the differential information to guide its further search. But the differential information also results in instability of performance. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been developing rapidly and has been applied widely since it is introduced, as it can converge quickly. But PSO easily got stuck in local optima because it easily loses the diversity of swarm. This paper proposes a combination of DE and PSO (termed DEPSO) that makes up their disadvantages. DEPSO combines the differential information obtained by DE with the memory information extracted by PSO to create the promising solutions. Finally, DEPSO is tested to solve several benchmark optimization problems. The experimental results show the effectiveness of DEPSO algorithm for the multimodal function, and also verify that DEPSO can perform better than other algorithms (DE, CPSO) in solving the benchmark problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797545","htmlLink":"/document/4370294/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Differential Evolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Differential Evolution","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-2-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110823S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4370218","articleId":"4370294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4370295,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Feng Hao","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, CN"],"firstName":"Zhi-Feng","lastName":"Hao","id":"37288317800"},{"name":"Zhi-Gang Wang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37963162200"},{"name":"Han Huang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Huang","id":"37401099200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370295","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370295","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Educational institutions","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Machine learning algorithms","Computer science","Optimization methods","Genetic algorithms","Benchmark testing","Animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","crossover operator","search optimization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Swarm intelligence","Crossover"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370295","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370218/04370295.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","startPage":"1036","endPage":"1040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Crossover Operator","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a method for tackling optimization functions. However, it is easily trapped into the local optimization when solving high-dimension functions. To overcome this shortcoming, a modified particle swarm optimization is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, a crossover step is added to the standard PSO. The crossover is taken between each particle's individual best position. After the crossover, the fitness of the individual best position is compared with that of the two offspring, and the best one is taken as the new individual best position. The crossover can help the particles jump out of the local optimization by sharing the others' information. The experiment on five benchmark functions shows that the modified PSO is more effective to find the global optimal solution than other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370295/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797550","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4370295/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Crossover Operator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm with Crossover Operator","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-2-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040483S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4370218","articleId":"4370295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4370306,"authors":[{"name":"Qing He","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Condition Monitoring and Control for Power Plant Equipment, Ministry of Education, College of Energy and Power Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"He","id":"37089099865"},{"name":"Dong-Mei Du","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Condition Monitoring and Control for Power Plant Equipment, Ministry of Education, College of Energy and Power Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dong-Mei","lastName":"Du","id":"37398974600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370306","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Induction motors","Neural networks","Frequency","Electric motors","Circuit faults","Stator windings","Rotors","Magnetic flux","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","induction motors","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","induction motor","neural networks","current spectrum","broken bar number"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Induction motor","Broken bar","Neural networks","Fault diagnosis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370306","abstract":"The fault diagnosis theory and its methods for inductor motor are summarized.

In this paper fault detection of reduced order model of nonlinear systems based on long-term prediction is proposed by using self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN). The main advantages of SOFNN are that, firstly, it is very user friendly as it can automatically determine the model structure and identify the model parameters without requiring the in-depth knowledge about fuzzy systems and neural networks; secondly, it provides the excellent modeling accuracy. Data gathered at an aero engine test-bed serve as the test vehicle to demonstrate the long-term prediction. A fault detection system is designed by using SOFNN. SOFNN is trained and used to simulate system dynamic characteristic. The simulation result is compared with actual output, and then fault error is drawn. The simulation result shows that, SOFNN can simulate the system more accurately, thus the change of residual error is easy to be detected. This assures the validity of this fault detection system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370312/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797193","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4370312/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection for Gas Turbines Based on Long-Term Prediction using Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection for Gas Turbines Based on Long-Term Prediction using Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-2-94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079679S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370218","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4370218","articleId":"4370312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4370346,"authors":[{"name":"Su-Fang An","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shijiazhuang University of Economics, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Su-Fang","lastName":"An","id":"37654456200"},{"name":"Kun-Qi Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shijiazhuang University of Economics, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Kun-Qi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37597273000"},{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Agricultural University of Hebei, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089077715"},{"name":"Xiu-Feng Cai","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shijiazhuang University of Economics, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Xiu-Feng","lastName":"Cai","id":"37960770800"},{"name":"Shuang Zhao","affiliation":["College of Economics and management, Hebei Polytechnic University, Tangshan, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37407586600"},{"name":"Jing-Fang Wu","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shijiazhuang University of Economics, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Jing-Fang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37963015200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370346","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370346","abstract":"This paper proposes an improved weighted fuzzy reasoning algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for handling classification problems.

with Facial Model using Genetic Algorithms","abstract":"In this paper, the Genetic Algorithms (GA) is used to learn the facial model consisting of eyes, nose and mouth for face validation. This facial model improves the detection rate for the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) head detector [9], which produces ellipse-like objects as face candidates, by applying a second validation stage to verify these candidates. In formulating the genetic algorithm, a two-dimensional binary genome mapped from the facial images is used to encode the chromosomes. We also propose to employ properties, such as the eye position and the eye-point preservation, to evaluate the fitness in the genetic algorithm. We demonstrate the experimental results of using two initialization models, namely the blank model and the average edge model, to learn the facial model for face validation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370438/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797649","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4370438/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Face Validation with Facial Model using Genetic Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Validation with Facial Model using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-3-109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065712S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","xplore-issue":"4370329","articleId":"4370438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4370439,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Hao Li","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Automation and Control, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Hao","lastName":"Li","id":"37557442400"},{"name":"Ming-Jong Tsai","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Automation and Control, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Jong","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37555534600"},{"name":"Cheng-Che Chen","affiliation":["Gallant Precision Machining Company Limited, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Che","lastName":"Chen","id":"37835943700"},{"name":"Chun-Hao Li","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Automation and Control, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Hao","lastName":"Li","id":"37087312301"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370439","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370439","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser beam cutting","Strips","Artificial neural networks","Laser modes","Copper","Predictive models","Electronics packaging","Optical materials","Testing","Laser applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","ball grid arrays","copper","laser beam cutting","neural nets","production engineering computing","strips","substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser cutting","artificial neural network","ball grid array strip","epoxy","substrate","backpropagation","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","heat affected zone","Cu"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ball Grid Array (BGA) strip","Heat Affected Zone(HAZ)","Artificial Neural network (ANN)","back-propagation (BP)","Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370439","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370329/04370439.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","startPage":"1796","endPage":"1801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Laser Cutting Qualities for BGA Strip by Artificial Neural Networks","abstract":"This paper reports a new laser cutting technology for cut ting a BGA (ball grid array) strip. Due to the cutting path including two different materials, i.e. epoxy and copper substrate, so we adopt two cutting processes for epoxy and copper substrate, respectively. Then we utilize artificial neural networks (ANN) to build two predictive models including epoxy and substrate for laser cutting qualities of a strip BGA. Two ANN models use the back-propagation (BP) with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. From the experimental results, the average predicted errors of epoxy for training and testing processes are 0.496% and 1.786%, respectively, and the errors for substrate are 0.797% and 1.532%, respectively. The results show that two ANN models have the predictive ability to estimate three laser cutting qualities for BGA strip accurately. The ANN applied to this paper is very successfully and may give guides in the predictions of cutting BGA strip and is expected to be useful for laser applications in other industry fields.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370439/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797641","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4370439/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Laser Cutting Qualities for BGA Strip by Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Laser Cutting Qualities for BGA Strip by Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-3-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063385S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","xplore-issue":"4370329","articleId":"4370439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4370459,"authors":[{"name":"Wan-De Weng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wan-De","lastName":"Weng","id":"37265956300"},{"name":"Rui-Chang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nankai Institute of Technology, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Rui-Chang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37553450300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370459","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Equalizers","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Equations","Costs","Nonlinear distortion","Finite impulse response filter","Bit error rate","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","multiplexing equipment","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based neural network","digital channel equalizer","SCFNN equalizer","Verilog hardware description language","de-multiplexers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCFNN","Fuzzy logic","Nural network","Channel equalizer"]}],"abstract":"The hardware design of an SCFNN equalizer is presented in this paper.

Up to now, most production engineers have either used trial-and-error or Taguchi's parameter design method to determine initial settings for a number of parameters, including melt temperature, injection pressure, injection velocity, injection time, packing pressure, packing time, cooling temperature, and cooling time. But due to the increasing complexity of product design and multi-response quality characteristics, these multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) methods have some definite shortcomings. This research integrates Taguchi's parameter design methods with back-propagation neural networks, genetic algorithms, and engineering optimization concepts, to optimize the initial process settings of plastic injection molding equipment. The research results indicate that the proposed approach can effectively help engineers determine optimal initial process settings, reduce set-test iterations, and achieve competitive advantages on product quality and costs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370443","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1917","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370443/04370460.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ANN and GA-Based Process Parameter Optimization for MIMO Plastic Injection Molding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4370460/","displayDocTitle":"ANN and GA-Based Process Parameter Optimization for MIMO Plastic Injection Molding","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797640","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANN and GA-Based Process Parameter Optimization for MIMO Plastic Injection Molding","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-4-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114426S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4370443","articleId":"4370460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4370463,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Ling Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Ling","lastName":"Lu","id":"37935012200"},{"name":"Chin-Shyurng Fahn","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Shyurng","lastName":"Fahn","id":"37267118100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370463","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Computer networks","Inspection","Nearest neighbor searches","Tree data structures","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Computer science","Data engineering","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","self-organising feature maps","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical artificial neural networks","high similar large data sets","visual inspection","automatic monitoring equipments","self-organizing feature map","learning vector quantization","LVQ"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Similarity search","SOM","LVQ","Recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370463","abstract":"This paper proposes a hierarchical artificial neural network for recognizing high similar large data sets. It is usually required to classify large data sets with high similar characteristics in many applications. Analyzing and identifying those data is a laborious task when the methods adopted are primarily based on visual inspection. In many field applications, data sets are measured and recorded continuously using automatic monitoring equipments. Therefore, a large amount of data can be collected, and manual inspection has become an unsuitable approach to recognizing those data. This proposed hierarchical neural network integrates self-organizing feature map (SOM) networks and learning vector quantization (LVQ) networks. The SOM networks provide an approximate method for computing the input vectors in an unsupervised manner. Then the computation of the SOM may be viewed as the first stage of the proposed hierarchical network. The second stage is provided by the LVQ networks based on a supervised learning technique that uses class information to improve the quality of the classifier from the first stage. The multistage hierarchical network attempts to factorize the overall input vector into a number of small groups, each of which requires very little computation. Consequently, by use of the proposed network, the loss in accuracy can be small.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370463","startPage":"1930","endPage":"1935","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370443","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370443/04370463.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Artificial Neural Networks for Recognizing High Similar Large Data Sets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370463/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Artificial Neural Networks for Recognizing High Similar Large Data Sets","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4370463/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797637","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Artificial Neural Networks for Recognizing High Similar Large Data Sets","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-4-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066606S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4370443","articleId":"4370463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4370475,"authors":[{"name":"Bing-Fei Wu","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bing-Fei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37275267600"},{"name":"Li-Shan Ma","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Chienkuo Technology University, Changhua, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Shan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37291473400"},{"name":"Jau-Woei Perng","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jau-Woei","lastName":"Perng","id":"37282877200"},{"name":"Tsu-Tian Lee","affiliation":["National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsu-Tian","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277271100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370475","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-term control","Fuzzy logic","Optimal control","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Automatic control","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Error correction","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","optimal control","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control design","PID control","single-input fuzzy logic controller","optimal control","membership function","gain parameter","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy logic controller","Optimal control","PID type controller","Single input fuzzy logic Controller (SFLC)","Genetic algorithm (GA)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370475","abstract":"In this paper, the PID type single-input fuzzy logic controller (SFLC) is proposed by modified from PD type SFLC.

Sequence alignment is the essential task for similar sequence search in bioinformatics. The biological sequence databases have getting larger in past decade, finding sequences similar to the query sequence is a time consuming task. By transforming sequences into numeric feature vectors, we can quickly filter out sequences whose feature vectors are distant to the feature vector of the query sequence. We proposed an adaptive weighting distance which is based on feature vector that contains three groups of features: count, extended relative position dispersion (XRPD), and extended absolute position dispersion (XAPD) of a DNA sequence. Each group has four dimensions for A, C, T, and G. When computing distance between two feature vectors, Euclidean distance and L1 distance are commonly used. In this paper, we use weighted L1 distance for computing the distance between two feature vectors. We derive weights for the four nucleotides from the count group, and apply the weights to both XRPD and XAPD. In other words, if a certain kind of nucleotide appears much frequent than the other kinds of nucleotides, the weight for the kind of nucleotide should also be large in XRPD and XAPD groups. Experiments show that such distance of feature vectors helps reflect the distance between sequences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Weighting Distance for Feature Vectors of Biological Sequences","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370523","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370443/04370523.pdf","startPage":"2269","endPage":"2273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370443","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Weighting Distance for Feature Vectors of Biological Sequences","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4370523/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797690","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Weighting Distance for Feature Vectors of Biological Sequences","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-4-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047003S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","xplore-issue":"4370443","articleId":"4370523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4370551,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406766200"},{"name":"Lei Li","affiliation":["College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Li","id":"37539247000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370551","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Multiuser detection","Computational complexity","SGML","Iterative algorithms","Multiple access interference","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","communication complexity","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["step-down grouping maximization-likelihood algorithms","DS-CDMA system","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximization likelihood","Iterative detection","Direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems","Multi-user detection","Step-down grouping maximization likelihood (SGML)"]}],"abstract":"We focus on the maximization-likelihood algorithms and its application aimed at achieving satisfactory performance at the price of a moderate computational complexity.

According to the idea of credit in commercial filed, a dual-credits model is established to evaluate the behaviors both of the resource and the resource provider. Response time and cost also be considered to select resource. They are calculated by a time-cost synthetic measurement function. Based on above factors, a resource selection algorithm that takes dual-credits, response time, cost as rules, and chooses best resource as target is proposed.

In addition, a brief survey on current MLPNN architecture selection methods is given. The average weighted F-score is widely used in information extraction field and we will adopt it as the criterion of MLPNN performance evaluation. In this paper, we first use an exhaustive MLPNN architecture selection method to investigate different MLPNN architecture selection criteria when the performance of the MLPNN is evaluated by the average weighted F-Score on testing data. Then we adopt a genetic algorithm (GA) based MLPNN architecture selection method to reduce the running time of MLPNN architecture selection. Experimental results show that the MLPNN architectures selected by the GA with \"Train MSE\" yield the best testing average weighted F-score with acceptable number of hidden neurons and running time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370611/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9805464","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4370611/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Experimental Study on Error Functions for Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Architecture Selection with Average Weighted F-Score Evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Study on Error Functions for Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Architecture Selection with Average Weighted F-Score Evaluation","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-5-59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06236S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","xplore-issue":"4370552","articleId":"4370611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4370616,"authors":[{"name":"Jeng-Tze Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Department of Electronic Engineering, Vanung University of Technology, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jeng-Tze","lastName":"Huang","id":"38026476500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370616","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370616","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backstepping","Neural networks","Control nonlinearities","Adaptive control","Programmable control","Control design","Adaptive systems","Damping","Degradation","Approximation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","compensation","control nonlinearities","control system synthesis","feedback","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["singularity-free adaptive backstepping control design","strict-feedback system","switching-type neural network","virtual control design","certainty equivalence","compensation","resembled nonlinearities","high-gain controller","nonlinear damping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network","Adaptive backstepping control design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370616","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370552/04370616.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","startPage":"2755","endPage":"2760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Singularity-Free Adaptive Backstepping Design for Strict-Feedback Systems using Neural Networks","abstract":"A switching-type neural network (NN) based adaptive backstepping control design is presented for the tracking tasks of strict-feedback systems.

This paper proposes a hybrid image classification method, which integrates wavelet transform, rough set approach, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Wavelet transform is employed to decompose the original images into different frequency sub-bands, then a set of statistical features are extracted from the wavelet coefficients, the feature set can be viewed as an information system. Although wavelet transform well decorrelates images, there still exist dependencies between coefficients. Hence the features extracted from the coefficients may be correlated. If the features from one sub-band are dependent on the features from another sub-band, the later one can be removed. Rough set approach is utilized to remove the correlated or redundant features. The reduced information system finally fed into neural network for classification. The performance of the method is evaluated in terms of training accuracy and testing accuracy, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370670/04370671.pdf","startPage":"3045","endPage":"3050","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rough-Neural Image Classification using Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image classification","Wavelet transforms","Feature extraction","Data mining","Information systems","Artificial neural networks","Frequency","Wavelet coefficients","Decorrelation","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","image classification","image representation","neural nets","rough set theory","statistical analysis","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rough-neural image classification","discrete wavelet transform","rough set approach","artificial neural networks","image decomposition","statistical feature extraction","image decorrelation","reduced information system","image tree representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image classification","Wavelet transform","Rough sets","Neural networks","Statistical features"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Rough-Neural Image Classification using Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4370671/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797743","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rough-Neural Image Classification using Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-6-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082887S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4370670","articleId":"4370671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4370684,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Wu Xiong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Sheng-Wu","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37335047400"},{"name":"Yong-Xiang Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Xiang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37596269600"},{"name":"Ning Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Xu","id":"37291069500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370684","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370684","abstract":"Security requirements of security-critical real-time applications must be met in addition to satisfying timing constraints. However, conventional real-time scheduling algorithms ignore the applications' security requirements. Tao Xie, Xiao Qin et al. have proposed a security-aware scheduling strategy, or SAREC, and scheduling algorithm SAREC-EDF, which integrates security requirements into scheduling for real-time applications. However, there are some disadvantages in his algorithms. The scheduling problem is a maximization optimization problem with constraints, but SAREC-EDF does not compare its solutions in global scope, just like greedy algorithm, as a result, its last result maybe not the best one. In this paper, on the one hand, we originally construct two mathematic models for the real-time scheduling problems considering security requirements. On the other hand, we propose a new security-aware real-time scheduling algorithm based on genetic algorithm (SAREC-GA), which can improve overall security level of the system by up to approximately 25% on the base of SAREC-EDF when real-time requirement is guaranteed. Experiment data and simulated results show the feasibility and availability of the proposed models and method.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370684","startPage":"3122","endPage":"3127","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370670/04370684.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAREC-GA: A Security-Aware Real-Time Scheduling Algorithm with Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Genetic algorithms","Mathematics","Data security","Real time systems","Mathematical model","Application software","Cryptography","Machine learning","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint theory","cryptography","genetic algorithms","real-time systems","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security-aware real-time scheduling algorithm","genetic algorithm","timing constraints","maximization optimization problem","mathematic models","encryption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-Time scheduling","Real-Time systems","Security awareness","Genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"SAREC-GA: A Security-Aware Real-Time Scheduling Algorithm with Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4370684/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797124","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAREC-GA: A Security-Aware Real-Time Scheduling Algorithm with Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-6-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071752S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4370670","articleId":"4370684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4370710,"authors":[{"name":"Xue-Qin Zhang","affiliation":["East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xue-Qin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405025700"},{"name":"Chun-Hua Gu","affiliation":["East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Chun-Hua","lastName":"Gu","id":"37409689200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370710","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Intrusion detection","Large-scale systems","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Telecommunication traffic","Statistical learning","Quadratic programming","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","computational geometry","statistical analysis","support vector machines","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex-hull SVM","network anomaly detection","network security","statistical learning algorithm","support vector machine","computational geometry theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Support vector machine","Convex hull"]}],"abstract":"Network anomaly detection is a critical task to ensure network security. With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370670/04370710.pdf","startPage":"3261","endPage":"3266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CH-SVM Based Network Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370710/","displayDocTitle":"CH-SVM Based Network Anomaly Detection","volume":"6","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797135","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4370710/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CH-SVM Based Network Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-6-40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051101S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4370670","articleId":"4370710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4370720,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Xia Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Xia","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37934134500"},{"name":"Hong Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Yan","id":"37275205400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370720","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Sequences","Humans","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Diseases","Testing","Pattern analysis","Frequency","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","DNA","genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["repeat pattern size determination","DNA sequences","tandem repeat detection","human genome","human disease","regulatory functions","genomic sequence data","autoregressive model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autoregressive model","Tandem repeat","Pattern size","Residual error"]}],"abstract":"Tandem repeats occur frequently in the human genome. The functions of them are still largely unclear, but some of them have been shown to cause human disease, and have relationship with regulatory functions. Thus, detecting tandem repeats has considerable significance. Because of the undetermined length of repeat pattern and indels and substitutions existing in a tandem repeat, identifying a tandem repeat in genomic sequence data is a difficult task. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed, which is based on the autoregressive (AR) model. We analyze residual errors of the AR model with different orders for a DNA sequence. According to changes of residual errors, we can determine whether a sequence contains a tandem repeat and what pattern size is.

The system consisted of two main parts, namely, recognition training and recognition testing. The printed character images fed to the first part were derived from standard character patterns widely used in a computer currently totalling 72, 864 characters. As for the images used for recognition testing, they were captured from a computer screen and stored in BMP pattern, amounting to 1,015 characters. The findings in this research revealed that the database used was of large size and data was transformed from a table frame of 64 x 64 pixels to be stored in the form of bit strings. A table size of 64 x 64 pixels was used to enable a wide variety of distribution patterns of the stable state of each character, making its identity more obvious. This, of course, caused a modification process in each generation till the final generation which took a long time while the database was used to represent the population of the final generation of each character must be large enough for the bit string used to represent these characters. This would enable the system to recognize a character based on its frequency with the largest number of those bit string patterns. Out of 1,015 printed Thai characters tested, it was found that the system could recognize (accept) 986 characters or 97.14 %, while rejecting 6 characters or 0.59 % and misrecognizing 23 characters or 2.27 %. The recognition speed is 85 seconds per character on the average.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370727","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370670/04370727.pdf","startPage":"3354","endPage":"3359","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Printed Thai Character Recognition by Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Printed Thai Character Recognition by Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9797302","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4370727/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Printed Thai Character Recognition by Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-6-57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057821S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4370670","articleId":"4370727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4370739,"authors":[{"name":"Waqas Anwar","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Waqas","lastName":"Anwar","id":"37832700500"},{"name":"Xuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37560326300"},{"name":"Lu Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Lu Li","id":"37935149200"},{"name":"Xiao-Long Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Long","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407494600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370739","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Natural languages","Tagging","Speech processing","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Error analysis","Data mining","Speech analysis","Computer science","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational linguistics","Markov processes","natural language processing","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical based part of speech tagger","Urdu language","speech tagging","disambiguation problem","n-gram Markov model","error analysis","confusion matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Urdu language","Language model","Part-of-speech tagging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370739","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370670/04370739.pdf","startPage":"3418","endPage":"3424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370739","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Based Part of Speech Tagger for Urdu Language","abstract":"In this paper we present a pioneering step in designing n-gram based part of speech tagger for the Urdu language.

To improve the performance of ACE, we have improved the weighting method, which combines the outputs of classifiers, and have added a new classifier pruning method. Experimental results showed that the enhanced ACE performed well for a synthetic dataset that contained both sudden and gradual changes and recurring concepts.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370670","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370670/04370772.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370772","startPage":"3607","endPage":"3612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Classifiers-Ensemble System for Tracking Concept Drift","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370772/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Classifiers-Ensemble System for Tracking Concept Drift","htmlLink":"/document/4370772/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"6","accessionNumber":"9797268","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Classifiers-Ensemble System for Tracking Concept Drift","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-6-102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065794S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4370670","articleId":"4370772","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4370831,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37557517200"},{"name":"Jie Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279940400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0973-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"}],"articleNumber":"4370831","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"abstract":"Conditional random fields (CRFs) are employed in this paper for resolving Chinese overlapping ambiguity in Chinese word segmentation. Instead of the traditional methods which treated the Chinese overlapping ambiguity as classification problem, the proposed approach regards this task as a sequence labeling problem. The best benefit of this method is that it can deal with overlapping ambiguous strings with any lengths no matter the ambiguous strings are pseudo ambiguity or true ambiguity. Several methods are tested on the same training and test corpora. The experimental results show that the CRF models achieve state-of-the-art performance. In comparison with the maximum entropy classifier and the traditional word bigram model, the accuracy has increased 3.98 % and 9.27 % respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370103/4370780/04370831.pdf","startPage":"3922","endPage":"3926","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Machine Learning Method for Chinese Overlapping Disambiguity--Conditional Random Fields","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Hidden Markov models","Entropy","Testing","Machine learning","Cybernetics","Labeling","Educational institutions","Humans","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","pattern classification","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning method","Chinese overlapping disambiguity","conditional random fields","Chinese word segmentation","Chinese overlapping ambiguity","classification problem","sequence labeling problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chinese word segmentation","Overlapping ambiguity","Conditional random fields","Word bigram model","Maximum Entropy classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A New Machine Learning Method for Chinese Overlapping Disambiguity--Conditional Random Fields","isConference":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4370831/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797487","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Machine Learning Method for Chinese Overlapping Disambiguity--Conditional Random Fields","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"ICMLC-7-51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087144S","chronDate":"19-22 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370103","isNumber":"4370780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370103","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4370780","articleId":"4370831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4370922,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A new approach is proposed to generating a family of neural networks for performing a set of related functions. Within a family, only one network needs to be trained to perform an input-output function mapping task and other networks can be derived from this trained base network without training. The base net thus acts as a generator of the derived nets. The proposed approach builds on three mathematical foundations: (1) symmetry for defining the relationship between functions; (2) weight transformations for generating a family of networks; (3) Euclidian distance function for measuring the symmetric relationships between the related functions. The proposed approach provides a formal foundation for systemic information reuse in ANNs.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370922","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04370922.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building a Family of Neural Networks using Symmetry as a Foundation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Feedforward neural networks","Computer science","USA Councils","Discrete transforms","Data mining","Equations","Probability distribution","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","training vector","training regime","input-output function mapping task","weight transformations","Euclidian distance function","ANN systemic information reuse","matrix equation","graph theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Building a Family of Neural Networks using Symmetry as a Foundation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4370922/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797777","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building a Family of Neural Networks using Symmetry as a Foundation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071697S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4370922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4370927,"authors":[{"name":"Shenshen Gu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shenshen","lastName":"Gu","id":"38182572200"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280531600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4370927","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"abstract":"In this paper, the K-Winners-Take-All (KWTA) problem is formulated equivalently to a linear program.

Most popular local training algorithms tend to be greedy and hence get stuck at the nearest local minimum of the error surface and this corresponds to suboptimal network model. Stochastic approaches in combination with local methods are used to obtain an effective set of training parameters. Due to the lack of effective fine-tuning capability, these algorithms often fail to obtain such an optimal set of parameters and are computationally expensive. As a trade-off between computational expense and accuracy required, a novel method to improve the local search capability of training algorithms is proposed in this paper. This approach takes advantage of TRUST-TECH (TRansformation Under STability-reTaining Equilibrium CHaracterization) to compute neighborhood local minima on the error surface surrounding the current solution in a systematic manner. Empirical results on different real world datasets indicate that the proposed algorithm is computationally effective in obtaining promising solutions.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370936","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04370936.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"95","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TRUST-TECH Based Neural Network Training","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"TRUST-TECH Based Neural Network Training","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9797788","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4370936/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TRUST-TECH Based Neural Network Training","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047485S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4370936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4370944,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Sampling is a key step for particle filters and has vital effects on simulation results. Since degeneracy of particles in samples sometimes is very severe, there exist only a few particles with significant weights. Thus the sample diversity is reduced significantly so that only a few particles are used to represent the corresponding probability distribution. Therefore, resampling has to be used very often during the whole procedure. This paper addresses a new method which can avoid the phenomenon of particle degeneracy. A backpropagation neural network is used to adjust low weight particles in order to increase their weights and particles with high weights may be split into two small ones if needed. Our simulation results on a typical tracking problem show that not only the phenomenon of particle degeneracy is effectively avoided but also tracking results are much better than those of the traditional particle filter.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370964","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04370964.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Strategy for Sampling of Particle Filters on the Tracking Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370964/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Strategy for Sampling of Particle Filters on the Tracking Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4370964/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797810","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Strategy for Sampling of Particle Filters on the Tracking Problem","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060542S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4370964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4370969,"authors":[{"name":"Derrick Mirikitani","affiliation":["Goldsmiths College, Department of Computing, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Derrick","lastName":"Mirikitani","id":"37297407600"},{"name":"Nikolay Nikolaev","affiliation":["Goldsmiths College, Department of Computing, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Nikolay","lastName":"Nikolaev","id":"37330251200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4370969","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Recurrent neural networks","Kalman filters","Finite impulse response filter","Training data","Filtering algorithms","Neural networks","Equations","Standards development","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","Kalman filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","recursive estimation","sequential estimation","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive Bayesian Levenberg-Marquardt training","recurrent neural networks","local regularization hyperparameter","weight posterior distribution","stable sequential Hessian estimation","RTRL algorithm","real time recurrent learning","extended Kalman training algorithm","finite impulse response neural filter","time series modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370969","abstract":"This paper develops a Bayesian approach to recursive second order training of recurrent neural networks.

Gene expression profiles naturally conform to assumptions about data formats raised by NMF. However, it is known not to lead to unique results concerning the component signals extracted. In this paper we consider an extension of the NMF algorithm which provides unique solutions whenever the underlying component signals are sufficiently sparse. A new sparseness measure is proposed most appropriate to suitably transformed gene expression profiles. The resulting fitness function is discontinuous and exhibits many local minima, hence we use a genetic algorithm for its optimization. The algorithm is applied to toy data to investigate its properties as well as to a microarray data set related to Pseudo-Xanthoma Elasticum (PXE).","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370971","startPage":"294","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04370971.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Genetic Algorithms for Microarray Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370971/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Genetic Algorithms for Microarray Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4370971/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797815","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Genetic Algorithms for Microarray Analysis","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066491S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4370971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4370974,"authors":[{"name":"Jerica Urias","affiliation":["Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Jerica","lastName":"Urias","id":"37844451700"},{"name":"Denisse Hidalgo","affiliation":["Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Denisse","lastName":"Hidalgo","id":"37694744300"},{"name":"Patricia Melin","affiliation":["The Division of Graduate Studies and Research of Tijuana, Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Melin","id":"37271192400"},{"name":"Oscar Castillo","affiliation":["The Division of Graduate Studies and Research of Tijuana, Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Castillo","id":"37271198900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4370974","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4370974","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Biometrics","Fingerprint recognition","Face recognition","Speech recognition","Authentication","Humans","Iris recognition","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","face recognition","fingerprint identification","fuzzy logic","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["response integration","modular neural networks","type-2 fuzzy logic","biometric systems","human person recognition","biometric authentication","face recognition","fingerprint recognition","voice recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370974","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04370974.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"311","endPage":"315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method for Response Integration in Modular Neural Networks using Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for Biometric Systems","abstract":"We describe in this paper a new method for response integration in modular neural networks using type-2 fuzzy logic.

The sensor is developed by means of a lightweight plunger probe and an optical mouse. An experimental prototype was developed which involves bouncing or hopping of the plunger based impact probe freely on the plain surface of an object under test. The time and features of bouncing signal are related to the material type and its surface properties, and each material has a unique set of such properties. During the bouncing of the probe, a time varying signal is generated from optical mouse that is recorded in a data file on PC. Some dominant unique features are then extracted using digital signal processing tools to optimize neural network based classifier used with the sensor. The classifier is developed on the basis of application of supervised structures of neural networks. For this, an optimum multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP NN) model is designed to maximize accuracy under the constraints of minimum network dimension. The optimal parameters of MLP NN model based on various performance measures and classification accuracy on the testing datasets even after attempting different data partitions are determined. The classification accuracy of MLP NN is found reasonable consistently in respect of rigorous testing using different data partitions. The performance of the proposed MLP NN based classifier has also been compared with the statistical classification trees approach. It is seen that the former one clearly outperforms the statistical approach.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370994","startPage":"424","endPage":"429","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4370994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04370994.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network based Sensor for Classification of Material Type and its Surface Properties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4370994/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network based Sensor for Classification of Material Type and its Surface Properties","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4370994/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797829","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network based Sensor for Classification of Material Type and its Surface Properties","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074755S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4370994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4371005,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The function exhibits learning and generalization abilities perfectly comparable with those achieved by the typical activation functions but, what is more, can be easily implemented in hardware through only binary shift operations. The first derivative, contrary to the classical solutions, requires a simple constant coefficient multiplier resulting in a great advantage in terms of area occupancy and performance. The accuracy analysis carried out by the average and maximum error, the high computational speed and the small amount of hardware resources point out that the proposed approach is fully competitive with the most recent implementations of activation functions capable of learning.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371008","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371008.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"511","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Speed, Programmable Implementation of a Tanh-like Activation Function and Its Derivative for Digital Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"High Speed, Programmable Implementation of a Tanh-like Activation Function and Its Derivative for Digital Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9797837","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4371008/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Speed, Programmable Implementation of a Tanh-like Activation Function and Its Derivative for Digital Neural Networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084782S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4371017,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Unfortunately, there is no clear definition of the key term diversity, leading to several diversity measures and many, more or less ad hoc, methods for diversity creation in ensembles. In addition, no specific diversity measure has shown to have a high correlation with test set accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to empirically evaluate ten different diversity measures, using neural network ensembles and 11 publicly available data sets. The main result is that all diversity measures evaluated, in this study too, show low or very low correlation with test set accuracy. Having said that, two measures; double fault and difficulty show slightly higher correlations compared to the other measures. The study furthermore shows that the correlation between accuracy measured on training or validation data and test set accuracy also is rather low. These results challenge ensemble design techniques where diversity is explicitly maximized or where ensemble accuracy on a hold-out set is used for optimization.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371035","startPage":"661","endPage":"666","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371035.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Importance of Diversity in Neural Network Ensembles - An Empirical Investigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371035/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Importance of Diversity in Neural Network Ensembles - An Empirical Investigation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371035/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797858","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Importance of Diversity in Neural Network Ensembles - An Empirical Investigation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065448S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-29"},{"_id":4371041,"authors":[{"name":"Yuehui Chen","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Lab, University of Ji''nan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Yuehui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281033700"},{"name":"Feng Chen","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Lab, University of Ji''nan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37962604000"},{"name":"Qiang Wu","affiliation":["Computational Intelligence Lab, University of Ji''nan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37877095200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371041","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371041","abstract":"The forecasting models for time series forecasting using computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) , genetic programming (GP) and gene expression programming (GEP), especially hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have achieved favorable results.

We investigate the effect of variable thresholds in the C-CNN. We show that this threshold cannot be too large if one wishes to produce chaotic dynamics in the C-CNN, which is important to studies of chaotic communication and combinatorial optimization problem. We are particularly interested in variable thresholds because Shi and Wang (2005) showed that the objectives of the frequency assignment problem (FAP) can be mapped into thresholds of the neural network, which resulted in superior performance compared to traditional penalty approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371044","startPage":"711","endPage":"714","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371044.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable Thresholds in the Chaotic Cellular Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Cellular neural networks","Chaotic communication","Biological system modeling","Neurons","Neural networks","Frequency","Concurrent computing","Power engineering and energy","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","chaotic communication","combinatorial mathematics","frequency allocation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable threshold","chaotic cellular neural network","chaotic dynamics","chaotic communication","combinatorial optimization problem","frequency assignment problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Variable Thresholds in the Chaotic Cellular Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371044/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9811749","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable Thresholds in the Chaotic Cellular Neural Network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053476S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4371051,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Li","affiliation":["Learning Systems Group, Computer Science Option, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Li","id":"37965427400"},{"name":"Hsuan-Tien Lin","affiliation":["Learning Systems Group, Computer Science Option, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hsuan-Tien","lastName":"Lin","id":"37963333900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371051","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"abstract":"The 0/1 loss is an important cost function for perceptrons.

Our algorithms are computationally efficient, and usually achieve the lowest 0/1 loss compared with other algorithms. Such advantages make them favorable for nonseparable real-world problems.

Although as argued in the papers by Amaral et al. (2000) and Koch and Laurent (1999), some biological neural networks do not reveal scale-free nature on the level of single neurons, we believe, based on previous research (Piekniewski and Schreiber, 2007) and numerical simulations presented in this article, that such structures should emerge on the level of neuronal groups as a consequence of their rich dynamics and memory properties. The network we analyze is built upon the spiking model introduced by Eugene Izhikevich (2003; 2006). It is formed as a set of randomly constructed neuronal groups (each group to some extent resembles the original model), connected with Gaussian weights. Such a system exhibits rich dynamics, with chattering, bursting and other forms of neuronal activity, as well as global synchronization episodes. We analyze similarities of spike trains of neurons coming from different groups, and build a weighted graph which approximates the similarity of activities (synchronization) of pairs of units. The output graph reveals a scale-free structure giving support to our claim.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emergence of Scale-free Graphs in Dynamical Spiking Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371052","endPage":"759","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371052.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371052","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Biological system modeling","Biological neural networks","Graph theory","Numerical simulation","Computational modeling","Web sites","Collaboration","Cellular networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","graph theory","neural nets","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scale-free graphs","dynamical spiking neural networks","biological neural networks","neuronal groups","Gaussian weights","neuronal activity","weighted graph"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Emergence of Scale-free Graphs in Dynamical Spiking Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371052/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9797870","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emergence of Scale-free Graphs in Dynamical Spiking Neural Networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048982S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4371055,"authors":[{"name":"Iris Fabiana de Barcelos Tronto","affiliation":["Brazilian National Institute for Space Research, Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil"],"firstName":"Iris Fabiana","lastName":"de Barcelos Tronto","id":"38547366800"},{"name":"Jose Demisio Simoes da Silva","affiliation":["Brazilian National Institute for Space Research, Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jose Demisio Simoes","lastName":"da Silva","id":"38559675400"},{"name":"Nilson Sant'Anna","affiliation":["Brazilian National Institute for Space Research, Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil"],"firstName":"Nilson","lastName":"Sant'Anna","id":"38255693500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371055","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371055","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Software quality","Project management","Costs","Programming","Mathematical model","Iris","Accuracy","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","project management","regression analysis","software management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","regression models","software effort estimation","software project management","product quality","cost reduction","software development process","regression based models"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371055","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371055.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"771","endPage":"776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Artificial Neural Network and Regression Models in Software Effort Estimation","abstract":"Good practices in software project management are basic requirements for companies to stay in the market, because the effective project management leads to improvements in product quality and cost reduction.

Satellite-based observations of the atmosphere are related to atmospheric and surface variables by the radiative transfer equation. Direct inversion of the radiative transfer equation is often intractable as the underlying atmospheric phenomenology is usually neither linearly related to the observations nor Gaussian. Neural networks provide a computationally efficient alternative with their relatively simple structure. However, effective use of neural network techniques in problems of this nature requires careful preprocessing of the input data, and this preprocessing is often highly dependent on the remote sensing scenario under consideration. In this paper, we present techniques for preprocessing neural network input data in the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The utility of these techniques is demonstrated with several applications, including the estimation of the atmospheric temperature profile, water vapor profile, and precipitation rate using satellite-based passive microwave and infrared measurements.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371061","startPage":"807","endPage":"812","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371061.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Atmospheric Thermodynamic Profiling with Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermodynamics","Neural networks","Data preprocessing","Equations","Atmosphere","Computer networks","Passive microwave remote sensing","Temperature sensors","Microwave theory and techniques","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric temperature","atmospheric thermodynamics","geophysics computing","neural nets","radiative transfer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric thermodynamic profiling","neural network","atmospheric parameter retrieval algorithm","satellite-based observations","radiative transfer equation","atmospheric phenomenology","atmospheric temperature profile","water vapor profile","precipitation rate","satellite-based passive microwave","infrared measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Atmospheric Thermodynamic Profiling with Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371061/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797877","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Atmospheric Thermodynamic Profiling with Neural Networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046363S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4371068,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Intra methods interpolate missing lines by using surrounding pixels in the current field. Inter methods interpolate missing lines by using pixels and the motion information of multiple fields. Neural network deinterlacing that uses multiple fields has been proposed. It provides improved performance compared to existing neural network deinterlacing algorithms that use a single field. However, when adjacent fields are very different, neural network deinterlacing that uses multiple fields may not provide good performance. To address this problem, we propose using field-MSE values as additional inputs. These MSE values can provide helpful information so that the networks can consider field differences in using multiple fields. Experimental results show that the use of the proposed algorithm results in improved performance.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371072","startPage":"869","endPage":"872","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371072.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Deinterlacing Using Multiple Fields and Field-MSEs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Interpolation","Video sequences","Multi-layer neural network","Pixel","Degradation","Bandwidth","Motion compensation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","motion compensation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network deinterlacing","field-MSE","motion information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Deinterlacing Using Multiple Fields and Field-MSEs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371072/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9811754","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Deinterlacing Using Multiple Fields and Field-MSEs","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048168S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4371074,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Wakame","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Technology, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Wakame","id":"37945517100"},{"name":"Yuko Osana","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Technology, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuko","lastName":"Osana","id":"37340856700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371074","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Neural networks","Delay effects","Neurons","Biological neural networks","Biological system modeling","Associative memory","Chemicals","Damping","Spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","delays","neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic neural network","time delay","connection weight","heteroassociation","autoassociation","pattern dynamic association"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371074","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a chaotic neural network with time delay term (CNNTD).

The classifiers splits a fingerprint database into four different subclasses. A multi-layer perceptron network using a backpropagation algorithm has shown to suit this problem best, outperforming both BAM, Hopfleld, Kohonen and just barely SVM, with a correct classification rate of 88.8%.

This work presents an application driven digital hardware exploration where we implement realtime, isolated digit speech recognition using a Liquid State Machine (a recurrent neural network of spiking neurons where only the output layer is trained). First we test two existing hardware architectures, but they appear to be too fast and thus area consuming for this application. Then we present a scalable, serialised architecture that allows a very compact implementation of spiking neural networks that is still fast enough for real-time processing. This work shows that there is actually a large hardware design space of Spiking Neural Network hardware that can be explored. Existing architectures only spanned part of it.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371111","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371111.pdf","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact hardware for real-time speech recognition using a Liquid State Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371111/","displayDocTitle":"Compact hardware for real-time speech recognition using a Liquid State Machine","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797913","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371111/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact hardware for real-time speech recognition using a Liquid State Machine","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054177S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4371124,"authors":[{"name":"Lin-Yu Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lin-Yu","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37410521500"},{"name":"Wen-Ching Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Networking Technology, Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan","Department of Computer Science, National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Ching","lastName":"Chen","id":"37597890200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371124","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Space exploration","Particle swarm optimization","Medical diagnosis","Evolutionary computation","Genetic programming","Backpropagation algorithms","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory search algorithm","feedforward neural network training","connection weights","orthogonal array","n-bit parity problem","classification problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371124","abstract":"In this work, the systematic trajectory search algorithm (STSA) is proposed to train the connection weights of the feedforward neural networks.

For such data the predictive engine shifts from the historical auto-regression to modelling complex non-linear relationships between multidimensional features and the time series outputs. In order to exploit these time-disparate relationships for the improved time series forecasting, the system requires a flexible methodology of combining multiple prediction models applied to multiple versions of the temporal data under significant noise component and variable temporal depth of predictions. In reply to this challenge a composite time series prediction model is proposed which combines the strength of multiple neural network (NN) regressors applied to the temporally varied feature subsets and the postprocessing smoothing of outputs developed to further reduce noise. The key strength of the model is its excellent adaptability and generalisation ability achieved through a highly diversified set of complementary NN models. The model has been evaluated within NISIS Competition 2006 and NN3 Competition 2007 concerning prediction of univariate and multivariate time-series. It showed the best predictive performance among 12 competitive models in the NISIS 2006 and is under evaluation within NN3 2007 Competition.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371129","startPage":"1204","endPage":"1209","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371129.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Ensembles for Time Series Prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Predictive models","Autoregressive processes","Chemical processes","Computational intelligence","Machine learning","Input variables","Fluid flow measurement","Time series analysis","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","mathematics computing","neural nets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network ensemble","time series prediction","time-stamped data sequence","auto-regression analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Ensembles for Time Series Prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371129/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797927","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Ensembles for Time Series Prediction","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047077S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-29"},{"_id":4371132,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37423052900"},{"name":"Dong Nan","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Nan","id":"37870632500"},{"name":"Zhengxue Li","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhengxue","lastName":"Li","id":"37421723500"},{"name":"Jinling Long","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Jinling","lastName":"Long","id":"37958906300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371132","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371132","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Neurons","Extraterrestrial measurements","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","feedforward neural nets","functions","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural networks","functions compact set","linear functions metric space"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371132","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371132.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"1222","endPage":"1225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximation to a Compact Set of Functions by Feedforward Neural Networks","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the approximation capability of feedforward neural networks to a compact set of functions.

This paper proposes the use of a feature saliency algorithm and an artificial neural network to perform iris segmentation. Many current Iris segmentation approaches assume a circular shape for the iris boundary if the iris is directly facing the camera. Occlusion by the eyelid can cause the visible boundary to have an irregular shape. In our approach an artificial neural network is used to statistically classify each pixel of an iris image with no assumption of circularity. First, a feed-forward feature saliency technique is performed to determine which combination of features contains the greatest discriminatory information. Image brightness, local moments, local orientated energy measurements and relative pixel location are evaluated for saliency. Next, the set of salient features is used as the input to a multi-layer perceptron feed-forward artificial neural network trained for classification. Testing showed 96.46 percent accuracy in determining which pixels in an image of the eye were iris pixels. For occluded images, the iris masks created by the neural network were consistently more accurate than the truth mask created using the circular iris boundary assumption. Post-processing to retain the largest contiguous piece in the iris mask increased the accuracy to 98.2 percent.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371143","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371143.pdf","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1288","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Artificial Neural Networks and Feature Saliency Techniques for Improved Iris Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Using Artificial Neural Networks and Feature Saliency Techniques for Improved Iris Segmentation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9797936","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4371143/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Artificial Neural Networks and Feature Saliency Techniques for Improved Iris Segmentation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049842S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4371146,"authors":[{"name":"Eiji Mizutani","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Management, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Mizutani","id":"37324249500"},{"name":"Stuart Dreyfus","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Dreyfus","id":"37329891500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371146","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Backpropagation algorithms","Jacobian matrices","Gaussian processes","Appraisal","Symmetric matrices","Decision making","Optimal control","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stagewise second-order backpropagation","multistage neural-network learning","sum-squared-error measure","multilayer-perceptron learning","layered symmetry","rank-update methods","Hessian-vector multiply"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371146","abstract":"We analyze the Hessian matrix H of the sum-squared-error measure for multilayer-perceptron (MLP) learning, showing the following intriguing results: At an early stage of learning, H is indefinite.

As it turns out neural networks yielded the best forecasting performance.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371157","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1369","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371157.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network vs. Linear Models for Stock Market Sectors Forecasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Predictive models","Stock markets","Economic forecasting","Testing","Banking","Artificial neural networks","Investments","Pharmaceuticals","Data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forecasting theory","investment","neural nets","regression analysis","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","linear model","stock market sector forecasting","stock index","banking sector","retail sector","investment allocation","Box-Jenkins methodology","multiple regression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network vs. Linear Models for Stock Market Sectors Forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371157/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797945","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network vs. Linear Models for Stock Market Sectors Forecasting","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091311S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4371159,"authors":[{"name":"Dragan Djurdjanovic","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Djurdjanovic","id":"37369924000"},{"name":"Jianbo Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Jianbo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37963516800"},{"name":"Kenneth A.

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed. An approach inspired by the functionalities and characteristics of natural immune system is presented and discussed in the paper. The feasibility of the newly proposed paradigm is also partially demonstrated through application examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371159.pdf","startPage":"1375","endPage":"1382","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Immune Systems Inspired Approach to Anomaly Detection and Fault Diagnosis for Engines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Immune system","Fault detection","Fault diagnosis","Engines","Automotive engineering","System testing","Automobiles","Maintenance","Production","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive components","automotive electronics","fault diagnosis","internal combustion engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["immune systems inspired approach","anomaly detection","fault diagnosis","automotive diagnosis","diagnostic strategy","engines","automobiles"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Immune Systems Inspired Approach to Anomaly Detection and Fault Diagnosis for Engines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371159/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9797947","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Immune Systems Inspired Approach to Anomaly Detection and Fault Diagnosis for Engines","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076681S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4371168,"authors":[{"name":"Takase Haruhiko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Takase","lastName":"Haruhiko","id":"37330720900"},{"name":"Mayumi Masahiko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Mayumi","lastName":"Masahiko","id":"37945379000"},{"name":"Kita Hidehiko","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Kita","lastName":"Hidehiko","id":"37330718700"},{"name":"Hayashi Terumine","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Hayashi","lastName":"Terumine","id":"37330719200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371168","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-layer neural network","Fault tolerance","Neural networks","Interference","Large scale integration","Artificial neural networks","Neural network hardware","Backpropagation algorithms","Distributed computing","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","multilayer neural network generalization","generalization ability","local augmentation method","training algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371168","abstract":"In this paper, we propose the method to enhance both generalization ability and fault tolerance of multilayer neural networks.

Avoiding the interference, we propose local augmentation method (LAUG) to enhance fault tolerance. It duplicates hidden units according to the importance of each unit. Since it manipulates a trained network keeping the input-output relation of the network, LAUG does not interfere with any training algorithms to enhance generalization ability.

In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach to compute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processing model in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure. Specifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appear in a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acyclic labeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an inductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursive neural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and non-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic graphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well predefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to others is expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore, the combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalized model of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, a sophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first step for building future advanced intersection safety systems.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371169","startPage":"1434","endPage":"1440","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371169.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk Assessment Algorithms Based on Recursive Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371169/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Risk Assessment Algorithms Based on Recursive Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371169/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797956","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk Assessment Algorithms Based on Recursive Neural Networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053221S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4371170,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Oliveri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Oliveri","id":"37945902900"},{"name":"Riccardo Rizzo","affiliation":["Italian National Research Council-ICAR, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Rizzo","id":"37729399200"},{"name":"Antonio Chella","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Chella","id":"37274744700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371170","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":246},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Computational modeling","Biological system modeling","Timing","Neural networks","Circuit noise","Chaos","Signal processing","Noise robustness","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","readout electronics","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spike-timing-dependent plasticity","liquid state machine","neural system","spiking neurons","time function classification","memoryless readout circuit","linear perceptron","liquid state recognition","spike timing identification"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Application of Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity to Readout Circuit for Liquid State Machine","abstract":"Liquid state machine (LSM) is a neural system based on spiking neurons that implements a mapping between functions of time.

In this paper we show that using the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) a single neuron with short training session can be used to recognize the state of the liquid due to an input signal.

Feature sets based on signal periodicity, beat information, sub-band energy, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and wavelet transforms are proposed and each of the feature sets are individually analyzed for their pertinence in the proposed task. A parallel multi-layered perceptron network is proposed which offers a classification accuracy of 84.4% to distinguish between 6 different genres. The proposed architecture is compared with a support vector machine based classifier and is found to perform superiorly than the later.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371179","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371179.pdf","startPage":"1494","endPage":"1499","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network based Audio Content Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network based Audio Content Classification","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9797964","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4371179/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network based Audio Content Classification","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064889S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4371191,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos Quiles","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (SCC), University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Quiles","id":"37829960400"},{"name":"Liang Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (SCC), University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279831000"},{"name":"Roseli Romero","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (SCC), University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Roseli","lastName":"Romero","id":"37327807800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371191","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Biological system modeling","Focusing","Layout","Biological systems","Signal generators","Feature extraction","Data mining","Computer science","Biology computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","neural nets","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual selection mechanism","pulse-coupled neural network","visual scene","salient object","visual attention system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371191","abstract":"In this paper a visual selection mechanism based on the pulse-coupled neural network is proposed for discriminating one object among others in a given visual scene by delivering the focus of attention to the salient object.

Since a larger sample is more representative of the population, it is advantageous to design the classifier with all the available cases, and to use a resampling technique for performance prediction. We conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation study to compare the ability of different resampling techniques in predicting the performance of a neural network classifier designed with the available sample. We investigated a technique based on the cross-validation, the leave-one-out method, and three different types of bootstrapping, namely, the ordinary, .632, and .632+ bootstrap techniques. Our results indicated that, under the study conditions, there can be a large difference in the accuracy of the prediction obtained from different resampling methods, especially when the feature space dimensionality is relatively large and the sample size is small. Under this type of conditions, the .632 and .632+ bootstrap methods were superior to the other techniques studied. Although this investigation is performed under some specific conditions, it reveals important trends for the problem of classifier performance prediction under the constraint of a limited data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371224/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797991","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371224/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classifier Performance Estimation Under the Constraint of a Finite Sample Size: Resampling Schemes Applied to Neural Network Classifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classifier Performance Estimation Under the Constraint of a Finite Sample Size: Resampling Schemes Applied to Neural Network Classifiers","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107212S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4371226,"authors":[{"name":"Liwen You","affiliation":["School of Information Science, Computer and Electrical Engineering, Halmstad University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Liwen","lastName":"You","id":"37970686700"},{"name":"Thorsteinn Rognvaldsson","affiliation":["School of Information Science, Computer and Electrical Engineering, Halmstad University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Thorsteinn","lastName":"Rognvaldsson","id":"37569999700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371226","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Genetic mutations","Support vector machines","Performance analysis","Biological system modeling","Sparse matrices","Extraterrestrial measurements","Linearity","Proteins","Radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","data analysis","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biobasis function neural networks","similarity metric","linear function","distance measure linearity","distance measure normalization","biological data set","linear classifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371226","abstract":"An analysis of biobasis function neural networks is presented, which shows that the similarity metric used is a linear function and that bio-basis function neural networks therefore often end up being just linear classifiers in high dimensional spaces.

In this paper we propose a method to segment mammogram image using a self-organizing neural network based on spatial isomorphism. The method used is a modified version of the algorithm proposed by Venkatesh and Rishikesh [1] to extract object boundaries in an image. This model explores the principle of spatial isomorphism and self-organization in order to create flexible contours that characterize shapes in images. We modified the original algorithm to overcame problems of local minimum, poor performance for image object with large concavity and imprecise results when simple or far from object border contour are chosen. A comparison of both algorithm and original segmentation used by the MIAS database [9] is presented.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371230","startPage":"1796","endPage":"1801","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371230.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of mammogram using self-organizing neural networks based on spatial isomorphism","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371230/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of mammogram using self-organizing neural networks based on spatial isomorphism","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371230/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9797996","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of mammogram using self-organizing neural networks based on spatial isomorphism","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074867S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4371231,"authors":[{"name":"Karl P.

More specifically, the purpose is to protect a fence line from approaching human being and vehicles. We have used geophones to detect seismic signals generated by footsteps and vehicles. While acoustic sensors can be fooled by artificial sounds, fooling geophones by artificial seismic waves is a complicated task. Moreover detecting human footsteps -weak signal to noise ratio -by acoustic waveform is subject to the distance between the sensor and human. Therefore detecting a human's footsteps by employing acoustic information will not be possible unless he/she walks close to the acoustic sensors. Geophones are resonant devices; therefore any vibration in the substrate can generate seismic waveforms which could be very similar to the signature generated by footstep or vehicle. In addition, geophone response is completely substrate dependent, rendering recognition of footsteps or vehicle vs. other vibrations to be a very difficult task. Therefore, in order to have robust and high-confidence classification/detection of a human/ vehicle threats, we have employed the DSNN. The network is trained to extract intrinsic characteristics of the waveform, frame by frame. Then parameters of the network are analyzed by Gaussian mixture models. The results of our study show 88.8% and 86% correct classification rate for the detection of human footsteps and vehicle respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371238/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9798000","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371238/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Application of Dynamic Synapse Neural Networks on Footstep and Vehicle Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of Dynamic Synapse Neural Networks on Footstep and Vehicle Recognition","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054247S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4371240,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Miradi","affiliation":["Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Miradi","id":"37419011500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371240","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Asphalt","Concrete","Data mining","Neural networks","Function approximation","Computer networks","Noise reduction","Roads","Multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge acquisition","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rule extraction","function approximator","artificial neural network training","REFANN","multilayer perceptron","MLP","feedforward architecture","knowledge extraction","Dutch porous asphalt concrete pavement","PAC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371240","abstract":"Among a large number of existing ANN, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) with feedforward (FF) architecture is one of the most widely used structures.

This fact justifies the application of predictive techniques of diagnosis, with the objective to minimize possible failures and to increase the trustworthiness of the system. Amongst these techniques, one of the most distinguished are the analysis of gases dissolved in the oil (gaseous chromatography) and the physical-chemical analysis of the isolating oil. Although their generalized use, the diagnosis made by these techniques presents deficiencies, demanding the presence of specialists to complete the diagnosis. A great contribution for the electric sector would be a decision support tool capable of providing a correct and automatic diagnosis, to improve the monitoring process of power transformers. This article presents a diagnosis system, based on two artificial neural networks, each dedicated to the analysis of gaseous chromatography and physical-chemical of the isolating oil, respectively. The idea to enclose these two techniques is to accomplish a more complete diagnosis of the equipment, as well as a reduction of specialists' participation, creating a more automatic diagnosis system. The obtained results with the proposed system are compared with traditional methods. The resultant system represents a more complete decision support tool in the determination of the diagnosis of power transformers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transformers","Neural networks","Petroleum","Dissolved gas analysis","Gases","Minerals","Power engineering and energy","Degradation","Power generation","Computational intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chromatography","computerised monitoring","decision support systems","fault diagnosis","neural nets","oils","power engineering computing","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transformers diagnosis","electric energy","predictive techniques","gases analysis","gaseous chromatography","physical-chemical analysis","isolating oil","decision support tool","power transformer monitoring","artificial neural networks","fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Transformers","Fault Diagnosis","Gaseous Chromatography","Neural Nets","Physical-Chemical Analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371253","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371253.pdf","startPage":"1929","endPage":"1934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Transformers Diagnosis Using Neural Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Transformers Diagnosis Using Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371253/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371253/","accessionNumber":"9798011","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Transformers Diagnosis Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049403S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4371254,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Nevertheless, two main problems are still present for using neural networks in this domain: first, poor load forecasting in holidays because complex load behavior, and second, the lack of a global model for both holidays and non-holidays. To solve these two problems, we propose a new special holiday encoding that considers holidays and its preceding and following days which are also affected by the holiday. This proposed encoding is used in conjunction with quick propagation neural network. In the experiments the proposed holiday encoding is compared with other encoding based on the forecasting error of quick propagation. To evaluate their performances, we used a Peruvian load data set. The results show that the proposed holiday encoding produce better forecasting results than the results produced by other holiday encoding. Finally, these same results are also better than those results obtained by using ARIMA model which is a statistical technique also used in practice.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371254","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371254.pdf","startPage":"1935","endPage":"1940","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Daily Load Forecasting Using Quick Propagation Neural Network with a Special Holiday Encoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Daily Load Forecasting Using Quick Propagation Neural Network with a Special Holiday Encoding","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9966814","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4371254/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Daily Load Forecasting Using Quick Propagation Neural Network with a Special Holiday Encoding","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091739S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4371259,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Pedro Timoszczuk","affiliation":["DEE/EPUSP/PSI-Laboratory of Integrated Systems-LSI-ICONE Group, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Antonio Pedro","lastName":"Timoszczuk","id":"37374847300"},{"name":"Euvaldo F.

The first layer of PCNN performs a pulse coding task and its outputs are used as inputs to a second self-organizing layer that learns the pulse's statistics. Initially, the well known Mel-cepstral frequency coefficients were used as a benchmark to verify the new architecture's capability of learning the speaker information. After these preliminary tests, the Mel scaled filter bank energy coefficients were used, resulting in a biologically plausible architecture. The first results demonstrated the PCNN's ability to deal with temporal information contained in speech signals. The proposed architecture is promising, presenting 82% recognition when compared with 96% of the classical MLP classifier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371259/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9805500","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371259/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speaker Recognition Using Pulse Coupled Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker Recognition Using Pulse Coupled Neural Networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039601S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4371266,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej A.

Islanding of large-scale power systems is a combinatorial explosion problem. Thus, it is very difficult to find an optimal solution within reasonable time using analytical methods. This paper presents a new method to solve this problem. In the proposed method, angle modulated particle swarm optimization (AMPSO) is utilized to find a number of efficient islanding solutions for large-scale power systems due to its computational efficiency. First, desired generators groups is obtained using slow coherency algorithm. AMPSO is then used to optimize a fitness function defined according to both generation/load balance and similarity to the desired generator grouping. In doing so, the resulted islanding solutions provide good static and dynamic stability. Simulations for power systems of different scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371280","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371280.pdf","startPage":"2087","endPage":"2092","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow Coherency and Angle Modulated Particle Swarm Optimization Based Islanding of Large Scale Power Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Slow Coherency and Angle Modulated Particle Swarm Optimization Based Islanding of Large Scale Power Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9798025","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4371280/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow Coherency and Angle Modulated Particle Swarm Optimization Based Islanding of Large Scale Power Systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054921S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4371284,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Song Pei","affiliation":["School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science, University of Oklahama, Norman, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Jin-Song","lastName":"Pei","id":"37555843000"},{"name":"Eric C.

A set of spaces is constructed from selected solutions along the Pareto front which enables the understanding of the internal properties of the data based on visual inspection of non-dominating spaces with different properties.

A neuron is essentially a nonlinear dynamical system. Its state depends on the interactions among its previous states, its intrinsic properties, and the synaptic input it receives. These factors are included in Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, which describes the ionic mechanisms involved in the generation of an action potential. This paper proposes training of an artificial neural network to identify and model the physiological properties of a biological neuron, and mimic its input-output mapping. An HH simulator was implemented to generate the training data. The proposed model was able to mimic and predict the dynamic behavior of the HH simulator under novel stimulation conditions; hence, it can be used to extract the dynamics (in vivo or in vitro) of a neuron without any prior knowledge of its physiology. Such a model can in turn be used as a tool for controlling a neuron in order to study its dynamics for further analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System Identification for the Hodgkin-Huxley Model using Artificial Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371306","endPage":"2244","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371306.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"2239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371306","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Artificial neural networks","Biological system modeling","Neurons","Predictive models","Biology computing","High performance computing","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Training data","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system identification","Hodgkin-Huxley model","artificial neural networks","biological neuron","perceptron model","nonlinear dynamical system","Hodgkin-Huxley model","input-output mapping","information extraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"System Identification for the Hodgkin-Huxley Model using Artificial Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371306/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9798039","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System Identification for the Hodgkin-Huxley Model using Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056129S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4371309,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The spatio-temporal information contained in successive video frames allows to effectively accumulate a classifier's predictions for each person being tracked in an environment. In a particular realization of this network, a fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to classify faces detected in each frame, while a bank of Kalman filters is used to track blobs that contain the extracted faces moving in the environment. Performance of the what-and-where fusion neural network is compared to that of the fuzzy ARTMAP and k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) classifiers in terms of classification rate, convergence time and compression. In this paper, the impact on performance of setting different region of interest (ROI), of optimizing fuzzy ARTMAP parameters, and of selecting different training subset sizes, is assessed. Simulation results on real-world video sequences indicate that this network can achieve a classification rate that is significantly higher (by approximately 50% in some cases) than that of fuzzy ARTMAP alone, and than that of the k-NN.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371309","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","startPage":"2256","endPage":"2261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371309.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Neural networks","Face detection","Video sequences","Fuzzy neural networks","Biometrics","Law enforcement","Fingerprint recognition","Lighting","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","fuzzy neural nets","image sequences","Kalman filters","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human face recognition","what-and-where fusion neural network","video sequences","spatio-temporal information","fuzzy ARTMAP neural network","Kalman filters","k-nearest-neighbor classifiers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition in Video Using a What-and-Where Fusion Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371309/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371309/","accessionNumber":"9798042","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition in Video Using a What-and-Where Fusion Neural Network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.146663S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4371318,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Freeway incident detection can be seen as a two class pattern classification problem where the rate of convergence is a major concern besides accurate classification. The reduced multivariate polynomial based model is particularly suitable for simple classification problems with small number of features and with large number of patterns available. Freeway incident detection is one such class of problem. Smaller number of terms in the reduced model compared to original full multivariate polynomial model results in small network size and increased speed of convergence, thus making it useful for freeway incident detection. SVD based and gradient descent based least square estimators were used separately and encouraging results were obtained compared to other classification strategies used for freeway incident detection allowing for further work on the use of this model with improvement in the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371328","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371328.pdf","startPage":"2366","endPage":"2372","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reduced Multivariate Polynomial Based Neural Network Model Pattern Classifier for Freeway Incident Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Reduced Multivariate Polynomial Based Neural Network Model Pattern Classifier for Freeway Incident Detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9798054","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4371328/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reduced Multivariate Polynomial Based Neural Network Model Pattern Classifier for Freeway Incident Detection","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084295S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4371334,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Sacchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Engineering School of S\u00e4o Carlos, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Sacchi","id":"37936285100"},{"name":"Mustafa C.

Jaeger. This model, called Echo State Network (ESN), possesses a highly interconnected and recurrent topology of nonlinear processing elements, which constitutes a \"reservoir of rich dynamics\" and contains information about the history of input or/and output patterns. The interesting property of ESN is that only the memoryless readout is trained, whereas the recurrent topology has fixed connection weights. This reduces the complexity of recurrent neural network training to simple linear regression while preserving a recurrent topology. In this paper, the ESN is used to forecast hydropower plant reservoir water inflow, which is a fundamental information to the hydrothermal power system operation planning. A database of average monthly water inflows of Furnas plant, one of the Brazilian hydropower plants, was used as source of training and test data. The performance of the ESN is compared with SONARX network, RBF network and ANFIS model. The results show that the Echo State Network provides pretty good results for one-step ahead water inflow forecasting, providing a valuable information for the system operator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371334/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371334/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9798059","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Water Inflow Forecasting using the Echo State Network: a Brazilian Case Study","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Water Inflow Forecasting using the Echo State Network: a Brazilian Case Study","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055206S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4371338,"authors":[{"name":"Yaw-Jen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yaw-Jen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292170000"},{"name":"Chi-Tim Chang","affiliation":["Chung Yuan Christian University, Chung Li, TW"],"firstName":"Chi-Tim","lastName":"Chang","id":"37960408900"},{"name":"Jui-Ju Tsai","affiliation":["Chung Yuan Christian Univ., Chung Li"],"firstName":"Jui-Ju","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37960330500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371338","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Signal processing","Neural networks","Neurons","Calculus","Robustness","Transient response","Signal analysis","Preventive maintenance","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","feature extraction","neural nets","preventive maintenance","transient response","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","waveform signals","uncertain dynamic process","neural networks","Kohonen network","feature neuron","ellipsoidal calculus","oscillatory transient response","preventive maintenance","fault detection","semiconductor manufacturing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371338","abstract":"This paper presents a novel and simple feature extraction approach for drawing out the signal characteristics of uncertain dynamic processes by the feature neurons.

Incorporating with the ellipsoidal calculus, this approach can extract the process drifts and abnormal deviations in the process characteristics by limit checking. Moreover, it is robust even for the process with different process time durations. For the system with oscillatory transient response, this approach can be iteratively used to augment the amount of feature neurons to analyze the characteristics of any portion of the signal of interest in detail.

The proposed solution is capable of providing a signal-to-noise ratio gain in excess of 8 dB against the powerfull linear minimum bit error rate benchmarker, when supporting five users with the aid of three receive antennas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371349/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9798068","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371349/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric Kernel Detector for Multiple-Antenna Aided Beamforming Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric Kernel Detector for Multiple-Antenna Aided Beamforming Systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087335S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4371351,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochen Hu","affiliation":["Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaochen","lastName":"Hu","id":"37965448300"},{"name":"Gary G.

To verify the performance of the modified network, two pattern recognition simulations are completed. One is a two-class pattern recognition problem, and the other is a real-world problem, internal component recognition in the field of architecture engineering. Simulation results including final hidden neurons, error, and accuracy using the method proposed in this paper are compared with performance of radial basis functional link network, resource allocating network and RBF neural network with generalized competitive learning algorithm.

However, it is still very challenging to obtain good motion performance in humanoid motion planning, because of its high DOFs (degree of freedoms), variable mechanical structure and nonlinearity. In humanoid motion planning, the motion performance can be given only after one whole cycle motion is completed. This is a demanding condition for motion planning on either real robots or simulation platform. In this paper, a DFNN (dynamic neural fuzzy network) is adopted to model humanoid robots for motion planning. The inputs of DFNN are parameters which determine motion of humanoid robots. The output is evaluation of humanoid motion performance. The DFNN after training can give evaluation of motion performance immediately once the parameters are determined. The DFNN models not only the dynamics of robots, also the motion planning method. Therefore, the DFNN stores two kind of knowledge: the mapping between parameters and humanoid motion, the mapping between humanoid motion and motion performance.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371377","startPage":"2653","endPage":"2657","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371377.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Humanoid Robotics Modeling by Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371377/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Humanoid Robotics Modeling by Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371377/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9798082","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Humanoid Robotics Modeling by Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-486.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048265S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4371378,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Also existing intrusion detection approaches have some limitations, namely impossibility to process a large number of audit data for realtime operation, low detection and recognition accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we apply modular neural network models to detect and recognize attacks in computer networks. They are based on the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) neural networks and multilayer perceptrons (MLP). PCA networks are employed for important data extraction and to reduce high dimensional data vectors. We present two PCA neural networks for feature extraction: linear PCA (LPCA) and nonlinear PCA (NPCA). MLP is employed to detect and recognize attacks using feature-extracted data instead of original data. The proposed approaches are tested with the help of KDD-99 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed models are promising in terms of accuracy and computational time for real world intrusion detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371391/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9798092","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371391/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dimensionality Reduction and Attack Recognition using Neural Network Approaches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimensionality Reduction and Attack Recognition using Neural Network Approaches","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088839S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4371396,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The architecture is based on the existing TOTEM VLSI chip and contains 32 neurons each having a 256 times 10-bit weight RAM.

Using these techniques, the effort to test the software is directed at modules that are labelled as fault-prone by the classifier. This paper introduces a novel algorithm based on constructive RBF neural networks aimed at predicting the probability of errors in fault-prone modules; it is called RBF-DDA with Probabilistic Outputs and is an extension of RBF-DDA neural networks. The advantage of our method is that we can inform the test team of the probability of defect in a module, instead of indicating only if the module is fault-prone or not. Experiments carried out with static code measures from well-known software defect datasets from NASA show the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also compared the performance of the proposed method in software defect prediction with kNN and two of its variants, the S-POC-NN and R-POC-NN. The experimental results showed that the proposed method outperforms both S-POC-NN and R-POC-NN and that it is equivalent to kNN in terms of performance with the advantage of producing less complex classifiers.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371415","startPage":"2869","endPage":"2874","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371415.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Constructive RBF Neural Network for Estimating the Probability of Defects in Software Modules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371415/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Constructive RBF Neural Network for Estimating the Probability of Defects in Software Modules","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371415/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9798108","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Constructive RBF Neural Network for Estimating the Probability of Defects in Software Modules","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067569S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":4371426,"authors":[{"name":"Olivia Mendoza","affiliation":["Department of Research and Graduate Studies, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Olivia","lastName":"Mendoza","id":"37688321700"},{"name":"Patricia Melin","affiliation":["Department of Research and Graduate Studies, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Melin","id":"37271192400"},{"name":"Guillermo Licea","affiliation":["Department of Research and Graduate Studies, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Licea","id":"37620714400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371426","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Training data","Decision making","Neural networks","Image recognition","Image edge detection","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Detectors","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","edge detection","fuzzy logic","fuzzy reasoning","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","type theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interval type-2 fuzzy inference system","decision making","modular neural network training","image recognition","edge detection","Sugeno integral","fuzzy logic","human perception representation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we consider a Modular Neural Network combined with two Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS 2) for image recognition.

Modular neural networks (MNN) have shown significant learning improvement over single neural networks (NN). For this reason, the use of MNN for pattern recognition is well justified. However, network topology design of MNN is at least an order of magnitude more difficult than for classical NNs. We describe in this paper the use of a hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) for optimizing the topology of each of the neural network modules of the MNN. The HGA is clearly needed due to the fact that topology optimization requires that we are able to manage both the layer and node information for each of the MNN modules. Simulation results prove the feasibility and advantages of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371434","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371434.pdf","startPage":"2977","endPage":"2981","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern Recognition for Industrial Monitoring and Security using the Fuzzy Sugeno Integral and Modular Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Pattern Recognition for Industrial Monitoring and Security using the Fuzzy Sugeno Integral and Modular Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9798121","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4371434/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern Recognition for Industrial Monitoring and Security using the Fuzzy Sugeno Integral and Modular Neural Networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053628S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4371435,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Derakhshani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas City, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Derakhshani","id":"37329920200"},{"name":"Arun Ross","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Ross","id":"37271231600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1379-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1380-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"4371435","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Biometrics","Surface texture","Iris","Humans","Retina","Feature extraction","Computer science","Cities and towns","Optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","image texture","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture-based neural network classifier","biometric identification","ocular surface vasculature","wavelet-derived feature"]}],"abstract":"In an earlier work we had explored the possibility of utilizing the vascular pattern of the sclera, episclera, and conjunctiva as a biometric indicator.

Here we suggest a simple model of how such replay can be used to select an action and provide a reinforcement signal in the temporal credit assignment problem. When reward is found, replay of recent states experienced prior to discovery of reward is generated as a type of working memory. This acts to reinforces the actions associated with the replayed states, which are necessarily the actions which led to the reward being found, while other competing actions are not reinforced by the replay. On the other hand, actions which are selected but are not reinforced are punished. Here we suggest a firing rate neural network model implementation of this system based on the Basal-Ganglia anatomy with input from a cortical association layer generating replay and auto-catalytic feedback from the dopamine system as a reward signal modulating three-way Hebbian long term potentiation and depression (LTP/LTD) at the cortical-striatal synapses. The model is illustrated by numerical simulations of a simple example -that of associating a cue signal to a correct action to obtain reward after a delay period, typical of primate cue reward tasks. Through the learning the model shows a transition from an exploratory phase where actions are generated randomly, to a goal directed phase where the animal always chooses the correct action for each experienced state.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371440/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9798126","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371440/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Replay, Working Memory and Action Selection in Temporal Credit Assignment - a Simple Neural Network Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Replay, Working Memory and Action Selection in Temporal Credit Assignment - a Simple Neural Network Model","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062654S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4371444,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Shahini","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Shahini","id":"37937064100"},{"name":"William W.

Experimental results are also presented for forecasting chaotic time series in which interval type-2 fuzzy logic outperforms some hybrid intelligent approaches. Neural networks provide a comparable result with type-2 fuzzy systems.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371453","startPage":"3086","endPage":"3091","publicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2007.4371453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4370891","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4370890/4370891/04371453.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Hybrid Intelligent Systems, Neural Networks and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for Time Series Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371453/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Hybrid Intelligent Systems, Neural Networks and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for Time Series Prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371453/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9798133","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Hybrid Intelligent Systems, Neural Networks and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for Time Series Prediction","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"IJCNN-00-562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048309S","chronDate":"12-17 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4370890","isNumber":"4370891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4370890","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4370891","articleId":"4371453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4371533,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongyuan Cheng","affiliation":["Rockwell Automation Canada, Inc., Cambridge, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4371526/4371533/4371533-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhongyuan Cheng (M'96) received the M.A.Sc degree in electrical and computer engineering from Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1995.","In 2006, he joined Rockwell Automation Canada, Cambridge, ON, Canada, as a Senior Design Engineer.

Special configurations and combinations of diode rectifiers and active front end rectifiers for one of the stages of the drive are used to eliminate input harmonics. The topology can also keep high power factor at the input terminals. Simulation results are shown and some experiments with small three-stage prototype are displayed.

Nowadays, the switching frequency of power converters has been increasing up to values that make worthy the application of such switching frequency modulation techniques to reduce EMI emissions in power converters. Although random modulations have been applied before to power converters, periodic patterns can provide some advantages. First, theoretical principles of frequency modulation using three periodic patterns for the modulating function are presented. The influence of some important modulation parameters on the EMI reduction is analyzed and some considerations about the EMI filters design are also presented. The effectiveness of such methods in terms of EMI reduction is demonstrated theoretically and confirmed with experimental results obtained from tests carried out on two converters.

In both cases, attenuations obtained in conducted EMI are evaluated.

This applies especially to hybrid electrical vehicles (HEV) where a malfunction of the power electronics may prevent the vehicle to operate. Of paramount importance for the reliability of power electronics is the component operating temperature and temperature cycling. This paper deals with the development of an advanced simulation tool which is capable of determining the component temperature of a three-phase converter over long mission profiles. In addition, the expected converter reliability is calculated. To accomplish this, losses in the semiconductors and dc-link capacitors are determined first. Next, this loss data is fed into a thermal model to compute the component temperatures, for the whole mission profile. As basis for the reliability computation, failure-rate catalogs, such as Military Handbook 217F or RDF 2000, are used. Also an approach using simple formulas for lifetime prediction is presented. According to failure-rate catalogs, temperature cycles are of particular importance for the reliability of power semiconductors. A novel algorithm, detecting all relevant temperature cycles within the computed temperature curve is developed. Finally, the applicability and significance of the presented reliability prediction methods is assessed.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.909236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4371526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.909236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4371526/04371543.pdf","startPage":"2511","endPage":"2517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Prediction for Inverters in Hybrid Electrical Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Prediction for Inverters in Hybrid Electrical Vehicles","volume":"22","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4371543/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9674082","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371543/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Prediction for Inverters in Hybrid Electrical Vehicles","sourcePdf":"22tpel06-hirschmann.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122635S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4371526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"4371526","articleId":"4371543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4371544,"authors":[{"name":"Haibing Hu","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4371526/4371544/4371544-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haibing Hu was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1973.

So it can complete the computation of the three-level SVPWM in one sector.

A control scheme for implementing both modes of operation is presented, which has simple structure with smaller number of sensors. The proposed control algorithm including the whole system control is implemented on a low cost, fixed-point DSP TMS320F2812. The experimental results from a 1 kW prototype show that the proposed inverter system exhibits not only low THD grid current during the grid-connected mode and well regulated inverter voltage during the stand-alone mode, but also smooth and automatic transfer between the two modes of operation.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.909191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4371526/04371547.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.909191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4371526","startPage":"2293","endPage":"2298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Cost Utility Interactive Inverter for Residential Fuel Cell Generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4371547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Low Cost Utility Interactive Inverter for Residential Fuel Cell Generation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371547/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9674083","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4371547/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Cost Utility Interactive Inverter for Residential Fuel Cell Generation","sourcePdf":"22tpel06-jung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06661S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4371526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4371526","articleId":"4371547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4371548,"authors":[{"name":"Samir Kouro","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4371526/4371548/4371548-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Samir Kouro (S'04) was born in Valdivia, Chile, in 1978.

Due to the high output quality of the inverter, the torque response presents nearly no ripple. In addition, switching losses are greatly reduced since 80% of the power is delivered by the high-power cell of the asymmetric inverter, which commutates at fundamental frequency.

The designed application IP is utilized to implement the current vector controller in hardware owing to the requirement for high sampling frequency control (current loop: 16 kHz, pulsewidth modulation circuit: 4-8 MHz) but simple computation.

The primary-parallel-secondary-series structure is employed in this paper to handle the large input current, sustain the high output voltage and extend the voltage gain. A novel active clamp boost converter with coupled-inductors is proposed for high step-up applications. The third windings of the coupled-inductors have the function of voltage gain extension and the switch voltage stress reduction. The active clamp circuit serves for the interleaved two phases, which reduces the circuit complexity. Both the main and the auxiliary switches of the proposed converter are zero voltage transition performances during the whole switching transition. Meanwhile, the leakage energy is recycled by the active clamp circuit. The rectifier voltage stress is reduced by the primary-parallel-secondary-series structure. The rectifier reverse-recovery problem is alleviated by the leakage inductance. Experimental results for a 40-V-to-760-V converter verify the significant improvements in efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9671678","htmlLink":"/document/4371550/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Isolated ZVT Boost Converters for High-Efficiency and High-Step-Up Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Isolated ZVT Boost Converters for High-Efficiency and High-Step-Up Applications","sourcePdf":"22tpel06-li2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150993S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4371526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4371526","articleId":"4371550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4371552,"authors":[{"name":"Xun Liu","affiliation":["Convenient Power HK Limited, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4371526/4371552/4371552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xun Liu (S'04) was born in China in 1978.

In this paper, these differences are addressed. Based on a recently developed HID lamp model frame, a semi-theoretical fluorescent lamp model that can be determined by genetic algorithms and simple electrical measurements is presented. This model does not require any lamp data from lamp manufacturers. Its parameters can be determined from electrical voltage and current measurements of the lamps under AC operation at mains frequency. With the same set of parameters, the model can predict the lamp terminal characteristics accurately under low, medium and high frequency operations. Good simulation results were achieved when the lamp power was reduced to 60% of rated power and when the lamp was operated under step-up and step-down transient processes. Simulation results for different sizes of tubular and compact fluorescent lamps agree well with their experimental results. Particularly, the differences between simulation results and experimental results under rated power are less than 10%. Hence, the proposed model shows a good degree of accuracy: 1) for different types of fluorescent lamps; 2) at different operating frequencies; 3) under different dimming levels; and 4) during step-up and step-down transient processes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4371526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.909313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4371526/04371568.pdf","startPage":"2106","endPage":"2115","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.909313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semi-Theoretical Fluorescent Lamp Model for Time-Domain Transient and Steady-State Simulations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Semi-Theoretical Fluorescent Lamp Model for Time-Domain Transient and Steady-State Simulations","volume":"22","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4371568/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9674093","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371568/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi-Theoretical Fluorescent Lamp Model for Time-Domain Transient and Steady-State Simulations","sourcePdf":"22tpel06-yan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063088S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4371526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4371526","articleId":"4371568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":4371569,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongming Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen''s University Belfast, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4371526/4371569/4371569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhongming Ye (M'01\u2013SM'07) was born in Jiangsu, China.

Such a power distribution system subjects to more perturbations and load uncertainties than inverters operating with single load. A novel voltage control method is proposed in this paper for a high-frequency full-bridge resonant inverter with series-parallel resonant tank. A modified one-cycle controlled phase-shift modulation is proposed to effectively compensate the input line variations. The uncertainty model of the high frequency resonant inverter is developed and analyzed with the resonant circuit component tolerance, input line and load variations taken into design considerations. The voltage feedback controller is designed based on the H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">infin</sub>\n robust control theory and is implemented with analog discrete devices. The proposed control scheme has the advantages of fast response for both input line and load perturbations. It also ensures a wide range of system stability and guarantees robustness of the power converter. Both simulations and experimental results are provided to verify with the theoretical analysis through an experimental prototype of a full-bridge resonant inverter with an output power of 150-W operating at 1 MHz and an output voltage of 28 V (rms).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.909190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4371526","startPage":"2331","endPage":"2343","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4371526/04371569.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust One-Cycle Controlled Full-Bridge Series-Parallel Resonant Inverter for a High-Frequency AC (HFAC) Distribution System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4371569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4371569/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Robust One-Cycle Controlled Full-Bridge Series-Parallel Resonant Inverter for a High-Frequency AC (HFAC) Distribution System","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9674094","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust One-Cycle Controlled Full-Bridge Series-Parallel Resonant Inverter for a High-Frequency AC (HFAC) Distribution System","sourcePdf":"22tpel06-ye.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077031S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4371526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4371526","articleId":"4371569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4371570,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Zhao","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4371526/4371570/4371570-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhenyu Zhao (S'02) was born in Tianjin, China, in 1978.

Accordingly, a digital compensator is automatically constructed to provide fast dynamic response and good output voltage regulation. In addition, the load estimation data are used for improving efficiency of a converter having segmented transistors.

Different 3DTV systems rely on different 3D scene representations that integrate various types of data. Efficient coding of these data is crucial for the success of 3DTV. Compression of pixel-type data including stereo video, multiview video, and associated depth or disparity maps extends available principles of classical video coding. Powerful algorithms and open international standards for multiview video coding and coding of video plus depth data are available and under development, which will provide the basis for introduction of various 3DTV systems and services in the near future. Compression of 3D mesh models has also reached a high level of maturity. For static geometry, a variety of powerful algorithms are available to efficiently compress vertices and connectivity. Compression of dynamic 3D geometry is currently a more active field of research. Temporal prediction is an important mechanism to remove redundancy from animated 3D mesh sequences. Error resilience is important for transmission of data over error prone channels, and multiple description coding (MDC) is a suitable way to protect data. MDC of still images and 2D video has already been widely studied, whereas multiview video and 3D meshes have been addressed only recently. Intellectual property protection of 3D data by watermarking is a pioneering research area as well. The 3D watermarking methods in the literature are classified into three groups, considering the dimensions of the main components of scene representations and the resulting components after applying the algorithm. In general, 3DTV coding technology is maturating. Systems and services may enter the market in the near future. However, the research area is relatively young compared to coding of other types of media. Therefore, there is still a lot of room for improvement and new development of algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9673972","htmlLink":"/document/4373329/","displayDocTitle":"Coding Algorithms for 3DTV\u2014A Survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding Algorithms for 3DTV\u2014A Survey","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt11-smolic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.267487S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4373313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"4373313","articleId":"4373329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4373356,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Cao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Microwave, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4373350/4373356/4373356-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fang Cao (S'06) received the B.S. degree from Xiang Tan University, Hunan, China, in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree from the Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, in 2007.

Membership functions of the fuzzy-logic algorithm are designed for best fitting simulated radar signatures at C-band. Such signatures are derived for ten supervised hydrometeor classes by means of a fully polarimetric radar scattering model. The Fuzzy-logic Radar Algorithm for Hydrometeor Classification at C-band (FRAHCC) is designed to use a relatively small set of polarimetric observables, i.e., copolar reflectivity and differential reflectivity, but a version of the algorithm based on the use of specific differential phase is also numerically tested and documented. The classification methodology is applied to volume data coming from a C-band two-radar network that is located in north Italy within the Po valley. Numerical and experimental results clearly show the improvements of hydrometeor classification, which were obtained by using FRAHCC with respect to the direct use of fuzzy-logic-based algorithms that are specifically tuned for S-band radar data. Moreover, the availability of two C-band rainfall observations of the same event allowed us to implement a path-integrated attenuation correction procedure, based on either a composite radar field approach or a network-constrained variational algorithm. The impact of these correction procedures on hydrometeor classification is qualitatively discussed within the considered case study.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.903399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4373352/04373376.pdf","startPage":"3784","endPage":"3799","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.903399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised Fuzzy-Logic Classification of Hydrometeors Using C-Band Weather Radars","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Fuzzy-Logic Classification of Hydrometeors Using C-Band Weather Radars","volume":"45","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4373376/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671350","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373376/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Fuzzy-Logic Classification of Hydrometeors Using C-Band Weather Radars","sourcePdf":"45tgrs11-marzano-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107175S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4373352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4373352","articleId":"4373376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4373377,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Silvio Marzano","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Rome, Rome, Italy","CETEMPS Center of Excellence, University of L'' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4373352/4373377/4373377-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frank Silvio Marzano (S'89\u2013M'99\u2013SM'03) received the Laurea degree (cum laude) in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in applied electromagnetics from the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 1988 and 1993, respectively.","In 1993, he collaborated with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, National Research Council (CNR), Rome.

The multisatellite space-time prediction procedure, which is named Neural Combined Algorithm for Storm Tracking (NeuCAST), consists of two consecutive steps. First, the IR radiance field measured from a geostationary satellite radiometer (e.g., Meteosat) is projected ahead in time (e.g., 30 min); second, the projected radiance field is used in estimating the rainfall field by means of an MW-IR combined rain retrieval algorithm exploiting GEO-LEO observations. The NeuCAST methodology is extensively illustrated and discussed in this paper. Its accuracy is quantified by means of quantitative error indexes, which are evaluated on selected case studies of rainfall events in Southern Europe in 2003 and 2005.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.903685","startPage":"3800","endPage":"3812","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4373352/04373377.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.903685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rainfall Nowcasting From Multisatellite Passive-Sensor Images Using a Recurrent Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Low earth orbit satellites","Meteorology","Satellite broadcasting","Casting","Infrared imaging","Storms","Extraterrestrial measurements","Time measurement","Microwave radiometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrological equipment","hydrological techniques","neural nets","rain","remote sensing","storms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AD 2005","AD 2003","Southern Europe","rain retrieval algorithm","NeuCAST","neural combined algorithm for storm tracking","low Earth orbit satellite","geostationary Earth orbit satellite","rainfall field now casting","risky environmental situation","recurrent neural network","multisatellite passive sensor image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural network (NN)","nowcasting methods","passive sensors","precipitation retrieval","satellite remote sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Rainfall Nowcasting From Multisatellite Passive-Sensor Images Using a Recurrent Neural Network","volume":"45","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4373377/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9671351","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rainfall Nowcasting From Multisatellite Passive-Sensor Images Using a Recurrent Neural Network","sourcePdf":"45tgrs11-marzano2-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088767S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4373352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4373352","articleId":"4373377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4373378,"authors":[{"name":"Adriano Meta","affiliation":["German AeroSpace Center, Microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany","International Centre for Telecommunication and Radar, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4373350/4373378/4373378-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adriano Meta (S'01\u2013M'05) was born in Pontecorvo, Italy, in 1978.

One limiting factor to the use of FMCW sensors is the well-known presence of nonlinearities in the transmitted signal. This results in contrast- and range-resolution degradation, particularly when the system is intended for high-resolution long-range applications, as it is the case for SAR. This paper presents a novel processing solution, which solves the nonlinearity problem for the whole range profile. Additionally, the conventional stop-and-go approximation used in pulse-radar algorithms is not valid in FMCW SAR applications under certain circumstances. Therefore, the motion within the sweep needs to be taken into account. Analytical development of the FMCW SAR signal model, starting from the deramped signal and without using the stop-and-go approximation, is presented in this paper. The model is then applied to stripmap, spotlight, and single-transmitter/multiple-receiver digital-beamforming SAR operational mode. The proposed algorithms are verified by processing real FMCW SAR data collected with the demonstrator system built at the Delft University of Technology.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.906140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4373350/04373378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.906140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373350","startPage":"3519","endPage":"3532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Processing for FMCW SAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Signal Processing for FMCW SAR","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671366","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4373378/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Processing for FMCW SAR","sourcePdf":"45tgrs11-meta-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108232S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4373350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"231","xplore-issue":"4373350","articleId":"4373378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4373388,"authors":[{"name":"Ohad Barak","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Ohad","lastName":"Barak","id":"37284130800"},{"name":"David Burshtein","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Burshtein","id":"37272732600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4373388","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Parity check codes","Upper bound","Maximum likelihood decoding","Error probability","Information theory","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Australia","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","parity check codes","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC code ensembles","lower bounds","error rate","low-definition parity-check codes","weight distribution","random code","error exponent","maximum-likelihood decoding","graph connectivity","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error exponents","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","saddle point","weight (distance) distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4373387/04373388.pdf","startPage":"4225","endPage":"4236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.907448","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.907448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lower Bounds on the Error Rate of LDPC Code Ensembles","abstract":"The ensemble of regular low-definition parity-check (LDPC) codes is considered.

Using a graph-based approach to model the problem, we show that the minimum expected distortion of the 2DSQ is a convex function of the number of codecells in the side quantizers. This property allows the problem to be solved by Lagrangian minimization for which the optimal Lagrangian multiplier exists. Given a trial multiplier, we exploit a monotonicity of the objective function, and develop a simple and fast dynamic programming technique to solve the parameterized problem. To further improve the algorithm efficiency, we propose an RD-guided search strategy to find the optimal Lagrangian multiplier.

It is assumed that each link can be active and transmit with a constant power P or remain silent. The objective is to maximize the throughput over the selection of active links. By deriving an upper bound and a lower bound, it is shown that in the case of Rayleigh fading: (i) the maximum throughput scales like log n; (ii) the maximum throughput is achievable in a distributed fashion. The upper bound is obtained using probabilistic methods, where the key point is to upper bound the throughput of any random set of active links by a chi-squared random variable.

Using this scheme, antennas of the distributive relays work as transmit antennas of the sender and generate a space\u2013time code at the receiver. It achieves the maximal diversity when the transmit power is infinitely large. This paper is on the design of practical distributed space\u2013time codes (DSTCs). We use orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal designs which are originally used in the design of space\u2013time codes for multiple-antenna systems. It is well known that orthogonal space\u2013time codes have full diversity and linear decoding complexity. They are particularly suitable for transmissions in the network setting using distributed space\u2013time coding since their \"scale-free\" property leads to good performance. Our simulations show that they achieve lower error rates than the random code. We also compare distributed space\u2013time coding to selection decode-and-forward using the same orthogonal designs. Simulations show that distributed space\u2013time coding achieves higher diversity than selection decode-and-forward (DF) when there is more than one relay. We also generalize the distributed space\u2013time coding scheme to wireless relay networks with channel information at the relays. Although our analysis and simulations show that there is no improvement in the diversity, in some networks, having channel information at the relays saves both the transmission power and the transmission time.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.907516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4373387/04373409.pdf","startPage":"4106","endPage":"4118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.907516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Orthogonal and Quasi-Orthogonal Designs in Wireless Relay Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Using Orthogonal and Quasi-Orthogonal Designs in Wireless Relay Networks","volume":"53","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9748492","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4373409/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373409/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Orthogonal and Quasi-Orthogonal Designs in Wireless Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"53tit11-jing.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084728S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4373387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"4373387","articleId":"4373409","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4373410,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00d8rn Justesen","affiliation":["Danmarks Tekniske Universitet, Lyngby, DK"],"firstName":"J\u00d8rn","lastName":"Justesen","id":"37283164900"},{"name":"Tom Hoholdt","firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Hoholdt","id":"37326008500"},{"name":"Johann Hjaltason","firstName":"Johann","lastName":"Hjaltason","id":"37564691700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4373410","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":555},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We present an iterative list decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.

Since the suboptimal MMSE receiver becomes optimal for the case when the users are equally powered, our results show that the conjecture made by Tse and Zeitouni for the complex-spreading case is not affirmative.

Thus, it is important to characterize the statistics of the mutual information for realistic correlated channels. Here, a mathematical approach is presented, using the method of replicas, that provides analytic expressions not only for the average, but also for the higher moments of the distribution of the mutual information for the most general zero-mean Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels when the channel is known at the receiver. These channels include multitap delay paths, and channels with covariance matrices that cannot be written as a Kronecker product, such as general dual-polarized correlated antenna arrays. This approach is formally valid for large antenna numbers, in which case all cumulant moments of the distribution, other than the first two, scale to zero. In addition, it is shown that the replica-symmetric result is valid if the variance of the mutual information is positive and finite. In this case, it is shown that the distribution of the mutual information tends to a Gaussian, which enables the calculation of the outage capacity. These results are quite accurate even for few antennas, which makes this approach applicable to realistic situations.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.907468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4373387/04373419.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.907468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373387","startPage":"3887","endPage":"3903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Outage Capacity of Correlated Multiple-Path MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Outage Capacity of Correlated Multiple-Path MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373419/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9748502","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4373419/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Outage Capacity of Correlated Multiple-Path MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"53tit11-moustakas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170097S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4373387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4373387","articleId":"4373419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4373424,"authors":[{"name":"Tal Philosof","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Tal","lastName":"Philosof","id":"37283678500"},{"name":"Ram Zamir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Ram","lastName":"Zamir","id":"37284119000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4373424","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":376},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","MIMO","Gaussian noise","Transmitting antennas","Covariance matrix","Colored noise","Broadcasting","Context","Wireless communication","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity loss","uncorrelated Gaussian input","multiple-input multiple-output linear additive-noise channel","channel matrix","noise distribution","noise covariance","multiple-access channel","MIMO broadcast channel","multiuser configuration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity loss","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel","MIMO broadcast channel (MIMO-BC)","MIMO multiple-access channel (MIMO-MAC)","noncooperation loss","robust input","uncorrelation loss"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Cost of Uncorrelation and Noncooperation in MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373424","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.907512","startPage":"3904","endPage":"3920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4373387/04373424.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.907512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373387","abstract":"We investigate the capacity loss for using uncorrelated Gaussian input over a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear additive-noise channel.

Antenna selection reduces the complexity of the radio devices and requires only a small amount of channel state feedback. For high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we define excess rate as the constant term in the expansion of the ergodic capacity in terms of SNR. It is shown that this value is representative of the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. The asymptotic behavior of the excess rate is then analyzed for three cases: complete CSI, no CSI, and partial CSI at transmitter (antenna selection). While water-filling provides a excess rate that increases logarithmically in M (the number of transmit antennas), the excess rate of transmit antenna selection behaves only like log(log M). For the low SNR case, we use the concept of channel gain, a measure introduced by Verdu. We show that channel gain for antenna selection increases only logarithmically in M as opposed to water-filling channel gain which increases linearly in M. The same techniques are also applied to the receive selection, and corresponding results are noted in high- and low-SNR regimes. The methodology developed in this correspondence, although motivated by antenna selection, is fairly general and can be used for any system where partial CSI is available at the MIMO transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.907476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4373387/04373430.pdf","startPage":"4356","endPage":"4362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.907476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of MIMO Channels With Antenna Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373430/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of MIMO Channels With Antenna Selection","volume":"53","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9748512","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4373430/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of MIMO Channels With Antenna Selection","sourcePdf":"53tit11-sanayei2-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074944S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4373387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4373387","articleId":"4373430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4373431,"authors":[{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai","id":"37267375900"},{"name":"I.

In contrast to the conventional definition of rate, in the fountain setup the definition of rate penalizes the reception of symbols by the receiver rather than their transmission.

SFR matrices have been used lately as generator matrices for a family of space\u2013time trellis codes to achieve full diversity in asynchronous cooperative communications, where the numbers of columns of the SFR matrices correspond to the memory sizes of the trellis codes. A systematic construction of SFR matrices, including the shortest (square) SFR (SSFR) matrices, has been also previously proposed. In this paper, we study a variation of SFR matrices with a relaxed condition: limited-shift-full-rank (LT-SFR) matrices, i.e., the matrices that have full row rank no matter how their rows are shifted as long as the shifts are within some range called delay tolerance. As the generator matrices for the previously proposed space\u2013time trellis codes, LT-SFR matrices can guarantee asynchronous full diversity of the corresponding codes when the timing errors are within the delay tolerance. Therefore, due to the relaxed condition imposed on LT-SFR matrices, more eligible generator matrices than SFR matrices become available.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited-Shift-Full-Rank Matrices With Applications in Asynchronous Cooperative Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.907510","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4373387/04373432.pdf","startPage":"4119","endPage":"4126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.907510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Limited-Shift-Full-Rank Matrices With Applications in Asynchronous Cooperative Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4373432/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9748513","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited-Shift-Full-Rank Matrices With Applications in Asynchronous Cooperative Communications","sourcePdf":"53tit11-shang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106281S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4373387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4373387","articleId":"4373432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4373433,"authors":[{"name":"Eran Sharon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Eran","lastName":"Sharon","id":"37283962000"},{"name":"Simon Litsyn","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Litsyn","id":"37267257400"},{"name":"Jacob Goldberger","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Goldberger","id":"37283659000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4373433","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":101,"citationCountPatent":19,"totalDownloads":1505},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373433","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Processor scheduling","Iterative decoding","Floods","Tree graphs","Message passing","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Scheduling algorithm","Code standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","message passing","parity check codes","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["serial message-passing schedules","LDPC decoding","low-density parity-check decoding iteration","check nodes","flooding schedule","computation tree","asymptotic analysis","density evolution algorithm","LDPC codes","serial schedule","binary erasure channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Belief propagation","density evolution","factor graph","iterative decoding","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","message-passing decoding"]}],"abstract":"Conventionally, in each low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoding iteration all the variable nodes and subsequently all the check nodes send messages to their neighbors (flooding schedule). An alternative, more efficient, approach is to update the nodes' messages serially (serial schedule). A theoretical analysis of serial message passing decoding schedules is presented. In particular, the evolution of the computation tree under serial scheduling is analyzed. It shows that the tree grows twice as fast in comparison to the flooding schedule's one, indicating that the serial schedule propagates information twice as fast in the code's underlying graph. Furthermore, an asymptotic analysis of the serial schedule's convergence rate is done using the density evolution (DE) algorithm. Applied to various ensembles of LDPC codes, it shows that for long codes the serial schedule is expected to converge in half the number of iterations compared to the standard flooding schedule, when working near the ensemble's threshold. This observation is generally proved for the binary erasure channel (BEC) under some natural assumptions. Finally, an accompanying concentration theorem is proved.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2007.907507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2007.907507","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4373387/04373433.pdf","startPage":"4076","endPage":"4091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Serial Message-Passing Schedules for LDPC Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Serial Message-Passing Schedules for LDPC Decoding","volume":"53","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4373433/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9748514","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373433/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Serial Message-Passing Schedules for LDPC Decoding","sourcePdf":"53tit11-sharon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097678S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4373387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4373387","articleId":"4373433","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4373434,"authors":[{"name":"Wee Peng Tay","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Wee Peng","lastName":"Tay","id":"37625042400"},{"name":"John N.

These constructions establish a connection between good diagonal lattice space-time codes and number fields with small absolute values of discriminants. We present two tables for diversity products of some lattice space-time codes from these constructions. The maximal rank of diagonal lattice space-time codes with positive diversity product is determined. We also discuss the asymptotic problem of lattice space-time codes. By using an infinite tower of Hilbert class field and a tamely ramified class field tower, we obtain asymptotically good sequences of lattice space-time codes.

Output phase voltages of the MLID are used as diagnostic signals to detect faults and their locations. It is difficult to diagnose an MLID system using a mathematical model because MLID systems consist of many switching devices and their system complexity has a nonlinear factor. Therefore, a neural network (NN) classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of an MLID system. Multilayer perceptron networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults. The principal component analysis is utilized in the feature extraction process to reduce the NN input size. A lower dimensional input space will also usually reduce the time necessary to train an NN, and the reduced noise can improve the mapping performance. The genetic algorithm is also applied to select the valuable principal components. The proposed network is evaluated with simulation test set and experimental test set. The overall classification performance of the proposed network is more than 95%. A reconfiguration technique is also proposed. The proposed fault diagnostic system requires about six cycles to clear an open-circuit or short-circuit fault. The experimental results show that the proposed system performs satisfactorily to detect the fault type, fault location, and reconfiguration.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.906994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4352072/04373442.pdf","startPage":"2954","endPage":"2968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.906994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4352072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Diagnosis and Reconfiguration for Multilevel Inverter Drive Using AI-Based Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373442/","displayDocTitle":"Fault Diagnosis and Reconfiguration for Multilevel Inverter Drive Using AI-Based Techniques","volume":"54","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9681907","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4373442/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Diagnosis and Reconfiguration for Multilevel Inverter Drive Using AI-Based Techniques","sourcePdf":"54tie06-khomfoi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079736S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4352072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"4352072","articleId":"4373442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4373443,"authors":[{"name":"Dietmar Krug","affiliation":["Siemens AG, Automation and Drives, Nuremberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4352072/4373443/4373443-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dietmar Krug received the Diploma degree in electrical engineering from the Berlin University of Technology, Berlin, Germany, in 2001.

Recently, such converters have been the subject of extensive research due to their suitability for high-power applications. One requirement in using a multilevel active rectifier at high levels of power is to limit the switching losses by reducing the switching frequency to a minimum. Another requirement for these converters is to ensure that individual dc link capacitor voltages for each cell of the converter are always balanced to ensure controllability and to limit stress on the converter cells. This paper presents a complete method in solving both of these problems using a selective-harmonic-elimination pulsewidth-modulation scheme. The scheme utilizes a simple controller to track each cell dc link capacitor voltage magnitude and accordingly biases the power flowing into each cell to ensure that the voltages across each cell capacitor converge. This is the case even when the loads attached to the individual cells are not balanced. The theory is supported by both simulated results from Saber and by experimental results from a seven-level CHB single-phase multilevel rectifier.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.906993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4352072","startPage":"2946","endPage":"2953","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4352072/04373444.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.906993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Complete Harmonic Elimination Approach to DC Link Voltage Balancing for a Cascaded Multilevel Rectifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectifiers","Capacitors","Voltage control","Circuit topology","Switching loss","Analog-digital conversion","Switching frequency","Controllability","Stress","Power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonics suppression","power conversion harmonics","PWM power convertors","PWM rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["selective-harmonic-elimination pulsewidth-modulation scheme","DC link capacitor voltage magnitude","converter cells","multilevel active rectifier","single-phase CHB rectifier","cascaded H-Bridge multilevel rectifier","DC link voltage balancing","complete harmonic elimination approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel converter","selective harmonic elimination (SHE)","voltage balancing control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Complete Harmonic Elimination Approach to DC Link Voltage Balancing for a Cascaded Multilevel Rectifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373444/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 October 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4373444/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9681912","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Complete Harmonic Elimination Approach to DC Link Voltage Balancing for a Cascaded Multilevel Rectifier","sourcePdf":"54tie06-watson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113211S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4352072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"4352072","articleId":"4373444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4373510,"authors":[{"name":"Walid A.

The room is modelled with all its components (water & heating pipes, windows, electrical outlets, brick walls, barred windows, etc.). The radar setup is also modelled to simulate a realistic system. The performance of the UWB radar is examined by generating 2-dimensional (2D) images of the room interior with the human body model included. This is done by considering monostatic and multistatic radar scenarios where responses are recorded and processed using the time-domain back-projection method. Images from the FDTD modelling detected the human body model at the correct location inside the room. As expected, the multistatic radar setup provided a cleaner image than that of the monostatic radar setup due to greater diversity in aspect angle.","doi":"10.1109/CEMTD.2007.4373510","publicationTitle":"2007 Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in Time-Domain","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in Time-Domain","pdfPath":"/iel5/4373508/4373509/04373510.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEMTD.2007.4373510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD Modelling of a Realistic Room for Through-the-Wall Radar Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373510/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD Modelling of a Realistic Room for Through-the-Wall Radar Applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824449","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4373510/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD Modelling of a Realistic Room for Through-the-Wall Radar Applications","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"CEMTD-00-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065207S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4373508","isNumber":"4373509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4373508","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4373509","articleId":"4373510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4373512,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The proposed model is based on the concept of the effective wave impedance of the PML. This concept implies that the wave impedance in the discretized space changes, with respect to the continuous value, when absorption occurs. These changes are dependent on the PML absorption per unit length as well as on the cell size. The validity of the proposed model has been checked with numerical simulations in coaxial waveguide geometry. One of the important consequences of the proposed modeling scheme is the feasibility of a PML with, ideally, no return losses due to discretization error. This prediction has also been corroborated by numerical simulations; being the improvement of the PML return losses of about 30 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and minimization of discretization error in one-dimensional PML's using FDTD","publicationTitle":"2007 Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in Time-Domain","doi":"10.1109/CEMTD.2007.4373512","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in Time-Domain","pdfPath":"/iel5/4373508/4373509/04373512.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEMTD.2007.4373512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and minimization of discretization error in one-dimensional PML's using FDTD","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4373512/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9860020","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and minimization of discretization error in one-dimensional PML's using FDTD","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"CEMTD-00-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033513S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4373508","isNumber":"4373509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4373508","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4373509","articleId":"4373512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4373518,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Ciamulski","affiliation":["ITM, Electronic Design Division, Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ciamulski","id":"37266821900"},{"name":"Mats Hjelm","affiliation":["ITM, Electronic Design Division, Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Hjelm","id":"37321519700"},{"name":"Maciej Sypniewski","affiliation":["Radioelectronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Maciej","lastName":"Sypniewski","id":"37266746300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1169-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1170-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4373518","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Concurrent computing","Memory architecture","Samarium","Computer architecture","Parallel processing","Delta modulation","Computational modeling","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed memory systems","finite difference time-domain analysis","memory architecture","multiprocessing programs","parallel processing","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel FDTD calculation","shared memory architecture","parallel processing","multiprocessor computer architectures","distributed memory systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic analysis","FDTD methods","parallel algorithms","parallel processing","shared memory systems","distributed memory systems"]}],"abstract":"Fast parallel processing of the FDTD method is becoming very important, and its efficiency on different multiprocessor computer architectures should be carefully examined.

In this contribution, an existing thin wire formalism is generalised in order to allow complete microstrip and printed circuits to be modelled in an efficient and rigorous manner.","doi":"10.1109/CEMTD.2007.4373533","publicationTitle":"2007 Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in Time-Domain","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in Time-Domain","pdfPath":"/iel5/4373508/4373509/04373533.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEMTD.2007.4373533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373509","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inclusion of Microstrip and Wire Circuits in the FDTD Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Inclusion of Microstrip and Wire Circuits in the FDTD Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373533/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824461","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4373533/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inclusion of Microstrip and Wire Circuits in the FDTD Method","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"CEMTD-00-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04589S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4373508","isNumber":"4373509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4373508","xplore-issue":"4373509","articleId":"4373533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4373537,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Semnani","affiliation":["K.N.

We show that the method can lead to less than -120 dB leakage errors in the scattered field region, which are comparable to results from other recently proposed methods. A simple explanation for this very good performance is provided, relating it to the numerical dispersion matching technique. Extension of the method to three dimensional (3-D) geometries is also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in Time-Domain","pdfPath":"/iel5/4373508/4373509/04373540.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2007 Workshop on Computational Electromagnetics in Time-Domain","doi":"10.1109/CEMTD.2007.4373540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEMTD.2007.4373540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373509","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review of an FDTD TF/SF Formulation Based on Auxiliary 1-D grids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic scattering","Interpolation","Computational modeling","Page description languages","Dispersion","Educational institutions","Computer errors","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","inhomogeneous media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD TF/SF formulation","total field formulations","scattered field formulations","finite difference time domain","multiple auxiliary 1D grids","layered media","leakage errors","3D geometries"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite difference time domain methods","plane waves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Review of an FDTD TF/SF Formulation Based on Auxiliary 1-D grids","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4373540/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9824465","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of an FDTD TF/SF Formulation Based on Auxiliary 1-D grids","confLoc":"Perugia, Italy","sourcePdf":"CEMTD-00-31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038134S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4373508","isNumber":"4373509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4373508","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4373509","articleId":"4373540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4373542,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406288100"},{"name":"Woo-Tae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo-Tae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278279200"},{"name":"Il-Suek Koh","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology & Telecommunication, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Il-Suek","lastName":"Koh","id":"37276735500"},{"name":"Jong-Gwan Yook","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Gwan","lastName":"Yook","id":"37277003100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1169-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1170-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4373542","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"abstract":"This paper reviews ADI ID-FDTD and CN ID-FDTD methods, the implicit FDTD methods based on isotropic dispersion finite difference (IDFD) scheme reported in [1] and [2].

Each channel has an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), data-buffers and I/O interface. We use multi-channel modules to carry out interleaved sampling for obtaining multiple waveforms sampling during an interval. In the design example we used four sets of ADCs, data-buffers and three I/O interface ICs to construct an interleaved sampling by four-channels. We use a fraction of a clock period as the delay time of each channel, and through merging the four sets of sampling waveform data arrive at the measured waveform. Theoretically, the interleaved sampling of four-channel merging should be able to broaden the bandwidth of an embedded oscilloscope system by 400%. If the bandwidth of an oscilloscope is higher, the price is also higher. The cost of an oscilloscope is in proportion to the bandwidth by an exponential relation, not by a linear one. If we use an interleaved sampling design to increase the bandwidth by 100%, we only need to add a set of ADC and data-buffers besides the cost of the basic embedded system.

Especially for an assembly process that handles complicated mechanical alignments of many tiny objects in the three-dimensional space, a proper identification of the alignment errors and a fast decision of manipulation plan should be guaranteed in order to keep the manufacturing costs in an affordable range. In most of the current precise manufacturing processes, identification of the misalignment is normally carried out by machine vision systems. And the limited data process speed of the vision system usually hampers enhancement of overall system performance. In the present work, a modified binary region median filter combined with a labeling based segmentation scheme for the enhancement of a machine vision system is introduced. The suggested algorithm shows not only shows improved data processing speed but provides a better accuracy on the identification of a target object.","publicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Robotic and Sensors Environments","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Robotic and Sensors Environments","pdfPath":"/iel5/4373951/4373952/04373959.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ROSE.2007.4373959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROSE.2007.4373959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced Vision Processing Algorithm for a Micro-manipulation System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Vision Processing Algorithm for a Micro-manipulation System","htmlLink":"/document/4373959/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"10105918","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-13 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Vision Processing Algorithm for a Micro-manipulation System","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"ROSE-00-7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062257S","chronDate":"12-13 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4373951","isNumber":"4373952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4373951","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4373952","articleId":"4373959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4373967,"authors":[{"name":"Hicham Chaoui","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hicham","lastName":"Chaoui","id":"37273376100"},{"name":"Wail Gueaieb","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Wail","lastName":"Gueaieb","id":"37294232300"},{"name":"Mustapha C.E.

The online adaptation of the RBF neural network is is accomplished through two methods: (i) the least mean squares (LMS), and (ii) the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms. A comparison study is conducted to evaluate the efficiency of both algorithms on the tracking ability of the proposed control scheme.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive power control algorithm, which is easier implemented than widely used algorithms, for uplink of the power control module through a simple and reliable way. Our method is based on the step size fixed power control algorithm and we use a shift register in the receiver to deposit power control bits, on which we depend to regulate the power-adjusting step size adaptively. First, we define that the bit information be 1 or 0, if the receiving power is smaller or bigger than the target power. When there is 1 or 0 alternately, it means the receiving power is approximate to the target power. When there is 1 or 0 continuously, the step size needs adjusting strongly, for the receiving power is much smaller or bigger. By simulating our algorithm and the step size fixed power control algorithm in the physical layer simulation platform of TD-SCDMA system, we can see the adaptive algorithm has a better performance than the step size fixed algorithm in decreasing the Bit Error Rate (BER) of information transmission. The simulation results also show that system performance may be affected by different number of users and Doppler shift and this adaptive algorithm is applicable to small Doppler shift with the same Signal Noise Raito (SNR) to the step size fixed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation Analysis of Adaptive Power Control Method in TD-SCDMA System","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SIEDS.2007.4373989","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4373983/4373984/04373989.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIEDS.2007.4373989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4373989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4373989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Simulation Analysis of Adaptive Power Control Method in TD-SCDMA System","conferenceDate":"27-27 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4373989/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9776529","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation Analysis of Adaptive Power Control Method in TD-SCDMA System","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"SIEDS-00-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056817S","chronDate":"27-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4373983","isNumber":"4373984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4373983","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4373984","articleId":"4373989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4374005,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey T.

The Sentinel system is comprised of a robust anomaly detection back-end program built around a zero modified Poisson model and a user-friendly web interface. The back-end program constantly monitors user specified crime levels over time and automatically alerts users via the web interface when these crime levels change significantly. This tool has been completed and integrated into the Web-based criminal analysis toolkit (WebCAT), a criminal analysis program developed by the Systems Engineering Department at the University of Virginia. Although more long term comprehensive testing remains, initial results show that the tool provides a more accurate, time efficient method of detecting anomalies in criminal data sets than currently exists.","doi":"10.1109/SIEDS.2007.4374005","pdfPath":"/iel5/4373983/4373984/04374005.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIEDS.2007.4374005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4373984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Automated Anomaly Detection System for Crime","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Automated Anomaly Detection System for Crime","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2007","accessionNumber":"9776545","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374005/","conferenceDate":"27-27 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of an Automated Anomaly Detection System for Crime","confLoc":"Charlottesville, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"SIEDS-00-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040103S","chronDate":"27-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4373983","isNumber":"4373984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4373983","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4373984","articleId":"4374005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4374040,"authors":[{"name":"Sangshin Kwak","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Daegu University, Daegu, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/4374037/4374040/4374040-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sangshin Kwak (S'02\u2013M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2005.","From 1999 to 2000, he was a Research Engineer at LG Electronics, Changwon, Korea.

The fault compensation is achieved by reconfiguring the matrix converter topology with the help of a connecting device. Based on the redefined converter structure, a fault-tolerant modulation algorithm is developed to reshape output currents of two unfaulty phases for obtaining continuous operation.

based on high-order statistics is proposed for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery. First, KPCA is performed on the original hyperspectral data to fully mine the high-order correlation between spectral bands. Then, the average local singularity (LS) is defined based on the high-order statistics in the local sliding window, which is used as a measure for selecting the most informative nonlinear component for anomaly detection. By the selective KPCA, information on anomalous targets is extracted to maximum extent, and background clutters are well suppressed in the selected component. Finally, the selected component with maximum average LS is used as input for anomaly detectors. Numerical experiments are conducted on real hyperspectral images collected by the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer. The results strongly prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Selective KPCA Algorithm Based on High-Order Statistics for Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2007.907304","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4432580/04374066.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2007.907304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Selective KPCA Algorithm Based on High-Order Statistics for Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4374066/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9977878","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Selective KPCA Algorithm Based on High-Order Statistics for Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"05lgrs01-gu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056999S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4432580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4432580","articleId":"4374066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374068,"authors":[{"name":"Yanping Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yanping","lastName":"Li","id":"37292398800"},{"name":"Zhenhua Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292206300"},{"name":"Mengdao Xing","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Mengdao","lastName":"Xing","id":"37300837500"},{"name":"Zheng Bao","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Bao","id":"37274384700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4374068","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Azimuth","Signal processing algorithms","Interpolation","Transmitters","Focusing","Data processing","Frequency domain analysis","Computational efficiency","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear approximation","bistatic range cell migration factor","bistatic frequency-scaling algorithm","monostatic FSA","bistatic point target spectrum","bistatic spotlight SAR data processing","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bistatic synthetic aperture radar","frequency-scaling algorithm (FSA)","radar imaging"]},{"kwd":["Bistatic synthetic aperture radar","frequency-scaling algorithm (FSA)","radar imaging"]}],"abstract":"This letter derives the bistatic point target spectrum for the translational invariant case.

On those studies, the soft errors were considered to arrive following a Poissonian basis and they were assumed to be single uncorrelated events (each event causes only one soft error). Recent studies suggest that multiple bit upsets (MBUs) are a significant part of the error events in advanced memory technologies and that they will continue to grow in the next technology nodes. The errors in an MBU are normally caused by the same physical event and therefore affect memory cells that are close together. This poses a major problem to memories that are protected with per-word single error correction codes, as an MBU is likely to affect two or more bits in the same word, causing an uncorrectable error. To avoid that problem, interleaving is used to ensure that cells that are physically close together belong to different logical words, so that the errors in an MBU are distributed over a number of words each suffering only one error. Although some works have been done that characterize memories under radiation tests, no mathematical model of the effect of MBUs on the reliability of a memory has been proposed in the literature, to the best of the authors' knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, the reliability of memories suffering MBUs is analyzed in detail. The fundamental result from that analysis is that the MTTF of a memory exposed to MBUs can be approximated using the existing results for single event upsets by adjusting the error arrival rate.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/4403236/04374082.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Analysis of Memories Suffering Multiple Bit Upsets","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2007.910443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4403236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2007.910443","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Analysis of Memories Suffering Multiple Bit Upsets","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9756486","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4374082/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Analysis of Memories Suffering Multiple Bit Upsets","sourcePdf":"07tdmr04-reviriego.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095579S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"4403236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4403236","articleId":"4374082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374083,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Jung Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/4403236/4374083/4374083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun-Jung Tang was born in Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1982.

We find that in certain stress conditions, the NBT-induced current instability evolves from enhancement mode to degradation mode, giving rise to an anomalous turn-around characteristic with stress time and stress gate voltage. Persistent poststress drain current degradation is found in a pMOSFET, as opposed to drain current recovery in its n-type MOSFET counterpart. A bipolar charge trapping model along with trap generation in a HfSiON gate dielectric is proposed to account for the observed phenomena. Poststress single charge emissions from trap states in HfSiON are characterized. Charge pumping and carrier separation measurements are performed to support our model. The impact of NBT stress voltage, temperature, and time on drain current instability mode is evaluated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/4403236/04374083.pdf","startPage":"518","endPage":"523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2007.910436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2007.910436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4403236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bipolar Charge Trapping Induced Anomalous Negative Bias-Temperature Instability in HfSiON Gate Dielectric pMOSFETs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Degradation","Voltage","Measurement techniques","MOSFET circuits","Charge pumps","Current measurement","Dielectric measurements","Charge measurement","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hafnium compounds","high-k dielectric thin films","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar charge trapping","negative bias-temperature instability","HfSiON gate dielectric pMOSFETs","stress-induced drain current instability","poststress single charge emissions","carrier separation","drain current instability","HfSION"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bipolar charge trapping","HfSiON","negative bias temperature (NBT) instability","single charge emission"]},{"kwd":["HfSiON","negative bias temperature instability","bipolar charge trapping","single charge emission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2007","displayDocTitle":"Bipolar Charge Trapping Induced Anomalous Negative Bias-Temperature Instability in HfSiON Gate Dielectric pMOSFETs","volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4374083/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9756487","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bipolar Charge Trapping Induced Anomalous Negative Bias-Temperature Instability in HfSiON Gate Dielectric pMOSFETs","sourcePdf":"07tdmr04-tang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068608S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"4403236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4403236","articleId":"4374083","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374085,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["Munich Design Center, Qimonda GmbH, Munich, Germany","Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium","Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/4403236/4374085/4374085-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Louvain, Belgium, in 2007.","He carried out his doctoral research at the Interuniversity Microelectronics Center, Louvain.

Among them, the progressive gate-oxide soft breakdown (SBD) in the negative-channel field-effect transistors is foreseen to be a big issue for the deep-deep submicron technologies, where ultrathin gate oxide and low supply (stress) voltage will be massively deployed. Device-level investigation has largely confirmed that the SBD defect will not lead to an issue for the transistor functionality. In addition, simple gate-level characterization also indicates that the SBD defect in those gates only leads to performance degradation. Up to now, the impact of the random nature with such effect is not yet well understood at a complex circuit block or component level. In this paper, we have focused our analysis in providing insights on the SBD impact on sensitive static random access memory (SRAM) components as well as the complete matrix. Results have shown a significant shift in the performance figures of the blocks, which endangers the SRAM parametric yield. The drift becomes even worse when the process variability effect is taken into account. All the results indicate urgent needs to develop effective countermeasures by both the technology and design sides.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Random Soft Oxide Breakdown on SRAM Energy/Delay Drift","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2007.910444","startPage":"581","endPage":"591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2007.910444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4403236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/4403236/04374085.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Random Soft Oxide Breakdown on SRAM Energy/Delay Drift","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4374085/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9742821","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Random Soft Oxide Breakdown on SRAM Energy/Delay Drift","sourcePdf":"07tdmr04-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074745S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"4403236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4403236","articleId":"4374085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374087,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Sheng Yan","affiliation":["Joint Research Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yan received the B.S. degree in physics and the M.S. degree in acoustics both from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong, SAR, in 2005.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Joint Research Center for Biomedical Engineering, CUHK.

The simulation shows that the new algorithm MCDST is more robust under low SNRs than the clinically verified motion-resistant algorithm discrete saturation transform (DST). Further, the experiment with different severity of motions demonstrates that MCDST has a slightly better performance than DST algorithm. Moreover, MCDST is more computationally efficient than DST because the former uses linear algebra instead of the time-consuming adaptive filter used by latter, which indicates that MCDST can reduce the required power consumption and circuit complexity of the implementation. This is vital for wearable devices, where the physical size and long battery life are crucial.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2007.902173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/4512079/04374087.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2007.902173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4512079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Motion-Resistant Method for Wearable Pulse Oximeter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Motion-Resistant Method for Wearable Pulse Oximeter","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9980932","pubMedId":"18693507","htmlLink":"/document/4374087/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Motion-Resistant Method for Wearable Pulse Oximeter","sourcePdf":"12titb03-yan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074549S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"4512079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4512079","articleId":"4374087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374093,"authors":[{"name":"Eyal Omer","affiliation":["Tahal Consulting Engineers Limited, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Eyal","lastName":"Omer","id":"37960922800"},{"name":"Rami Guetta","affiliation":["Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Guetta","id":"37947262700"},{"name":"Ilya Ioslovich","affiliation":["Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Ilya","lastName":"Ioslovich","id":"37547927900"},{"name":"Per-Olof Gutman","affiliation":["Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Per-Olof","lastName":"Gutman","id":"37300816900"},{"name":"Michael Borshchevsky","affiliation":["Faculty of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Borshchevsky","id":"37947266300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8969"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0059"}],"articleNumber":"4374093","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374093","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Poles and towers","Piecewise linear techniques","Algorithm design and analysis","Reservoirs","Spraying","Water resources","Costs","Solar energy","Ocean temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid power systems","linear programming","power generation planning","solar power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy tower power plant","solar energy","seawater","hot dry desert air","optimization algorithm","water reservoirs","linear programming problem","quasiNewton algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy management","optimization methods","power system modeling","power system planning"]},{"kwd":["Energy management","optimization methods","power system modeling","power system planning"]}],"abstract":"The energy tower (ET) is a power plant that uses seawater and solar energy accumulated in hot dry desert air to produce electricity.

The inverter is universal in the sense that it can be switched between buck, boost, and buck--boost configurations by appropriately altering the pulse width modular (PWM) control. Discontinuous current mode (DCM) operation is implemented to facilitate shuffling between configurations during the converter operation. Such flexibility ensures maximum benefit of the buck, boost, and the buck--boost operations (e.g., low device stresses, higher efficiency, higher boosting capability, etc.). The PWM is achieved by comparing a high frequency carrier (triangular) waveform with a suitable reference waveform, which is not necessarily sinusoidal, but has a shape specific to the individual configuration and is derived by equating the power fed into the grid with that extracted from the source during each switching cycle. The values of the components (inductors and capacitors) need to be optimized so that DCM is maintained and the required amount of energy is transferred to the grid in all the three configurations during their respective operation. All the design expressions have been derived. A salient feature of this inverter is its compatibility with various types of sources (PV array, fuel cell, etc.) with varying voltage levels and control requirements. Being single-stage, the proposed topology offers additional advantages like modularity, compactness, and low cost.

Simultaneous reduction of 26-dB third-order intermodulation distortion and 7-dB laser-noise reduction is achieved at 5.2 GHz, leading to enhanced spurious-free dynamic range of 107 dB (1 Hz) in a directly modulated uncooled semiconductor laser for applications in wireless-over-fiber (WoF) systems. This paper also provides detailed analysis on feedforward, theoretical distortion reduction, criteria for component selection, and the effect of dispersion. The effectiveness of feedforward in a multichannel system is demonstrated at 5.8 GHz for fixed wireless systems, such as WiMAX.

especially for the liver. To acquire 3D US data of the liver, the tip of a laparoscopic ultrasound probe is tracked inside the abdominal cavity using a magnetic tracker. The accuracy of magnetic trackers, however, is greatly affected by magnetic field distortion that results from the close proximity of metal objects and electronic equipment, which is usually unavoidable in the operating room. In this paper, we describe a calibration method for intraoperative magnetic distortion that can be applied to laparoscopic 3D US data acquisition; we evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of the method by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Although calibration data can be acquired freehand using a magneto-optic hybrid tracker, there are two problems associated with this method - error caused by the time delay between measurements of the optical and magnetic trackers, and instability of the calibration accuracy that results from the uniformity and density of calibration data. A temporal calibration procedure is developed to estimate the time delay, which is then integrated into the calibration, and a distortion model is formulated by zeroth-degree to fourth-degree polynomial fitting to the calibration data. In the in vivo experiment using a pig, the positional error caused by magnetic distortion was reduced from 44.1 to 2.9 mm. The standard deviation of corrected target positions was less than 1.0 mm. Freehand acquisition of calibration data was performed smoothly using a magneto-optic hybrid sampling tool through a trocar under guidance by realtime 3-D monitoring of the tool trajectory; data acquisition time was less than 2 min. The present study suggests that our proposed method could correct for magnetic field distortion inside the patient's abdomen during a laparoscopic procedure within a clinically permissible period of time, as well as enabling an accurate 3D US reconstruction to be obtained that can be superimposed onto live endoscopic images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intraoperative Magnetic Tracker Calibration Using a Magneto-Optic Hybrid Tracker for 3-D Ultrasound-Based Navigation in Laparoscopic Surgery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2007.911003","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4443147/04374097.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2007.911003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4443147","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374097/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Intraoperative Magnetic Tracker Calibration Using a Magneto-Optic Hybrid Tracker for 3-D Ultrasound-Based Navigation in Laparoscopic Surgery","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4374097/","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9747916","pubMedId":"18334447","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intraoperative Magnetic Tracker Calibration Using a Magneto-Optic Hybrid Tracker for 3-D Ultrasound-Based Navigation in Laparoscopic Surgery","sourcePdf":"27tmi02-nakamoto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.229439S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4443147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4443147","articleId":"4374097","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374101,"authors":[{"name":"Jamie W.

Precise, accurate, and stable signals are essential for deep-space communication and tracking, and syntonized and synchronized reference signals from atomic clocks calibrated to coordinated universal time must often be distributed over large distances. Fiber-optic technologies developed at the jet propulsion laboratory have resulted in several operational signal transport capabilities that enable precise spacecraft navigation and sensitive radio science experiments. These techniques are now finding further applicability in metrology applications to remotely compare ultra stable microwave and optical atomic clocks and for antenna array X- and Ka-band signal transport applications where temporal phase stability and alignment are critical.

With the advent of multislice computed tomography (CT), many IGIs are now being performed under volumetric CT guidance. Registering pre-and intraprocedural images for improved intraprocedural target delineation is a fundamental need in the IGI workflow. Earlier approaches to meet this need primarily employed rigid body approximation, which may not be valid because of nonrigid tissue misalignment between these images. Intensity-based automatic deformable registration is a promising option to correct for this misalignment; however, the long execution times of these algorithms have prevented their use in clinical workflow. This article presents a field-programmable gate array-based architecture for accelerated implementation of mutual information (Ml)-based deformable registration. The reported implementation reduces the execution time of MI-based deformable registration from hours to a few minutes. This work also demonstrates successful registration of abdominal intraprocedural noncontrast CT (iCT) images with preprocedural contrast-enhanced CT (preCT) and positron emission tomography (PET) images using the reported solution. The registration accuracy for this application was evaluated using 5 iCT-preCT and 5 iCT-PET image pairs. The registration accuracy of the hardware implementation is comparable with that achieved using a software implementation and is on the order of a few millimeters. This registration accuracy, coupled with the execution speed and compact implementation of the reported solution, makes it suitable for integration in the IGI-workflow.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2007.909023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/4375303/04374111.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4375303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2007.909023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Accelerated Deformable Image Registration for Improved Target-Delineation During CT-Guided Interventions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Accelerated Deformable Image Registration for Improved Target-Delineation During CT-Guided Interventions","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374111/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9748310","pubMedId":"23851666","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Accelerated Deformable Image Registration for Improved Target-Delineation During CT-Guided Interventions","sourcePdf":"01tbcas02-dandekar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172958S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"4375303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4375303","articleId":"4374111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":4374112,"authors":[{"name":"Awais M.

In this paper, we propose a methodology to analyze the stability of an SRAM cell in the presence of random fluctuations in the device parameters. First, we develop a theoretical framework for characterizing the dc noise margin of a memory cell. The framework is based on the concept that an SRAM cell is on the verge of instability when the gain across the loop formed by the cross-coupled inverters in the cell is unity. The noise margin criteria developed in this manner can be used to verify a cell stability in the presence of arbitrary DC noise offsets at the two storage nodes in the cell. We also develop metrics for estimating the cell stability during read and write operations and verify these models by extensive Monte Carlo simulations in a 65-nm CMOS process. Our results show that the proposed robustness metrics can be used to estimate cell failure probabilities in an efficient and accurate manner.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.909792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4407531/04374119.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.909792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4407531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of Random Device Variation on SRAM Cell Stability in Sub-90-nm CMOS Technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374119/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Random Device Variation on SRAM Cell Stability in Sub-90-nm CMOS Technologies","volume":"16","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9742769","htmlLink":"/document/4374119/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Random Device Variation on SRAM Cell Stability in Sub-90-nm CMOS Technologies","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi01-agarwal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067661S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4407531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4407531","articleId":"4374119","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4374120,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Asadi","affiliation":["Reliability Engineering Group, EMC Corporation, Hopkinton, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4380266/4374120/4374120-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hossein Asadi (S'04) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, in 2007.","He is currently with the Reliability Engineering Group, EMC Corporation, Hopkinton, MA, where he works on modeling the impact of soft errors on storage systems.

This model addresses the following issue. The path delay fault model captures small extra delays, such that each one by itself will not cause the circuit to fail, but their cumulative effect along a path from inputs to outputs can result in faulty behavior. However, non-robust tests for path delay faults may not detect situations where the cumulative effect of small extra delays is sufficient to cause faulty behavior after any number of extra delays are accumulated along a subpath. Under the new path delay fault model, a path delay fault is detected when all the single transition faults along the path are detected by the same test. This ensures that if the accumulation of small extra delays along a subpath is sufficient to cause faulty behavior, the faulty behavior will be detected due to the detection of a transition fault at the end of the subpath. We discuss the new model and present experimental results to demonstrate its viability as an alternative to the standard path delay fault model. We describe an efficient fault simulation procedure for this model. We also describe test generation procedures. An efficient test generation procedure we discuss combines tests for transition faults along the target paths in order to obtain tests that satisfy the requirements of the new model.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4407531/04374122.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.909796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.909796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4407531","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transition Path Delay Faults: A New Path Delay Fault Model for Small and Large Delay Defects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Delay effects","Circuit testing","Fault detection","Electrical fault detection","Circuit analysis","Circuit simulation","Delay lines","Cities and towns","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","fault simulation","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transition path delay fault model","nonrobust tests","cumulative effect","circuit faulty behavior","single transition faults","fault detection","test generation procedures","delay defects","fault simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay defects","fault simulation","path delay faults","test generation","transition faults"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2007","displayDocTitle":"Transition Path Delay Faults: A New Path Delay Fault Model for Small and Large Delay Defects","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4374122/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10075821","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transition Path Delay Faults: A New Path Delay Fault Model for Small and Large Delay Defects","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi01-pomeranz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141344S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4407531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4407531","articleId":"4374122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4374125,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Klein","affiliation":["Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4376239/4374125/4374125-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Klein studied mechanical engineering at the University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.

The coordinate mapping that relates the two images is found using an iterative optimization procedure. This work compares the performance of eight optimization methods: gradient descent (with two different step size selection algorithms), quasi-Newton, nonlinear conjugate gradient, Kiefer-Wolfowitz, simultaneous perturbation, Robbins-Monro, and evolution strategy. Special attention is paid to computation time reduction by using fewer voxels to calculate the cost function and its derivatives. The optimization methods are tested on manually deformed CT images of the heart, on follow-up CT chest scans, and on MR scans of the prostate acquired using a BFFE, Tl, and T2 protocol. Registration accuracy is assessed by computing the overlap of segmented edges. Precision and convergence properties are studied by comparing deformation fields. The results show that the Robbins-Monro method is the best choice in most applications. With this approach, the computation time per iteration can be lowered approximately 500 times without affecting the rate of convergence by using a small subset of the image, randomly selected in every iteration, to compute the derivative of the mutual information. From the other methods the quasi-Newton and the nonlinear conjugate gradient method achieve a slightly higher precision, at the price of larger computation times.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.909412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4376239/04374125.pdf","startPage":"2879","endPage":"2890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.909412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Optimization Methods for Nonrigid Medical Image Registration Using Mutual Information and B-Splines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374125/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Optimization Methods for Nonrigid Medical Image Registration Using Mutual Information and B-Splines","volume":"16","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9674204","pubMedId":"18092588","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374125/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Optimization Methods for Nonrigid Medical Image Registration Using Mutual Information and B-Splines","sourcePdf":"16tip12-klein.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163947S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4376239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"261","xplore-issue":"4376239","articleId":"4374125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":4374135,"authors":[{"name":"Tomonobu Senjyu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Tomonobu Senjyu (A'89\u2013M'02\u2013SM'06) was born in Saga, Japan, in 1963.

Many of the distributed generations are set up in the vicinity of the customer, with the advantage that this decreases transmission losses. However, output power generated from natural energy, such as wind power, photovoltaics, etc., which is distributed generation, is influenced by meteorological conditions. Therefore, when the distributed generation increases by conventional control techniques, it is expected that the voltage change of each node becomes a problem. Proposed in this paper is the optimal control of distribution voltage with coordination of distributed installations, such as the load ratio control transformer, step voltage regulator (SVR), shunt capacitor, shunt reactor, and static var compensator. In this research, SVR is assumed to be a model with tap changing where the signal is received from a central control unit.

Firstly, based on product theorem for the FRFT, the sampling theorems and reconstruction formulas are derived, which explain how to sample a continuous-time signal to obtain its discrete-time version for band limited signals in the fractional Fourier domain. Secondly, the formulas and significance of decimation and interpolation are studied in the fractional Fourier domain. Using the results, the sampling rate conversion theory for the FRFT with a rational fraction as conversion factor is deduced, which illustrates how to sample the discrete-time version without aliasing. The theorems proposed in this study are the generalizations of the conventional versions for the Fourier transform.

In our scheme, updates of the haptic amplitude values are signaled across the network only if the change of a haptic stimulus is detectable by the human operator. We investigate haptic data communication for a 1 degree-of-freedom (DoF) and a 3 DoF teleaction system.

It is assumed that the signal power decays as a function of the distance from the target. For both the case where the total number of sensors is known and the wireless channels are lossless, and the case where the number of sensors is random and the wireless channels have nonnegligible error rates, the exact system level probability of detection is derived analytically. Some approximation methods are also proposed to attain an accurate estimate of the probability of detection, while at the same time to reduce the computation load significantly. To obtain a better system level detection performance, the local sensor level decision threshold is determined such that it maximizes the system level deflection coefficient.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Distributed Detection in a Random Sensor Field","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.906770","endPage":"349","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4407637/04374152.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.906770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4407637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374152","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor fusion","Sensor systems","Testing","Error analysis","Approximation methods","Military computing","Surveillance","Data security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","sensor fusion","signal detection","statistical testing","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","distributed random sensor field detection","wireless sensor network","hypothesis testing","wireless channel","error probability","sensor level decision threshold","system level deflection coefficient","counting rule","decision fusion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Counting rule","decision fusion","distributed detection","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Distributed Detection in a Random Sensor Field","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4374152/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9742688","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Distributed Detection in a Random Sensor Field","sourcePdf":"56tsp01-niu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097118S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4407637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"4407637","articleId":"4374152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":4374154,"authors":[{"name":"Jennifer Seberry","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Centre for Computer and Information Security Research, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4407637/4374154/4374154-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jennifer Seberry (M'89\u2013SM'97) received the Ph.D. degree in computation mathematics from La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia, in 1971.","She has subsequently held positions at the Australian National University, the University of Sydney and the Australian Defense Force Academy (ADFA), The University of New South Wales.

The algorithm uses a set of maximum-likelihood (ML) trained HMM models as a baseline system, and an SVM training scheme to rescore the results of the baseline HMMs. It turns out that the rescoring model can be represented as an unnormalized HMM. We describe two algorithms for training the unnormalized HMM models for both the discrete and continuous cases. One of the algorithms results in a single set of unnormalized HMMs that can be used in the standard recognition procedure (the Viterbi recognizer), as if they were plain HMMs. We use a toy problem and an isolated noisy digit recognition task to compare our new method to standard ML training. Our experiments show that SVM rescoring of hidden Markov models typically reduces the error rate significantly compared to standard ML training.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.906741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4407637/04374155.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.906741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4407637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Vector Machine Training for Improved Hidden Markov Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374155/","displayDocTitle":"Support Vector Machine Training for Improved Hidden Markov Modeling","volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9742697","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374155/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support Vector Machine Training for Improved Hidden Markov Modeling","sourcePdf":"56tsp01-sloin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095362S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4407637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4407637","articleId":"4374155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374180,"authors":[{"name":"Khoa D.

These in turn cause anomalies in the interdomain routing process. The policy-based nature of border gateway protocol (BGP) further aggravates the effect of these anomalies causing severe, long lasting route fluctuations. In this work we propose an architecture for anomaly detection that can be implemented on individual routers. We use statistical pattern recognition techniques for extracting meaningful features from the BGP update message data. A time-series segmentation algorithm is then carried out on the feature traces to detect the onset of an instability event The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using real Internet trace data. We show that instabilities triggered by events like router mis-configurations, infrastructure failures and worm attacks can be detected with a false alarm rate as low as 0.0083 alarms per hour. We also show that our learning based mechanism is highly robust as compared to methods like exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) based detection.","doi":"10.1109/BROADNETS.2006.4374397","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374295/4374296/04374397.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BROADNETS.2006.4374397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374296","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Approach to Anomaly Detection in Interdomain Routing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Approach to Anomaly Detection in Interdomain Routing","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374397/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9705368","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374397/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Approach to Anomaly Detection in Interdomain Routing","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"BROADNETS-00-101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083399S","chronDate":"1-5 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4374295","isNumber":"4374296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374295","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4374296","articleId":"4374397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4374412,"authors":[{"name":"Karthikeyan Sundaresan","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, USA"],"firstName":"Karthikeyan","lastName":"Sundaresan","id":"37274483000"},{"name":"Sriram Lakshmanan","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Lakshmanan","id":"37306634100"},{"name":"Raghupathy Sivakumar","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, USA"],"firstName":"Raghupathy","lastName":"Sivakumar","id":"37272145500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0424-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0425-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4374412","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":113},"abstract":"Smart antennas include a broad range of antenna technologies ranging from the simple switched beam to the more sophisticated adaptive arrays and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) links. Their ability to exploit multiple degrees of freedom helps them operate in different strategies to achieve different objectives ranging from rate increase, range increase, transmission power reduction, and higher link reliability. While these antennas have been significantly researched at the PHY layer leading to results that are easily translatable to single-hop wireless networks, very little is understood about their use in multi-hop wireless ad-hoc networks. Specific unanswered questions in this context include: (i) what kind of performance improvements can the different technologies and their strategies provide? (ii) for each technology, which of the different possible strategies is the optimal strategy to employ for a given network condition? and (iii) for a given network setting, which of the different smart antenna technologies will deliver the best performance? In this paper, we systematically answer these questions by comprehensively evaluating the relative benefits of the different smart antenna technologies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Adaptive arrays","MIMO","Antenna arrays","Ad hoc networks","Directional antennas","Paper technology","Physical layer","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","MIMO communication","radio links","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart antenna","multihop wireless network","switched beam antenna","adaptive antenna array","multiple input multiple output link","MIMO"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BROADNETS.2006.4374412","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd International Conference on Broadband Communications, Networks and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374295/4374296/04374412.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BROADNETS.2006.4374412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Use of Smart Antennas in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of Smart Antennas in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374412/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374412/","accessionNumber":"9697116","conferenceDate":"1-5 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Oct. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of Smart Antennas in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"BROADNETS-00-116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053435S","chronDate":"1-5 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4374295","isNumber":"4374296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374295","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4374296","articleId":"4374412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4374438,"authors":[{"name":"Saleh Faruque","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Saleh","lastName":"Faruque","id":"37344546200"},{"name":"David Kilpela","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Kilpela","id":"37947641900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0940-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0941-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"}],"articleNumber":"4374438","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Modulation coding","Field programmable gate arrays","Frequency shift keying","Decoding","Error correction","Block codes","Communication channels","Digital modulation","Demodulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","circuit simulation","error correction codes","field programmable gate arrays","forward error correction","hardware description languages","modulation coding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","bandwidth efficient coded modulation","parity block codes","field programmable gate array","forward error control coding","VHDL","MATLAB simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error Control Coding","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"A method of bandwidth efficient coded modulation and its implementation on FPGA is presented. The proposed coding technique parses the input data into two blocks corresponding to ODD parity block and EVEN parity block, calculates and appends the vertical parity from the columns, and transmits the coded blocks across the channel.

This paper exploits the cellular neural network (CNN) paradigm to develop a new edge detection algorithm.

Four benchmark video sequences are analyzed, that is, Car-phone, Miss America, Stefan, and Foreman. The analysis shows that the proposed algorithm yields accurate results, better than the ones achievable by other CNN-based methods. Finally, comparisons with standard edge detection techniques (i.e., LoG edge detector and Canny algorithm) further confirm the capability of the developed approach.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2007.4374439","startPage":"498","endPage":"502","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374431/4374432/04374439.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2007.4374439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for image processing: New edge detection algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Image processing","Image edge detection","Cellular neural networks","Hardware","Video sequences","Image sequence analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Standards development","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","edge detection","image sequences","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","edge detection algorithm","cellular neural network","image contours","video sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for image processing: New edge detection algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374439/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9821134","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for image processing: New edge detection algorithm","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242007-0007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069754S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374431","isNumber":"4374432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374431","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4374432","articleId":"4374439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4374460,"authors":[{"name":"Salih M.

Earlier efforts were hindered by the shortcomings of technology. Recent technological advancements have improved the likelihood of developing a practical intracortical visual prosthesis device that can be implanted in blind human subjects. The requirement of such a device is to operate in real-time for a high density of implanted electrodes, low power, light weight and flexibility to adapt to different stimului and image processing conditions. It has been known since the early twentieth century that electrical stimulation of visual cortex produces visual percepts called 'Phosphenes.' However, practical experimental setups are lacking that demonstrate the integration of phosphenes into an larger visual perception. We have developed an experimental setup to test the possibility of inducing large-scale visual perception in a non-human primate by stimulating implanted microelectrodes. This will help to raise the confidence in the intracortical approach before an actual human implantation is attempted. This paper discusses the hardware architecture and experiments developed for a preliminary visual prosthesis device to test visual perception.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based visual prosthesis device for testing visual perception on non human primates","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2007.4374463","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374431/4374432/04374463.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2007.4374463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based visual prosthesis device for testing visual perception on non human primates","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374463/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9807452","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based visual prosthesis device for testing visual perception on non human primates","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242007-0031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052043S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374431","isNumber":"4374432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374431","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4374432","articleId":"4374463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4374465,"authors":[{"name":"Naima Kaabouch","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Naima","lastName":"Kaabouch","id":"37586567500"},{"name":"Aparna Dhirde","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Aparna","lastName":"Dhirde","id":"37541470200"},{"name":"Saleh Faruque","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Saleh","lastName":"Faruque","id":"37344546200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0940-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0941-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"}],"articleNumber":"4374465","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Field programmable gate arrays","Error correction codes","Crosstalk","Error correction","Neodymium","Communication cables","Electromagnetic interference","Bandwidth","Cyclic redundancy check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","convolutional codes","crosstalk","electromagnetic interference","error correction codes","error detection codes","field programmable gate arrays","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal code convolution capabilities","FPGA implementation","EMI","crosstalk","error detection","error correction techniques","field programmable gate arrays","bandwidth efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FECC","FPGA","Orthogonal Code Convolution"]}],"abstract":"When data is stored, compressed, or communicated through a media such as cable or air, sources of noise and other parameters such as EMI, crosstalk, and distance can considerably affect the reliability of these data. Error detection and correction techniques are therefore required. Orthogonal Code is one of the codes that can detect errors and correct corrupted data. An n-bit orthogonal code has n/2 is and n/2 0s. In a previous work these properties have been exploited to detect and correct errors. In this paper we present a new methodology to enhance error detection capabilities of the orthogonal code. The technique was implemented experimentally using field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

Based on the pre-layout simulation results, the core area of the developed MBFFT is 2.04 mm with the maximal work frequency of 198 MHz for N=8192 points (24 bits per word).","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2007.4374475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2007.4374475","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374431/4374432/04374475.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient memory-based FFT processors for OFDM applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient memory-based FFT processors for OFDM applications","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9821141","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374475/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient memory-based FFT processors for OFDM applications","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242007-0043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071148S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374431","isNumber":"4374432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374431","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4374432","articleId":"4374475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4374486,"authors":[{"name":"Imad Zyout","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Imad","lastName":"Zyout","id":"38278146100"},{"name":"Ikhlas Abdel-Qader","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ikhlas","lastName":"Abdel-Qader","id":"38273767200"},{"name":"Hazem Al-Otum","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Hazem","lastName":"Al-Otum","id":"38274757300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0940-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0941-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"}],"articleNumber":"4374486","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image coding","Image reconstruction","Wavelet domain","Breast cancer","Tomography","Partitioning algorithms","Bit rate","Compression algorithms","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","decoding","image coding","image reconstruction","mammography","medical image processing","set theory","trees (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mammograms","integer wavelet transforms","region of interest image coding","set partitioning","hierarchical tree scheme","reversible wavelet transform","reconstruction features","image compression","decoding process","PACS network","MIAS database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Region of Interest Image Coding","SPIHT","Lifting Scheme","Integer Wavelets"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate embedded region of interest (ROI) image coding of mammograms. This coding algorithm is based on combining set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) scheme and reversible wavelet transform. We show that this combination produces both progressive and perfect reconstruction features. The benefit of such approach is that it offers the possibility of compressing ROI with high fidelity up to lossless and at early stages of the decoding process. This allows receiving ROI data with high fidelity at low bit rates while transmitting over PACS network. The results show that proper selection of reversible wavelet transforms is a significant element in ROI image coding.

The design and implementation framework proposed in our paper is based on a non-subsampled tree structure, which allows for redundancy capturing some image characteristics for detection. We examine structures for analysis using 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</sup>\n filters, M > 3, with narrow wedge-shaped passbands. Our structures are derived from the decimation of two-dimensional impulse responses composed of configurations of one-dimensional building blocks. In the implementation, we reconfigure transfer functions of the filters with decimated impulse responses by exploiting appropriate polyphase structure of one-dimensional building blocks to retain the property of generalized separability along directions determined by the passband orientations of the directional filters. The reconfiguration depends on the value of M, and in this paper we provide general rules for choosing the integer factors for polyphase decomposition that help re-cast the expressions for the transfer functions of the analysis bank of filters into forms that allow efficient implementation. The proposed implementation is shown to provide significant improvement compared with conventional two-dimensional implementation. Simulations show that the filtering structure provides good frequency selectivity on airborne surveillance images.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2007.4374534","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374431/4374432/04374534.pdf","startPage":"422","endPage":"427","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2007.4374534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity implementation of non-subsampled directional filter banks using polyphase representations and generalized separable processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity implementation of non-subsampled directional filter banks using polyphase representations and generalized separable processing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374534/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9832365","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374534/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity implementation of non-subsampled directional filter banks using polyphase representations and generalized separable processing","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242007-0102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04765S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374431","isNumber":"4374432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374431","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4374432","articleId":"4374534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374538,"authors":[{"name":"Malihe Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"lastName":"Malihe Ahmadi","id":"37692784600"},{"name":"Aryan Saadat Mehr","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"lastName":"Aryan Saadat Mehr","id":"37326842700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0940-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0941-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"}],"articleNumber":"4374538","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Bandwidth","Demodulation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Fourier transforms","Channel estimation","Baseband","Testing","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superimposed training aided carrier frequency offset estimation","OFDM systems","DFT demodulation","frequency selective slowly-varying channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset(CFO)","superimosed training sequence","Cyclic prefix (CP)","Channel impulse response (CIR)"]}],"abstract":"In OFDM systems, orthogonality between subcarriers is impaired due to carrier frequency offset (CFO) and it must be compensated for in the receiver before DFT demodulation.

This paper investigates the performance analysis and simulation of a MC-CDMA systems with several spreading codes operating over a doubly selective channel. The time selectivity is modelled by the Doppler spread. The Doppler spread is the difference in Doppler frequencies between different channel paths. The performances are presented in term of bit error rate (BER) as a function of the Doppler frequency for several values of signal to noise ratio (SNR) and for different number of users.

Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller even in the presence of motor parameter variations and unknown load disturbance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374585/","accessionNumber":"9649823","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Indirect Adaptive Fuzzy Control of Induction Motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Indirect Adaptive Fuzzy Control of Induction Motors","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045537S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4374607,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Kazemy","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Kazemy","id":"37546512400"},{"name":"Seyed Amin Hosseini","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Amin","lastName":"Hosseini","id":"38182866200"},{"name":"Mohammad Farrokhi","affiliation":["Center for Excellence for Power System Automation and Operation, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Farrokhi","id":"37299120500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4374607","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","Neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Convergence","Control systems","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear systems","Fuzzy control","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","nonlinear control systems","recurrent neural nets","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second order diagonal recurrent neural network","recurrent weights","hidden neuron layer","nonlinear function approximation","convergence stability","adaptive learning rate","model identification","image stabilization platform","realtime control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374607","abstract":"In this paper a new diagonal recurrent neural network that contains two recurrent weights in hidden layer is proposed. Since diagonal recurrent neural networks have simpler structure than the fully connected recurrent neural networks, they are easier to use in real-time applications. On the other hand, all diagonal recurrent neural networks in literature use one recurrent weight in hidden neurons, while the proposed network takes advantage of two recurrent weights. It will be shown, by simulations, that the proposed network can approximate nonlinear functions better than the existing diagonal recurrent neural networks. After deriving the training algorithm, the convergence stability and adaptive learning rate will be presented. The performance of the proposed network in model identification shows the accuracy of this network against the diagonal recurrent neural networks. Moreover, this network will be applied to realtime control of an image stabilization platform.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374607","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374607.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"256","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second Order Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Second Order Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9649814","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374607/","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second Order Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077361S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4374609,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Reza Pourshaghaghi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Pourshaghaghi","id":"37399659300"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Jaheh-Motlagh","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Jaheh-Motlagh","id":"37085972493"},{"name":"Ali-Akbar Jalali","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali-Akbar","lastName":"Jalali","id":"37300412300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4374609","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":345},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback control","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Regulators","Control systems","Optimization methods","Paper technology","Design optimization","Power system stability","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","genetic algorithms","nonlinear systems","optimal control","pendulums","stability","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal feedback control design","genetic algorithm","inverted pendulum","linear quadratic regulator optimization process","trial-and-error method","Bryson method","time varying feedback control","stability","benchmark control problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374609","abstract":"This paper introduces an application of genetic algorithm (GA) to determine weighting matrices Q and R elements in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimization process.

Commonly, a trial-and-error method has been used to construct the elements of these matrices. This method is simple, but very difficult to choose the best values that have good control performances. Because of this, the Bryson method can be employed to give better results. In this paper, we use GA to construct the weighting matrices Q and R properly with help of Bryson method.

It suggests using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to identify motion commands for the control of a prosthetic hand. In this work a hybrid method for training fuzzy system, consisting of back-propagation (BP) and least mean square (LMS) is utilized. Also in order to optimize the number of fuzzy rules, a subtractive clustering algorithm has been developed. The myoelectric signals utilized to classify, were six hand movements. Features chosen for SEMG signal were time and time-frequency domain. Neuro-fuzzy systems designed and utilized in this study were tested independently and in a combined manner for both time and time-frequency features. The results showed that the combined feature implementation was the best in regard to identification of required movement tasks.

However, its presence, in turn, often results in degradation of dynamic performance and instability of the system even if the filter attenuation is brilliantly designed. The detrimental interaction between an input filter and a switched mode converter is a function of the input filter parameters as well as the supply voltage. This paper addresses the instability problem in dc-dc converters under strong influence of input filter interaction and suggests a systematic design procedure to damp the input filter using R-C parallel damping in order to stabilize the whole filter- converter system without over sizing or under sizing. It is then possible to define a dc-dc converter's stable operating region based on the input filter's damping circuit parameters. A buck converter under voltage-mode control is used as an illustrative example. Computer simulations and experimental results validate theoretical results of this paper.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374623","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374623.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Input Filter Damping Design for Control Loop Stability of DC-DC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Input Filter Damping Design for Control Loop Stability of DC-DC Converters","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374623/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9649807","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input Filter Damping Design for Control Loop Stability of DC-DC Converters","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060439S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4374634,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

Due to their ability to reverse the direction of flow of power, they are being increasingly used in many applications such as battery charger/dischargers, dc uninterruptible power supplies, electrical vehicle motor drives, aerospace power systems, telecom power supplies, etc. This paper proposes a new bidirectional Sepic/Zeta converter. It has low switching loss and low conduction loss due to auxiliary communicated circuit and synchronous rectifier operation, respectively. Because of positive and buck/boost-like DC voltage transfer function (M=D/1-D), the proposed converter is desirable for use in distributed power system. The proposed converter also has both transformer-less version and transformer one.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374656","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374656.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"560","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Bidirectional ZVS PWM Sepic/Zeta DC-DC Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"New Bidirectional ZVS PWM Sepic/Zeta DC-DC Converter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374656/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9678391","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374656/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Bidirectional ZVS PWM Sepic/Zeta DC-DC Converter","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110571S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4374659,"authors":[{"name":"Nasrudin Abd Rahim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Nasrudin Abd","lastName":"Rahim","id":"37278319700"},{"name":"Jeyraj Selvaraj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Jeyraj","lastName":"Selvaraj","id":"37402874600"},{"name":"Krismadinata","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Krismadinata","id":"37402873800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4374659","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1607},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374659","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Current control","Photovoltaic systems","Sensorless control","Inverters","Control systems","DC-DC power converters","Solar power generation","Voltage control","Robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","electric current control","hysteresis","invertors","photovoltaic power systems","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current regulation","regulated DC bus voltage","sensorless maximum power point tracker algorithm","full bridge inverter","DC-DC boost converter","photovoltaic application","single phase transformerless grid connected inverter system","grid connected photovoltaic systems","sensorless MPPT","hysteresis current control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374659","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374659.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hysteresis Current Control and Sensorless MPPT for Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems","abstract":"This paper describes a control method for single-phase transformerless grid-connected inverter system for photovoltaic (PV) application.

This modulation technique is able to completely eliminate low- frequency voltage oscillations in the neutral point. However, its dynamic for balancing voltages on the dc-link capacitors is slow. The proposed compensator generates an optimal offset for the modulation signals that improves significantly the voltage balancing issue for any operation condition of the converter. Furthermore, this strategy does not increase switching frequencies of the devices. The algorithm is tested and verified by simulation and experiment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374685","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374685.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"724","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Voltage-Balancing Compensator in the Modulation of a Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Voltage-Balancing Compensator in the Modulation of a Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374685/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9642723","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374685/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Voltage-Balancing Compensator in the Modulation of a Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05101S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4374688,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo Perez","affiliation":["Electronics Department Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico, Valpara\u00edso, CHILE"],"firstName":"Marcelo","lastName":"Perez","id":"37286998700"},{"name":"Jose Rodriguez","affiliation":["Electronics Department Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico, Valpara\u00edso, CHILE"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37279149900"},{"name":"Jorge Pontt","affiliation":["Electronics Department Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico, Valpara\u00edso, CHILE"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Pontt","id":"37279147100"},{"name":"Samir Kouro","affiliation":["Electronics Department Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico, Valpara\u00edso, CHILE"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Kouro","id":"37270051000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4374688","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1571},"abstract":"Hybrid multi-cell converters present a highly nonlinear power distribution at each cell. Moreover, the cells with smaller DC link voltage can regenerate power, even if the load is not active. This paper shows the active power distribution in terms of the modulation index, highlighting the regenerative operation. The active power is calculated based on the fundamental term of the switching pattern obtained by the nearest level or round modulation. The round modulation technique is described as a comparison algorithm to allow a mathematical analysis. This paper shows that low power cells present a regenerative operation which depends on the modulation technique and does not depend of the load type. The modulation index rates of regenerative operation are found, as example, for a three-cell hybrid multi- cell converter for two different asymmetries.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374688.pdf","startPage":"736","endPage":"741","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Distribution in Hybrid Multi-cell Converter with Nearest Level Modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power distribution","Voltage","Pulse width modulation","Topology","DC generators","Mathematical analysis","Hybrid power systems","Pulse width modulation inverters","Rectifiers","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation","power convertors","power distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["round modulation","regenerative operation","modulation index","active power distribution","DC link voltage","nearest level modulation","hybrid multicell converter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Power Distribution in Hybrid Multi-cell Converter with Nearest Level Modulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374688/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9649928","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Distribution in Hybrid Multi-cell Converter with Nearest Level Modulation","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136111S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374700,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Frequency values up to the MHz range and current levels as high as several tenths of amperes can be needed to get the required information to describe the operation in real-working conditions. While small-signal impedance measurements are easily achieved up to 1 MHz and above with commercial LCR meters, no commercial equipment provides the complete solution for the power, frequency and load quality factor ranges required under large-signal operation so a custom- made measurement testbench must be designed. The testbench design comprises the development of a specific hardware for load excitation and the definition of the characterization procedures to obtain accurate impedance measurements which are described in this paper using a high performance digital oscilloscope and standard power electronics probes.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374700","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374700.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","startPage":"805","endPage":"810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methods and procedures for accurate induction heating load measurement and characterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Methods and procedures for accurate induction heating load measurement and characterization","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374700/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9649923","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374700/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methods and procedures for accurate induction heating load measurement and characterization","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059422S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374721,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil Abdelli","affiliation":["THALES Communications, Colombes Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Abdelli","id":"37564785400"},{"name":"A-M Fouilliart","affiliation":["THALES Communications, Colombes Cedex, France"],"firstName":"A-M","lastName":"Fouilliart","id":"37564788700"},{"name":"Nathalie Julien","affiliation":["CNRS FRE2734, UBS University, Lorient Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Julien","id":"37273363800"},{"name":"Eric Senn","affiliation":["CNRS FRE2734, UBS University, Lorient Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Senn","id":"37273364700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4374721","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":312},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Energy consumption","Embedded system","Process design","Power system modeling","Signal processing algorithms","Embedded software","Hardware design languages","Application specific integrated circuits","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level power estimation","FPGA","embedded system design","reconfigurable devices","field-programmable gate arrays","classical signal-processing algorithm"]}],"abstract":"With the success of battery-based personal computing devices and wireless communication systems, low power has become a key issue in embedded system design. As a result, designers are now encouraged to consider the impact of their decisions not only on speed and area performances, but also on power consumption throughout the entire design process. This paper presents our contribution in terms of power estimation and exploration methodology based on high-level power modeling approach of re-configurable devices such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). In order to address the different abstraction levels and the various targets, a global methodology is proposed here to elaborate suitable models. With our high-level power model, the FPGA power estimation can be obtained at early stage of the design process. Experimental results indicate on a classical signal-processing algorithm; that the gap between measures and estimations is lower than 18%. From these models, several consumption optimizations can be deducted from the sensitivity metric.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374721","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374721.pdf","startPage":"925","endPage":"930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Level Power Estimation of FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374721/","displayDocTitle":"High-Level Power Estimation of FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374721/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9704935","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Level Power Estimation of FPGA","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04817S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4374721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374724,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Henrique da Silva","affiliation":["Federal University of Itajuba, Itajuba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Carlos Henrique","lastName":"da Silva","id":"37675188300"},{"name":"Valberto Ferreira da Silva","affiliation":["Federal University of Itajuba, Itajuba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Valberto Ferreira","lastName":"da Silva","id":"37270018200"},{"name":"Luiz Eduardo Borges da Silva","affiliation":["Federal University of Itajuba - Itajuba, Brazil."],"firstName":"Luiz Eduardo Borges","lastName":"da Silva","id":"38182371400"},{"name":"Germano Lambert-Torres","affiliation":["Federal University of Itajuba, Itajuba, Brazil"],"firstName":"Germano","lastName":"Lambert-Torres","id":"38182345500"},{"name":"Edson Hideki Takauti","affiliation":["Bandeirante Power Company - Energias do Brasil -S\u00e3o Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Edson Hideki","lastName":"Takauti","id":"38352105600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4374724","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Power harmonic filters","Power system harmonics","Wire","Control systems","Impedance","Harmonic distortion","Error correction","Phase detection","Power distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","distribution networks","harmonic distortion","power harmonic filters","power system harmonics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["series active power filter","series active impedance","neutral wire","synchronous reference frame controller","zero sequence harmonic components","unbalanced three-phase four-wire systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Serie active filter","Modified synchronous reference frame controller","power distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374724","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374724","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","abstract":"This paper discusses the limitations of the series active power filter operating in unbalanced three-phase four-wire systems and proposes the insertion of series active impedance to neutral wire.

Then, these methods will be analyzed and compared by simulation, concluding that despite the fact that they achieve very similar results, the method that minimizes the power ripples by an approximation, is more suitable to be implemented in a real time application, since it presents very good results and is the less computationally expensive.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374755","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374755.pdf","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Direct Power Control of the Doubly Fed Induction Machine with Reduced Power Ripple at Low Constant Switching Frequency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374755/","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Direct Power Control of the Doubly Fed Induction Machine with Reduced Power Ripple at Low Constant Switching Frequency","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9642632","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374755/","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Direct Power Control of the Doubly Fed Induction Machine with Reduced Power Ripple at Low Constant Switching Frequency","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054176S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4374779,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Xiu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xiu","id":"37839297000"},{"name":"Chang-Liang Xia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Chang-Liang","lastName":"Xia","id":"37333756800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4374779","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Neural networks","Switches","Robustness","Couplings","Rotors","Nonlinear equations","Takagi-Sugeno model","Fuzzy logic","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machine analysis computing","fuzzy logic","inference mechanisms","neural nets","reluctance motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched reluctance motor","pi-sigma neural network","nonlinear function","rotor position","nonlinear mapping","Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy logic inference","current wave"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374779","abstract":"Flux linkage of switch reluctance motor is in nonlinear function of both rotor position and phase current.

This paper makes a brief description about some matrix multiplication proposals when working in FPGAs (field programmable gate array). Thanks to their low prices and low costs, currently these devices are used in many and different applications. There are some alternative methods that optimize execution time to carry out this operation under FPGAs. The internal structure of these devices allows parallel execution of matrix multiplication. However, a systolic structure needs many internal resources such as embedded multipliers and often it cannot be used because of the low number of embedded multipliers in the used device. This structure is commonly used in FPGAs for small size matrices. However our proposed alternatives allow an efficient multiplication of matrices of sizes as big as 512 times 512 elements. The study done in this work compares the delay and area consumed of different matrix multiplication algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374862.pdf","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1714","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Different Proposals to Matrix Multiplication Based on FPGAS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Field programmable gate arrays","Partitioning algorithms","Image processing","Signal processing","Costs","Optimization methods","Delay","Availability","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","matrix multiplication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix multiplication","field programmable gate arrays","parallel execution","systolic structure","embedded multipliers","execution time optimisation","small size matrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Different Proposals to Matrix Multiplication Based on FPGAS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374862/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9642665","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Different Proposals to Matrix Multiplication Based on FPGAS","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054668S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4374867,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiro Hoshino","affiliation":["Imaging System Development Section, Sony Corporation, Shinagawa, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Hoshino","id":"37288890000"},{"name":"Hirofumi Sumi","affiliation":["Imaging System Development Section, Sony Corporation, Shinagawa, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Sumi","id":"37275548900"},{"name":"Toshihiro Nishimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiro","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37287475800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4374867","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"abstract":"The present paper describes noise detection and reduction for an imaging system by a method of autocorrelation of pixel data change as a function of time.

Distortion is mainly due to the nonlinear behavior of the output stage of the emitter's power amplifier, in the form of saturation or memory effects. In order for these effects to be mitigated, a correction can be applied to the input signals, causing them a distortion contrary to that occurring in the amplifier. Several analog and digital predistortion techniques have been proposed in the literature. This paper presents a new digital predistortion method which allows the requirements of DVB-T gap fillers in single frequency networks (SFN) to be accomplished while reducing processing time and complexity with regard to previous solutions. Experimental results are presented which support the claimed contributions of the method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374875","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374875.pdf","startPage":"1779","endPage":"1784","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Intermodulation Effects in Power Amplifiers through Segmented Predistortion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Intermodulation Effects in Power Amplifiers through Segmented Predistortion","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374875/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9689128","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374875/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Intermodulation Effects in Power Amplifiers through Segmented Predistortion","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046128S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4374879,"authors":[{"name":"Dana Skinner","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida A&M University-Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Dana","lastName":"Skinner","id":"37885689900"},{"name":"Simon Y.

Based on this information, the network will relocate their resources in order to achieve the performance specifications. Hence this objective motivates this paper, where analytical evaluations of the signal-to-noise plus interference ratio (SNIR) are carried out for each active user in a wireless communication system. In particular, this work studies the performance of linear detectors for direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems at different loading levels using singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques in the uplink channel. The QoS in terms of the SNIR are compared for the matched filter (MF), decorrelator, projector and minimum-mean-squared error (MMSE) detectors. In the analytical evaluations, two techniques are proposed to quantify the SNIR according to the multiple-access interference (MAI) and noise representation. The first one is based on an average of the MAI and noise information of all mobile users at the base station. The second approach relies on computing explicitly the interference for each active user. Simulation results show a performance comparison between both approaches, and a Monte-Carlo numerical evaluation in terms of the SNIR and the number of active users.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Detectors","Wireless networks","Multiple access interference","Multiaccess communication","Signal analysis","Wireless communication","Singular value decomposition","Matched filters","Decorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference (signal)","Monte Carlo methods","noise","quality of service","radio links","radio networks","resource allocation","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service analysis","linear multiuser detectors","wireless network uplink","resource relocation","performance specifications","signal-to-noise plus interference ratio","wireless communication system","direct-sequence code division multiple access systems","singular value decomposition","multiple-access interference","noise representation","base station","Monte-Carlo numerical evaluation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374905","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374905.pdf","startPage":"1945","endPage":"1950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality-of-Service Analysis for Linear Multiuser Detectors in the Uplink of a Wireless Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quality-of-Service Analysis for Linear Multiuser Detectors in the Uplink of a Wireless Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374905/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374905/","accessionNumber":"9695886","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality-of-Service Analysis for Linear Multiuser Detectors in the Uplink of a Wireless Network","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080178S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4374906,"authors":[{"name":"Jose L.

The proposed localization system makes use of the fingerprinting technique and employs CIR information as the signature and an artificial neural network as the pattern matching algorithm. For the considered indoor environment, the obtained CIR information can not be applied directly to the input of the ANN due to the high number of the CIR samples since an ANN with a high number of inputs requires a high number of learning patterns during its training. Consequently, relevant features reflecting the CIR signature have to be extracted and then applied to the ANN. The relevant features may be some physical channel parameters or a compressed version of the CIR signature. In this paper, the extraction of the CIR features is done using a wavelet-based compression. The particularity of the method is in the representation of the CIR signature in a judicious way facilitating the design of the ANN. Moreover, when the extracted features correspond to the CIR signature, the localization system tends to give mobile location with a high precision. Simulation of measured CIR in an indoor environment, showed a precision of 2 meters for 91% and 70% of trained and untrained data, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374919","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374919.pdf","startPage":"2028","endPage":"2032","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indoor Fingerprinting Geolocation using Wavelet-Based Features Extracted from the Channel Impulse Response in Conjunction with an Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Indoor Fingerprinting Geolocation using Wavelet-Based Features Extracted from the Channel Impulse Response in Conjunction with an Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9678378","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374919/","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indoor Fingerprinting Geolocation using Wavelet-Based Features Extracted from the Channel Impulse Response in Conjunction with an Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057948S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4374936,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenwen Su","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhenwen","lastName":"Su","id":"37686422300"},{"name":"Bi Zeng","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bi","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37552358000"},{"name":"Guangchang Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Guangchang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37966460000"},{"name":"Feng Ye","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Ye","id":"37088381234"},{"name":"Minglin Xu","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Minglin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37954784900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4374936","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Mobile robots","Path planning","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy logic","Navigation","Computer networks","Artificial neural networks","Robot sensing systems","Intelligent robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","mobile robots","motion control","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural network","parameter optimization","mobile robot","path planning","artificial potential field","fuzzy logic","real-time obstacle recognition","smooth motion","dynamic environment","obstacle avoidance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile Robot","Artificial Potential Field","Fuzzy Neural Network","Navigation","Avoiding Obstacle"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374936","abstract":"This paper discussed a new mobile robot path planning algorithm.

Automatic commissioning process is necessary for easy implementation and for acceptance of the carrier signal injection-based sensorless control by drives industry. In comparison with classical compensation methods, such as lookup tables, this technique has advantages of reducing commissioning time and automating the process. These advantages are result of a physics-based design of structured neural networks, which is responsible for their scalability, and moderate size and complexity.

This application is used to illustrate the high level of abstraction in the Handel-C language for describing FPGA functionality.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374967","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","startPage":"2313","endPage":"2318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Frequency Output and Input Using Handel-C","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Frequency Output and Input Using Handel-C","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374967/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4374967/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of Frequency Output and Input Using Handel-C","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05187S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4374969,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The primary- and secondary-side switches of the forward converter are driven by dedicated ASIC units. In detail, regulation of the main-switch duty-cycle is achieved by a primary IC implementing feed-forward control, while the outputs of the converter are locally regulated by two ASICs independently from the primary-switch duty-cycle. Since no communication is required during normal mode, the duty-cycle is defined by the the primary IC which controls the main switch is such a way that the primary duty-cycle is larger than the secondary one. Only during stand-by mode, communication between the primary controller and the secondary ones is required to increase the efficiency up to 50%. An opto-coupler device informs the primary side of the converter about the situation occurring at secondary side. Accordingly, the optocoupler communicates to the primary control ASIC the required duty-cycle, or that the primary switch has to be turned off at the occurrence of a failure at secondary side. The low-power mode efficiency is at least 50% at 500 mW load to meet the 1W stand-by requirement, and increases substantially at higher load. Experimental results carried out on a 300W demoboard are reported in this paper.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Switches","Switching converters","Application specific integrated circuits","Communication system control","Bidirectional control","Power supplies","Emergency power supplies","Inductance","Communication switching"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374969","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374969.pdf","startPage":"2326","endPage":"2331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Active Clamp Forward Converters by Independent Primary and Secondary ASICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of Active Clamp Forward Converters by Independent Primary and Secondary ASICs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374969/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374969/","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Active Clamp Forward Converters by Independent Primary and Secondary ASICs","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046756S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4374970,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The series active filter is a Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR), that operates in two functioning modes. During the unbalanced voltage sag/swell at the input side, the DVR maintains the rated voltage at the load side. It regulates the load voltage with minimum VA loading of the overall UPQC by an optimum voltage angle injection. A technique of achieving both input current distortion compensation, power factor correction and also mitigating the supply-voltage variation (sag/swell) at the load side, is presented as well. To reduce the total cost, but to increase the performance, the system is fully digital-controlled using the fixed-point TMS320F240 digital signal processor. The present paper discusses the VA requirement issues of the proposed UPQC. The performances of the optimum UPQC have been verified on an experimental prototype.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374990","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04374990.pdf","startPage":"2443","endPage":"2448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4374990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Phase Unified Power Quality Conditioner with Optimum Voltage Angle Injection for Minimum VA requirement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4374990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4374990/","displayDocTitle":"Single-Phase Unified Power Quality Conditioner with Optimum Voltage Angle Injection for Minimum VA requirement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4374990/","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Phase Unified Power Quality Conditioner with Optimum Voltage Angle Injection for Minimum VA requirement","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057294S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4374990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4375024,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed G.

During the learning process, the hidden units are increased or decreased according to an adaptive algorithm. The WNN is finally built with a much simpler and more compact structure. Through a gradient descent error algorithm, the WNN is trained both off-line and on-line. In the off-line training, the parameters of network are initialized and the number of hidden units is obtained. While on-line training, the weights of WNN are updated based on the output signals after filter. By mapping the phase voltages to commutating signals, the network can replace the traditional position sensors.

Simulation results show that the proposed approach is in good harmony with the real characteristics of the SFCLs.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4375066","startPage":"2859","endPage":"2863","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4375066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04375066.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Superconductive Fault Current Limiter Using Constructive Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375066/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling Superconductive Fault Current Limiter Using Constructive Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4375066/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9642692","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Superconductive Fault Current Limiter Using Constructive Neural Networks","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07027S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4375066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4375067,"authors":[{"name":"Claudionor F.

Simulation requires the modelling of the principal element (the Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell) in dynamic mode. The model used is that described by J.

The methodology used in this study consists in the simulation of a large number of parameters in a material under test, using the FEM. Both variations in relative magnetic permeability and electrical conductivity of the material under test are considered. Then, the obtained results are used to generate a set of vectors for the training of RBF neural network. Finally, the obtained neural network (NN) is used to evaluate a group of new materials, simulated by the FEM, but not belonging to the original dataset. Performance of the RBF network was also compared with the most commonly used multilayer perceptron (MLP) network model.

This paper proposes an adaptive multiple sampling rate scheduling (AMSRS) methodology with digital filters in the signal process steps of the control loop to maintain the transmitted measurement signals' fidelity in order to help supervisor's decision making under normal and faulty operating conditions. Specifications of digital filters are chosen according to the system's frequency domain characteristics to bound the signal sampling and reconstruction errors as well as conserve available resource. A networked high throughput screening (HTS) process supervisory control system is used as a case study in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of using digital filters in the sampling rate scheduling method. A comparison between using the digital filter and previous zero-order hold approach (Z. Li and M.-Y. Chow, 2006) in signal reconstruction shows that digital filters can further reduce the reconstruction error. Furthermore, the use of filters extensively reduces the amount of consuming bandwidth (resource) in signal sampling and transmission (e.g., 40% and 56% bandwidth saved by two types of digital filters in specific case), and improves the system performance bounded by the limited resources.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4375073","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04375073.pdf","startPage":"2893","endPage":"2898","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4375073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Rate Scheduling and Digital Filter Co-design of Networked Supervisory Control System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Rate Scheduling and Digital Filter Co-design of Networked Supervisory Control System","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4375073/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9642695","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375073/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Rate Scheduling and Digital Filter Co-design of Networked Supervisory Control System","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051907S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4375073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4375074,"authors":[{"name":"Volodymyr Vasyutynskyy","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Vasyutynskyy","id":"37541099500"},{"name":"Klaus Kabitzsch","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Kabitzsch","id":"38532305300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4375074","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":140},"abstract":"The deadband sampling can be used in networked control systems to reduce the number of triggered events.

This tool consists of an integrated web-access set of multimedia animation-clips which present, in an interactive way, how the different dc choppers topologies work. The different topologies are classified depending on their quadrant operation and then the user can realize the circuit's performance from the simplest class-A to the four quadrant operation class-E converter. To do this, all circuit parameters including load values, duty ratio, and frequency may be selected by the user. Moreover, the load includes an electromotive force (EMF) that allows understanding the energy flow between the source and the load and then, the quadrant operation. Other useful characteristic of the tool is the way in which the circuits are drawn because they can be shown as a bridge or in their simplest form in the case of only the essentials devices being shown.

The first stage is used for power factor correction, the second stage is used to stabilize the discharge and the last stage is used to turn the DC output of the previous stage to a low frequency AC square waveform suitable to supply the lamp. The dynamic impedance of the lamp does not allow using the power factor correction stage to stabilize the discharge. This is due to the fact that voltage in the bulk capacitor can not be changed fast enough to stabilize the lamp current. In this paper, a boost-type post-regulator working at the zero-duty-cycle limit is proposed to stabilize the discharge. This way, a non-linear post-regulator with very high efficiency is obtained. A simplified procedure to design the regulator is also presented in this paper. A laboratory prototype has been built to verify the proposed procedure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lamps","Power factor

An endoscopic surgery is one of the minimally invasive surgeries. With the endoscopic surgery, pain could be less. This operation, however, has difficulty, and surgeons have to be well trained. To solve this problem, an endoscopic surgery system based on haptic teleoperation was proposed. The characteristic of the system is position and force information is transmitted bilaterally between master and slave robots. This means that a teleoperation with haptic information can be achieved, and surgeons can perform a telesurgery safely and smoothly. The system, however, does not have enough degrees of freedom for an actual operation. In this paper, a multi degrees of freedom endoscopic robotic system is proposed. This system has 6 degrees of freedom on each master and slave robot. A haptic control system implemented in the proposed system is based on acceleration control. Due to control in acceleration dimension, robust and ideal position and force control are able to be attained simultaneously. The control system requires a short sampling period for attainment of wide bandwidth to transmit keen force sensation. To ensure the short sampling period in a multi degrees of freedom system, this paper proposes the multi degrees of freedom tele-robotic system utilizing FPGA as a controller. Finally the validity of the proposed system is shown by experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4375108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4375108","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04375108.pdf","startPage":"3084","endPage":"3089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Bilateral Control in Multi DOF Haptic Surgical Robotic System Utilizing FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9678408","htmlLink":"/document/4375108/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilateral Control in Multi DOF Haptic Surgical Robotic System Utilizing FPGA","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064288S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4375108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4375124,"authors":[{"name":"Salvador Ceballos","affiliation":["ROBOTIKER, Energy Unit, Tecnalia, Technological Corporation, Basque, Spain"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"Ceballos","id":"37293931400"},{"name":"Josep Pou","affiliation":["Terrassa Industrial Electronics Group (TIEG), Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Pou","id":"37274427400"},{"name":"Eider Robles","affiliation":["ROBOTIKER, Energy Unit, Tecnalia, Technological Corporation, Basque, Spain"],"firstName":"Eider","lastName":"Robles","id":"37294042000"},{"name":"Jordi Zaragoza","affiliation":["Terrassa Industrial Electronics Group (TIEG), Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Zaragoza","id":"37294161600"},{"name":"Jose Luis Martin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication, University of Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Basque, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Luis","lastName":"Martin","id":"37290464600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0754-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0755-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5137"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5145"}],"articleNumber":"4375124","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"abstract":"This paper presents a study of the fault tolerance capacity of a neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converter.

As a result, the modulation strategy of the three main legs of the converter does not have to take care of voltage balance, and it can be design to improve the efficiency of the converter. On the other hand, the addition of a fourth leg to the converter produces additional losses. However, in order to eliminate switching losses of this leg, all the power devices commutate under zero-current or zero-voltage transitions. Some simulation results are presented to show viability of this approach under both, normal operation mode and fault event.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4375125/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9642734","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Soft-Switching Topology for a Fault-Tolerant Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-Switching Topology for a Fault-Tolerant Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070415S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4375125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4375144,"authors":[{"name":"Bodgan M.

This temporal coding spiking neural network model employs a Hebbian-based rule to shift the connection delays instead of the previous approaches of delay selection. Here the tuned delays compensate the differences in the input firing times of temporal patterns and enables them to coincide. The coincidence detection capability of the spiking neuron has been utilised for pattern detection. The structure of the network is similar to that of a Kohonen's self-organising map (SOM) except that the output layer neurons are coincidence detecting spiking neurons. An input pattern is represented by the neuron that is the first to fire among all the competing spiking neurons. Clusters within the input data are identified with the location of the winning neurons and their firing times. The proposed spiking neural network has been utilised to cluster SPC control chart patterns. The trained network obtained an average clustering accuracy of 96.1% on previously unseen test data. This was achieved with a network of 8times8 spiking neurons trained for 20 epochs containing 1000 training examples. The clustering accuracy of the proposed model was found to be better than that of Kohonen's SOM.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2007.4375170","startPage":"3441","endPage":"3446","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2007.4375170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4374555","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4374554/4374555/04375170.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-organising spiking neural network trained using delay adaptation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375170/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A self-organising spiking neural network trained using delay adaptation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4375170/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9649891","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"4-7 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-organising spiking neural network trained using delay adaptation","confLoc":"Vigo, Spain","sourcePdf":"ISIE-00-615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055865S","chronDate":"4-7 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4374554","isNumber":"4374555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4374554","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4374555","articleId":"4375170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4375197,"authors":[{"name":"Saleh Al-Jazzar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hashemite University, Zerka, Jordan"],"firstName":"Saleh","lastName":"Al-Jazzar","id":"38346425300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-9957-486-00-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4375197","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"abstract":"In this paper, we present analysis and equalization for asynchronous received signals in a code-division- multiple-access (CDMA) system.

The results are presented either in an integral form or in the form of hyper-geometric infinite series. Unfortunately its use leads to numerical un-stability.

When the fading channel is approximated by an autoregressive (AR) process, it can be estimated by means of Kalman filtering for instance. Nevertheless, this requires the a priori estimation of the AR parameters. One standard solution consists in first fitting the AR process autocorrelation function to the Jakes one and then solving the resulting Yule-Walker equations (YWE). However, due to the band-limited nature of the Jakes Doppler spectrum, severely ill-conditioned YWE are unavoidable for all but very small AR model orders. Therefore, previous studies focused only on 1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">st</sup>\n and 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nd</sup>\n order AR models. To overcome the ill-conditioning problem, a very small positive bias can be added to the main diagonal of the autocorrelation matrix in the YWE. Even if the resulting process is not band-limited and corresponds to an AR process+noise model, the approximation can be of interest. Indeed, according to our simulation results, high-order AR models+noise yield significant results in terms of spectrum approximation and bit error rate (BER).

DS gives a measure of the frequency selectivity of the wireless channel, which can be used for channel estimation and to adjust the guard interval size to avoid Inter-Symbol Interference. The estimator is based on the frequency correlation between subcarriers of one OFDM symbol and an expression between frequency correlation and DS is derived assuming an exponentially decaying power delay profile (PDP). To derive the frequency correlation values we use frequency separation values different to zero, which to the best of authors' knowledge is the first time that is introduced. The estimation accuracy, examined in environments with different PDPs, including transceiver mobility and channel sparsity, using several constellation schemes is very high from low SNR values with small variance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Proceedings of the First Mobile Computing and Wireless Communication International Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4375173/4375174/04375214.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"159","publicationTitle":"2006 Proceedings of the First Mobile Computing and Wireless Communication International Conference","doi":"10.1109/MCWC.2006.4375214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCWC.2006.4375214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4375174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4375214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Blind Delay Spread Estimation using Frequency Correlation for Wireless OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay estimation","Frequency estimation","OFDM","Channel estimation","Interference","Bit rate","Noise measurement","Baseband","Frequency division multiplexing","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay estimation","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind delay spread estimation","frequency correlation","wireless OFDM systems","wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexed systems","frequency selectivity","wireless channel","inter-symbol interference","transceiver mobility","channel sparsity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Blind Delay Spread Estimation using Frequency Correlation for Wireless OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4375214/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9696433","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"17-20 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Blind Delay Spread Estimation using Frequency Correlation for Wireless OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"MCWC-00-40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040437S","chronDate":"17-20 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4375173","isNumber":"4375174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4375173","xplore-issue":"4375174","articleId":"4375214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MOSHARAKAIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4375215,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Hong","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Integrated Microsystem Science & Engineering Applications, PKU shenzhen graduate school, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37956441400"},{"name":"Xin'an Wang","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Integrated Microsystem Science & Engineering Applications, PKU shenzhen graduate school, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xin'an","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407491700"},{"name":"Gaofa Xiao","affiliation":["The Key Laboratory of Integrated Microsystem Science & Engineering Applications, PKU shenzhen graduate school, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Gaofa","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37965797000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-9957-486-00-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4375215","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"abstract":"In OFDM system, because of sensitivity to carrier frequency offset, frequency offset must be compensated before DFT in the receiver.

The information about its conformation can provide essential information for drug design and protein engineering. While there are over a million known protein sequences, only a limited number of protein structures are experimentally determined. Hence, prediction of protein structures from protein sequences using computer programs is an important step to unveil proteins' three dimensional conformation and functions. As a result, prediction of protein structures has profound theoretical and practical influence over biological study. The explanation of how a decision is made during prediction is also important for improving protein structure prediction and guiding the \"wet experiments\". In this talk, we will show how to use machine learning methods to improve the accuracy of protein structure prediction and to interpret prediction results. We will report our research on using neural networks, support vector machines combined with decision tree and association rule for protein structure prediction, rule extraction and prediction interpretation. Evaluation and comparisons of various prediction and rule extraction systems will be presented and future research direction in this area will also be identified.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4375520/4375521/04375533.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","doi":"10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4375521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4375533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protein Structure Prediction and Its Understanding Based on Machine Learning Methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning systems","Protein engineering","Sequences","DNA","RNA","Biochemistry","Drugs","Biology computing","Neural networks","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","data mining","decision trees","learning (artificial intelligence)","molecular biophysics","molecular configurations","neural nets","proteins","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protein structure prediction","machine learning methods","conformation","protein sequences","neural networks","support vector machines","decision tree","association rule"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375533/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Protein Structure Prediction and Its Understanding Based on Machine Learning Methods","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9847526","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protein Structure Prediction and Its Understanding Based on Machine Learning Methods","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"BIBE-00-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123902S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","isNumber":"4375521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4375520","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4375533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4375546,"authors":[{"name":"Yuehui Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, University of Ji''nan, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yuehui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281033700"},{"name":"Xueqin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, University of Ji''nan, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xueqin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37963290200"},{"name":"Mary Qu Yang","affiliation":["U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Bethesda, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Mary Qu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37693499300"},{"name":"Jack Y.

Characterization of these DNA copy number changes is important for both the basic understanding of cancer and its diagnosis. In order to develop effective methods to identify aberration regions from array CGH data, many recent research works focus on both smoothing-based and segmentation-based data processing. In this paper, we propose to use the dual-tree complex wavelet transform to smooth the array CGH data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through theoretic and experimental exploration of a set of array CGH data, including both synthetic data and real data. The comparison results show that our method outperforms the previous approaches.","doi":"10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375556","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4375520/4375521/04375556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4375521","startPage":"137","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising of Array-Based DNA Copy Number Data Using The Dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4375556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Denoising of Array-Based DNA Copy Number Data Using The Dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375556/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9812845","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4375556/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising of Array-Based DNA Copy Number Data Using The Dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"BIBE-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117847S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4375520","isNumber":"4375521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4375520","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4375521","articleId":"4375556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4375622,"authors":[{"name":"Salahuddin Mohammad Masum","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Salahuddin Mohammad","lastName":"Masum","id":"37550696100"},{"name":"Mohammed Yeasin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Yeasin","id":"37282674400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1509-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4375622","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4375622","abstract":"Graph mining techniques for analyzing large collections of molecules to find regularity or patterns among molecules of a specific class, such as finding common properties in large numbers of drug candidates, finding molecular features that inhibit the desired reaction etc. is an important research issue in bioinformatics as well as molecular informatics. In this context, finding frequent graphs has received increasing attention over the past years. But, the computational complexity of the underlying problem and the large amount of data to be explored essentially render traditional sequential algorithms practically useless. To address such problems a distributed algorithm is adopted to find the frequent sub-graphs and to discover interesting patterns in molecular compounds. However, this problem is characterized by a highly irregular search tree, whereby reliable workload prediction is very hard. Therefore, a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the dynamic load-balancing problem of highly irregular search tree.","doi":"10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375622","startPage":"601","endPage":"608","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4375520/4375521/04375622.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4375521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Load Balancing for Mining of Molecular Structures using Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Genetic algorithms","Drugs","Data mining","Pattern analysis","Informatics","Tree graphs","Diseases","Algorithm design and analysis","Bioinformatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","data mining","genetic algorithms","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic load balancing","graph mining","molecular structures","genetic algorithm","molecular informatics","computational complexity","irregular search tree"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Load Balancing","Genetic Algorithm","Drug Discovery","Data Mining","Graph Mining"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375622/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Load Balancing for Mining of Molecular Structures using Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4375622/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9812876","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Load Balancing for Mining of Molecular Structures using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"BIBE-00-101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069998S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4375520","isNumber":"4375521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4375520","xplore-issue":"4375521","articleId":"4375622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4375661,"authors":[{"name":"Afef Elloumi Oueslati","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie Electrique, Unite Signal Image et Reconnaissance de Formes, Tunis, Tunisie"],"firstName":"Afef Elloumi","lastName":"Oueslati","id":"38574287200"},{"name":"Noureddine Ellouze","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie Electrique, Unite Signal Image et Reconnaissance de Formes, Tunis, Tunisie"],"firstName":"Noureddine","lastName":"Ellouze","id":"37394713100"},{"name":"Zied Lachiri","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie Physique et Instrumentation, Tunis, Tunisie"],"firstName":"Zied","lastName":"Lachiri","id":"37832340000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1509-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1509-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4375661","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"abstract":"A Fourier transform technique has been used to enhance the genome periodicities when analyzing the distributions of independent nucleotides and dinucleotides. These periodicities are varying from 2 to 500 bp. In this paper we focus on the 3 and 10.5 periodicities. The 3-base periodicity is characteristic for the protein-coding sequences only. The source of the approximately 10.5-base sequence period is related to the deformability of DNA. In fact, DNA folding in chromatin is facilitated by periodical positioning of some dinucleotides along the sequences, with the period close to 10.5 bases. When the DNA sequence is encoded for the signal 'AA' or 'TT' or 'TA' the peak at 10.5 is locally strengthened. For the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. Elegans) genome, this peak becomes the dominant feature in the transform. Studying one organism's genome requires three steps. First, the DNA coding method: the DNA's string data are transformed into numerical signal. Second, periodicities are detected by spectral analysis. Third, a 3D graphical representation allows following the evolution of this periodicity along the genome and facilitating the specific regions location.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4375520/4375521/04375661.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"871","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","doi":"10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4375521","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4375661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Spectrum Analysis of DNA Sequence: Application to Caenorhabditis elegans Genome","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Sequences","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Proteins","Biomedical signal processing","Signal analysis","Fourier transforms","Spectral analysis","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","biomechanics","bio-optics","cellular biophysics","deformation","DNA","encoding","Fourier transform spectra","molecular biophysics","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D spectrum analysis","DNA sequence","Caenorhabditis elegans genome","Fourier transform analysis","nucleotides","dinucleotides","3-base periodicity","protein-coding sequences","10.5-base sequence","DNA deformability","DNA folding","chromatin","periodical positioning","signal encoding","DNA coding method","DNA string data","3D graphical representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fourier Transform Technique","detecting specific periodicities","3D graphical representation","specific region's location"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"3D Spectrum Analysis of DNA Sequence: Application to Caenorhabditis elegans Genome","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4375661/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9847545","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Spectrum Analysis of DNA Sequence: Application to Caenorhabditis elegans Genome","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"BIBE-00-140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075014S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4375520","isNumber":"4375521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4375520","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4375521","articleId":"4375661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4375664,"authors":[{"name":"Jason D.

The method is based on the average of SimPLD between the GO terms annotated for both genes in a given gene pair.

This work studies the energy merit of interposing flash memory as a streaming buffer between the disk drive and the DRAM. Doing so, we extend the spin-off period of the disk drive and cut down on the DRAM capacity at the cost of (extra) flash. We study two different streaming applications: mobile multimedia players and media servers. Our simulated results show that for light workloads, a system with a flash as a buffer between the disk and the DRAM consumes up to 40% less energy than the same system without a flash buffer. For heavy workloads savings of at least 30% are possible. We also address the wear- out of flash and present a simple solution to extend its lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/ESTMED.2007.4375793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTMED.2007.4375793","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/ACM/IFIP Workshop on Embedded Systems for Real-Time Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/ACM/IFIP Workshop on Embedded Systems for Real-Time Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/4375779/4375780/04375793.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4375780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Interposing Flash between Disk and DRAM to Save Energy for Streaming Workloads","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-5 Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9691012","htmlLink":"/document/4375793/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interposing Flash between Disk and DRAM to Save Energy for Streaming Workloads","confLoc":"Salzburg, Austria","sourcePdf":"ESTMED-00-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10236S","chronDate":"4-5 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4375779","isNumber":"4375780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4375779","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4375780","articleId":"4375793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4375926,"authors":[{"name":"Nenad Denic","affiliation":["Serbian Army, E-mail: denic_v_n@neobee.net"],"firstName":"Nenad","lastName":"Denic","id":"37085971809"},{"name":"Bojan Dimitrijevic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni\u0161, Ni\u0161, Serbia"],"firstName":"Bojan","lastName":"Dimitrijevic","id":"37373218800"},{"name":"Nenad Milosevic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni\u0161, Ni\u0161, Serbia"],"firstName":"Nenad","lastName":"Milosevic","id":"37374218600"},{"name":"Zorica Nikolic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni\u0161, Ni\u0161, Serbia"],"firstName":"Zorica","lastName":"Nikolic","id":"37373220200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1467-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1468-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4375926","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Direction of arrival estimation","Mobile antennas","Receiving antennas","Tracking loops","Multiple access interference","Iterative algorithms","Azimuth","Timing","Directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","direction-of-arrival estimation","mobile antennas","mobile radio","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three dimensional direction lock loop","DS/CDMA systems","direction of arrival estimation","mobile receiver","antennas","S-curves","timing synchronization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction of arrival (DOA)","Direction lock loop (DiLL)","DOA tracking","smart antenna"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an algorithm for three dimensional direction of arrival estimation is proposed.

The second harmonics of the fundamental signals (IM2) together with the fourth-order nonlinear signals (IM4) are led to the output of third amplifier in cascade. The linearization scheme is arranged so that the IM2 signals are extracted at the output of the second amplifier whereas some additional nonlinear component such as MESFET is exploited as the source of IM2+IM4 signals. Generated nonlinear signals are combined, then adjusted in amplitude and phase and put at the third amplifier output. The third amplifier in cascade biased at class-A is harmonically controlled at input and output. This configuration enables high gain of class A amplifier combined with higher-drain efficiency. Consequently, power-aided efficiency is increased. Also, the third- and fifth-order intermodulation products of a complete amplifying system are reduced in a wide range of the input power going close to saturation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4375902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSKS.2007.4375993","publicationTitle":"2007 8th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 8th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/4375901/4375902/04375993.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"290","doi":"10.1109/TELSKS.2007.4375993","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearization of Multichannel Amplifiers Close to Saturation with Improved Efficiency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Linearization of Multichannel Amplifiers Close to Saturation with Improved Efficiency","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4375993/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9834776","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4375993/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearization of Multichannel Amplifiers Close to Saturation with Improved Efficiency","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia and Montenegro","sourcePdf":"TELSKS-00-91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049307S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4375901","isNumber":"4375902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4375901","xplore-issue":"4375902","articleId":"4375993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4376010,"authors":[{"name":"Vesna M.

CP values that are shorter than channel impulse response introduce intersymbol and interchannel interference, that are spectrally concentrated in the case of PLC channel. We show that a tradeoff between eliminating interference and preserving spectral efficiency can be obtained, for the purpose of maximizing system capacity. Practical implication is that short CP length values can give good system performances, despite PLC channel long impulse response durations.","doi":"10.1109/TELSKS.2007.4376010","publicationTitle":"2007 8th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 8th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/4375901/4375902/04376010.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSKS.2007.4376010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4375902","startPage":"347","endPage":"350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of Cyclic Prefix Length in DMT on the PLC System Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Cyclic Prefix Length in DMT on the PLC System Design","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376010/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9834789","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4376010/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Cyclic Prefix Length in DMT on the PLC System Design","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia and Montenegro","sourcePdf":"TELSKS-00-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044387S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4375901","isNumber":"4375902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4375901","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4375902","articleId":"4376010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4376131,"authors":[{"name":"Fernanda B.

A key research issue for the commercial application of automatic presentation is the user experience, which must support the flow of visual analysis. User experience has not been the focus of previous research on automatic presentation. The Show Me user experience includes the automatic selection of mark types, a command to add a single field to a view, and a pair of commands to build views for multiple fields. Although the use of these defaults and commands is optional, user interface logs indicate that Show Me is used by commercial users.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["User

Information Visualization: Depictions of Data in Everyday Life","abstract":"Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose casual information visualization (or casual infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization (Skog et al., 2003), social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative properties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376134/","volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4376134/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9658197","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"17968058","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Casual Information Visualization: Depictions of Data in Everyday Life","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Casual Information Visualization: Depictions of Data in Everyday Life","sourcePdf":"v1145.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054205S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4376125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"4376125","articleId":"4376134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4376143,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey Ellis","affiliation":["Lancaster University, USA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Ellis","id":"37283380700"},{"name":"Alan Dix","affiliation":["Lancaster University, USA"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Dix","id":"37283381700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"4376143","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":227,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2922},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376143","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Taxonomy","Data visualization","Computer displays","Prototypes","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","Software","Government","Usability","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","data visualisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clutter reduction method","information visualisation","visual representation","multivariate data","data classification","large datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clutter reduction","information visualisation","occlusion","large datasets","taxonomy."]}],"abstract":"Information visualisation is about gaining insight into data through a visual representation. This data is often multivariate and increasingly, the datasets are very large. To help us explore all this data, numerous visualisation applications, both commercial and research prototypes, have been designed using a variety of techniques and algorithms. Whether they are dedicated to geo-spatial data or skewed hierarchical data, most of the visualisations need to adopt strategies for dealing with overcrowded displays, brought about by too much data to fit in too small a display space. This paper analyses a large number of these clutter reduction methods, classifying them both in terms of how they deal with clutter reduction and more importantly, in terms of the benefits and losses. The aim of the resulting taxonomy is to act as a guide to match techniques to problems where different criteria may have different importance, and more importantly as a means to critique and hence develop existing and new techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/4376125/04376143.pdf","startPage":"1216","endPage":"1223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Taxonomy of Clutter Reduction for Information Visualisation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376143/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Taxonomy of Clutter Reduction for Information Visualisation","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9706078","pubMedId":"17968067","htmlLink":"/document/4376143/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Taxonomy of Clutter Reduction for Information Visualisation","sourcePdf":"v1216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08446S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4376125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"227","xplore-issue":"4376125","articleId":"4376143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4376144,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Soo Yi","affiliation":["Health Systems Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Ji Soo","lastName":"Yi","id":"38254012600"},{"name":"Youn ah Kang","affiliation":["School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Youn ah","lastName":"Kang","id":"37673524700"},{"name":"John Stasko","affiliation":["School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Stasko","id":"37085483251"},{"name":"J.A.

A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/4376125/04376144.pdf","startPage":"1224","endPage":"1231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward a Deeper Understanding of the Role of Interaction in Information Visualization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Toward a Deeper Understanding of the Role of Interaction in Information Visualization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376144/","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9708705","pubMedId":"17968068","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376144/","volume":"13","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a Deeper Understanding of the Role of Interaction in Information Visualization","sourcePdf":"v1224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118399S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4376125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"410","xplore-issue":"4376125","articleId":"4376144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4376145,"authors":[{"name":"Petra Isenberg","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Petra","lastName":"Isenberg","id":"37591317800"},{"name":"Sheelagh Carpendale","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Sheelagh","lastName":"Carpendale","id":"37285000100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"4376145","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1044},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Collaboration","Collaborative work","Data visualization","Information analysis","Collaborative tools","Biomedical imaging","Data analysis","Technological innovation","Information processing","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","groupware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive tree comparison","colocated collaborative information visualization","shared interactive tabletop display"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information visualization","collaboration","co-located work","hierarchical data comparison"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376145","abstract":"In many domains, increased collaboration has lead to more innovation by fostering the sharing of knowledge, skills, and ideas. Shared analysis of information visualizations does not only lead to increased information processing power, but team members can also share, negotiate, and discuss their views and interpretations on a dataset and contribute unique perspectives on a given problem. Designing technologies to support collaboration around information visualizations poses special challenges and relatively few systems have been designed. We focus on supporting small groups collaborating around information visualizations in a co-located setting, using a shared interactive tabletop display. We introduce an analysis of challenges and requirements for the design of co-located collaborative information visualization systems. We then present a new system that facilitates hierarchical data comparison tasks for this type of collaborative work. Our system supports multi-user input, shared and individual views on the hierarchical data visualization, flexible use of representations, and flexible workspace organization to facilitate group work around visualizations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/4376125/04376145.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70568","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive Tree Comparison for Co-located Collaborative Information Visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376145/","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Tree Comparison for Co-located Collaborative Information Visualization","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376145/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"9658199","pubMedId":"17968069","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Tree Comparison for Co-located Collaborative Information Visualization","sourcePdf":"v1232.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060232S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4376125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4376125","articleId":"4376145","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4376146,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Heer","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Heer","id":"37550791300"},{"name":"George Robertson","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Robertson","id":"37448060300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"4376146","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":190,"citationCountPatent":28,"totalDownloads":1984},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Animation","Graphics","Data visualization","Marketing and sales","Scattering","Taxonomy","Guidelines","Information analysis","Drilling","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer animation","data visualisation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["animated transitions","statistical data graphics","bar charts","pie charts","scatter plots","DynaVis","visualization system","graphical perception"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Statistical data graphics","animation","transitions","information visualization","design","experiment"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of animated transitions between common statistical data graphics such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.

We present an experiment comparing different visual representations of spatialized data, to determine which representations are best for a non-trivial search and point estimation task. Primarily, we compare point-based displays to 2D and 3D information landscapes. We also compare a colour (hue) scale to a grey (lightness) scale. For the task we studied, point-based spatializations were far superior to landscapes, and 2D landscapes were superior to 3D landscapes. Little or no benefit was found for redundantly encoding data using colour or greyscale combined with landscape height. 3D landscapes with no colour scale (height-only) were particularly slow and inaccurate. A colour scale was found to be better than a greyscale for all display types, but a greyscale was helpful compared to height-only. These results suggest that point-based spatializations should be chosen over landscape representations, at least for tasks involving only point data itself rather than derived information about the data space.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/4376125/04376149.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70596","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatialization Design: Comparing Points and Landscapes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376149/","displayDocTitle":"Spatialization Design: Comparing Points and Landscapes","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376149/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"9708706","pubMedId":"17968073","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatialization Design: Comparing Points and Landscapes","sourcePdf":"v1262.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088068S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4376125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4376125","articleId":"4376149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4376154,"authors":[{"name":"Nathalie Henry","affiliation":["University of Sydney, Australia","INRIA Futurs, University of Paris-Sud 11, France"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Henry","id":"37839948300"},{"name":"Jean-Daniel Fekete","affiliation":["INRIA Futurs and Laboratory RI UMR CNRS 5800, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Daniel","lastName":"Fekete","id":"37407972900"},{"name":"Michael J.

Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities.

These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings.

The algorithm, whose goal is to compute layouts accurately and quickly, has two contributions.

Since the GPU requires a data parallel programming model, the challenge is devising a mapping of a naturally unstructured graph into a well-partitioned structured one. This is done by computing a balanced partitioning of a general graph. This algorithm provides a general multi-level scheme, which has the potential to be used not only for computation on the GPU, but also on emerging multi-core architectures. The algorithm manages to compute high quality layouts of large graphs in a fraction of the time required by existing algorithms of similar quality.

Volumetric compression in which the decompression is coupled to rendering has been shown to be an effective solution to this problem; however, most existing techniques were developed in the context of software volume rendering, and all but the simplest approaches are prohibitive in a real-time hardware-accelerated volume rendering context. In this paper we present a novel block-based transform coding scheme designed specifically with real-time volume rendering in mind, such that the decompression is fast without sacrificing compression quality. This is made possible by consolidating the inverse transform with dequantization in such a way as to allow most of the reprojection to be precomputed. Furthermore, we take advantage of the freedom afforded by offline compression in order to optimize the encoding as much as possible while hiding this complexity from the decoder. In this context we develop a new block classification scheme which allows us to preserve perceptually important features in the compression. The result of this work is an asymmetric transform coding scheme that allows very large volumes to be compressed and then decompressed in real-time while rendering on the GPU.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/4376125/04376192.pdf","startPage":"1600","endPage":"1607","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transform Coding for Hardware-accelerated Volume Rendering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Rendering (computer graphics)","Graphics","Hardware","Pipelines","Data visualization","Encoding","Decoding","Resource management","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","data compression","real-time systems","rendering (computer graphics)","transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dequantization","inverse transform","compression quality","software volume rendering","decompression","volumetric compression","large volume data sets","graphics memory","real-time volume rendering","GPU","hardware-accelerated volume rendering","transform coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Volume Compression","Compressed Volume Rendering","Transform Coding","Hardware-accelerated Volume Rendering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"Transform Coding for Hardware-accelerated Volume Rendering","volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4376192/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9658210","pubMedId":"17968115","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transform Coding for Hardware-accelerated Volume Rendering","sourcePdf":"v1600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4376125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4376125","articleId":"4376192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4376229,"authors":[{"name":"Jacek Kopeck\u00fd","affiliation":["Digital Enterprise Research Institute, Innsbruck, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["Jacek Kopeck\u00fd is a researcher at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute in Innsbruck, Austria.

The algorithm produces an improved resolution image from a sequence of low-resolution (LR) video frames with overlapping field of view. The algorithm uses subpixel registration to position each LR pixel value on a common spatial grid that is referenced to the average position of the input frames. The positions of the LR pixels are not quantized to a finite grid as with some previous techniques. The output high-resolution (HR) pixels are obtained using a weighted sum of LR pixels in a local moving window. Using a statistical model, the weights for each HR pixel are designed to minimize the mean squared error and they depend on the relative positions of the surrounding LR pixels. Thus, these weights adapt spatially and temporally to changing distributions of LR pixels due to varying motion. Both a global and spatially varying statistical model are considered here. Since the weights adapt with distribution of LR pixels, it is quite robust and will not become unstable when an unfavorable distribution of LR pixels is observed. For translational motion, the algorithm has a low computational complexity and may be readily suitable for real-time and/or near real-time processing applications. With other motion models, the computational complexity goes up significantly. However, regardless of the motion model, the algorithm lends itself to parallel implementation. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated here in a number of experimental results using simulated and real video sequences. A computational analysis is also presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4376239/04376249.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.909416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.909416","startPage":"2953","endPage":"2964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Image Super-Resolution Algorithm Using an Adaptive Wiener Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376249/","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Image Super-Resolution Algorithm Using an Adaptive Wiener Filter","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376249/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"9674202","pubMedId":"18092595","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Image Super-Resolution Algorithm Using an Adaptive Wiener Filter","sourcePdf":"16tip12-hardie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087956S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4376239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4376239","articleId":"4376249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4376284,"authors":[{"name":"Leopoldo Garcia Franquelo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Seville, Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4352072/4376284/4376284-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leopoldo Garcia Franquelo (M'84\u2013SM'96\u2013F'05) was born in M\u00e1laga, Spain.

By taking this new scenario into account, a new method to generate switching three-level pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) patterns to meet specific grid codes is presented. The proposed method, which is named selective harmonic mitigation PWM , generates switching three-level PWM patterns with high quality from the point of view of harmonic content, avoiding the elimination of some specific harmonics and studying all harmonics and the total harmonic distortion as a global problem by using a general-purpose random-search heuristic algorithm. This fact leads to a drastic reduction or even avoidance of the bulky and costly grid connection tuned filters of power systems. Any harmonic shaping can be considered due to the flexibility of the method. Power devices switching constraints are considered to obtain directly applicable results. As a practical example, limits from one actual grid code have been used to get the experimental results by means of a 150-kVA three-level diode-clamped converter test bench. Comparisons between the proposed technique, optimized PWM and Selective Harmonic Elimination methods have been carried out. The results obtained with this new method greatly improve previous ones.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.907045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4352072/04376284.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.907045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4352072","startPage":"3022","endPage":"3029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible Selective Harmonic Mitigation Technique to Meet Grid Codes in Three-Level PWM Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Selective Harmonic Mitigation Technique to Meet Grid Codes in Three-Level PWM Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376284/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9883769","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4376284/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Selective Harmonic Mitigation Technique to Meet Grid Codes in Three-Level PWM Converters","sourcePdf":"54tie06-franquelo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062573S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4352072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"4352072","articleId":"4376284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4376286,"authors":[{"name":"Darko Hercog","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4352072/4376286/4376286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Darko Hercog (S'03) received the B.Sc. degree in 2001 from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His research interests include real-time systems, digital control implementation, rapid control prototyping, remote control, and virtual instrumentation."]},"firstName":"Darko","lastName":"Hercog","id":"37294952900"},{"name":"Bojan Gergic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4352072/4376286/4376286-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Bojan Gergi\u010d (M'95) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia, in 1993, 1996, and 2000, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","Since 1993, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor.

It is possible to combine the advantages of matrix converters with the advantages of the DTC strategy using space-vector modulation and two PI controllers. To overcome the degrading of dynamic torque response compared with the basic DTC method and the phase-current distortion due to the nonlinearity of the matrix converter, an overmodulation strategy and a simple nonlinearity-compensation method using transformation are also presented. Experimental results are shown to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed strategy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4352072/04376289.pdf","startPage":"3155","endPage":"3166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.905914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.905914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4352072","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved DTC-SVM Method for Sensorless Matrix Converter Drives Using an Overmodulation Strategy and a Simple Nonlinearity Compensation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix converters","Voltage","Reactive power","Torque control","Switching frequency","Pulse width modulation inverters","Induction motors","Induction motor drives","Switches","Commutation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","drives","PI control","power factor","torque control","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DTC-SVM method","sensorless matrix converter drives","overmodulation strategy","simple nonlinearity compensation","direct torque control","minimal torque ripple","unity input power factor","sensorless speed control","torque dynamics","space vector modulation","PI controllers","phase current distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC motor drives","ac\u2013ac power conversion","adaptive observers","induction motor drives"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Improved DTC-SVM Method for Sensorless Matrix Converter Drives Using an Overmodulation Strategy and a Simple Nonlinearity Compensation","volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4376289/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9692653","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved DTC-SVM Method for Sensorless Matrix Converter Drives Using an Overmodulation Strategy and a Simple Nonlinearity Compensation","sourcePdf":"54tie06-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052946S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4352072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4352072","articleId":"4376289","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4376290,"authors":[{"name":"Lucia Lo Bello","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Telecommunications, Universita Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4352072/4376290/4376290-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lucia Lo Bello (M'01) received the M.D. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the University of Catania, Catania, Italy, in 1994 and 1998, respectively.","During the academic year 2000\u20132001, she was a Visiting Researcher with the Department of Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

Each router can be loaded with data flows and monitored over preestablished time windows so as to evaluate its performance in a wide range of operating conditions. The wireless part makes it possible to configure environments with different levels of noise and bandwidth utilization so as to emulate a broad spectrum of real operating environments. The testbed can be used via remote access through a web interface that not only allows the operating conditions to be configured but also permits real-time monitoring.

These currents are known to provoke premature motor-bearing failures, as well as electromagnetic interferences disturbing neighbor electronic devices. Furthermore, high-voltage applications involve high levels of these conducted emissions, which must be lowered by using bulky and expensive filters. This paper aims at elaborating a new pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) strategy in order to reduce the common-mode currents generated by three-level neutral-point-clamped inverters. The proposed strategy also provides the ability to balance the neutral point of the dc-bus capacitors. Experimental results both in time and frequency domains confirm that the new PWM improves the electromagnetic-compatibility behavior of the drive compared with conventional strategies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Pulse width modulation","Variable speed drives","Voltage","Capacitance","Electric machines","Electromagnetic

Analysis of Neutral Stochastic Neural Networks With Delay: An LMI Approach","abstract":"Based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, this paper is concerned with the robust asymptotic stability of neutral stochastic neural networks with delay. First, we discuss the asymptotic stability in mean square of neutral stochastic neural networks without delay in stochastic perturbation and obtain a sufficient condition. This condition is dependent on the size of the time delay, which is usually less conservative than delay-independent ones. Then, we extend the method to cope with the robust asymptotic stability analysis of neutral stochastic neural networks with uncertainties and delay in stochastic perturbation. By employing a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, Jensen's inequality and conducting the stochastic analysis, an LMI approach is developed to derive the stability criteria. The proposed criteria can be checked readily by using some standard numerical packages, and no tuning of parameters is required. Examples are provided to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed criteria.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376330/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9884609","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376330/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Stability Analysis of Neutral Stochastic Neural Networks With Delay: An LMI Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Stability Analysis of Neutral Stochastic Neural Networks With Delay: An LMI Approach","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082072S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4376362,"authors":[{"name":"Qiao Zong-min","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China","Key Laboratory of intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qiao","lastName":"Zong-min","id":"37085967123"},{"name":"Cheng Jia-xing","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Jia-xing","id":"38290645800"},{"name":"Song Jie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Jie","id":"37943683400"},{"name":"Qiao Zong-min","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Hefei Normal University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qiao","lastName":"Zong-min","id":"37085967123"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376362","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376362","abstract":"In this paper, global synchronization approach is discussed for chaotic neural networks with time-varying delay.

The neural network PID control in the variable-frequency air-conditioning system is introduced and simulated. In the learning algorithm of neural network PID controller, the output of system is needed to tune the weights of neural network while it is difficult to obtain. So the output of system is predicted through the algorithm of nonlinear that adopts the neural network configure. Through simulation and optimization, it is found that the neural network PID control has the capability of self-study and self-adaptation. However, the neural network PID control system sometimes has the static error. To eliminate the static error, the hybrid control of neural network PID and conventional PID is applied to the variable-frequency air-conditioning system. The hybrid control is simulated to compare the performance of changed parameters of model. The simulation finds that the hybrid control of neural network PID and PID has both the advantages of neural network and PID, such as self-studying and self-adapting and obtain faster response and better performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376371","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376371.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Neural Network PID Control in Variable-frequency Air-conditioning System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Three-term control","Control systems","Fuzzy control","Automatic control","Inverters","Centralized control","Error correction","Electric variables control","Fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air conditioning","learning systems","neurocontrollers","self-adjusting systems","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network PID control","variable-frequency air-conditioning system","large inertia","learning algorithm","hybrid control","error elimination","self-adaptation capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","PID control","prediction","variable-frequency","air-conditioning system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Study of Neural Network PID Control in Variable-frequency Air-conditioning System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9807912","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Neural Network PID Control in Variable-frequency Air-conditioning System","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055293S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4376387,"authors":[{"name":"Jianguo Zhou","affiliation":["School of Business and Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37596881300"},{"name":"Weijing Yang","affiliation":["School of Business and Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Weijing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37960461300"},{"name":"Yu Shi","affiliation":["School of Business and Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Shi","id":"37960372100"},{"name":"Zhaoming Wu","affiliation":["School of Business and Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37833821800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376387","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376387","abstract":"Much research of theory and application has been done on analytic hierarchy process after it was proposed. But the pair-wise comparison matrix with interval numbers has not been studied very well. In this paper, the indefinite circumstances that exist in the process of decision-making are considered. Therefore, interval numbers are adopted to replace the precise numbers of the judgment matrix when analytic hierarchy process is used. The least deviation method is adopted to calculate the weights of elements according to the interval matrix, which is solved by the particle swarm optimization in order to find the optimal solution. At the same time, the consistency of the matrix is considered. If the consistency of a precise matrix is not acceptable, then the interval matrix based on the precise matrix can solve this problem. The examples are well illustrated this case and the optimal solution is found Anally. As a result, this paper provides one kind of new thought to deal with the interval matrices.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376387","startPage":"395","endPage":"397","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376387.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One Improved Method for Analytic Hierarchy Process Based on Least Deviation Method and Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Decision making","Chromium","Water heating","Humans","Automatic control","Automation","Technology transfer","Resistance heating","Heat transfer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","matrix algebra","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytic hierarchy process","least deviation method","particle swarm optimization","pair-wise comparison matrix","decision-making","judgment matrix","interval matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analytic hierarchy process","weights","interval matrix","least deviation method","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"One Improved Method for Analytic Hierarchy Process Based on Least Deviation Method and Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376387/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9807922","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One Improved Method for Analytic Hierarchy Process Based on Least Deviation Method and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03154S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","articleId":"4376387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4376395,"authors":[{"name":"Jianquan Lu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianquan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37597286200"},{"name":"Daniel W.

This paper presents an approach of single neuron PID adaptive control for BLDCM based on wavelet neural network on-line identification. The method uses single neuron PID to construct the adaptive controller of BLDCM. In addition, a wavelet neural network (WINN) is built to construct the on-line reference model of BLDCM, and then identify the output of the motor. The single neuron PID controller achieves on-line regulation of controller parameters by self learning algorithm. And the identification network provides the gradient information needed by the algorithm. In this paper, a TMS320F2812 digital signal processor (DSP) is used to implement this control scheme. And the experimental result shows that the method proposed by this paper can achieve on-line identification and on-line control with high control accuracy, good static and dynamic characteristic and strong robustness.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376429","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376429.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"620","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speed Control of Brushless DC Motor Based on Single Neuron PID and Wavelet Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Speed Control of Brushless DC Motor Based on Single Neuron PID and Wavelet Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9807951","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4376429/","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speed Control of Brushless DC Motor Based on Single Neuron PID and Wavelet Neural Network","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046499S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4376451,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanming Ding","affiliation":["Liaoning Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, University Key Laboratory of Information Sciences and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Yuanming","lastName":"Ding","id":"37277996900"},{"name":"Akira Sano","affiliation":["Department of System Design Engineering Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Sano","id":"37276868400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376451","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system modeling","Power amplifiers","OFDM","Predistortion","Inverse problems","Table lookup","Nonlinear distortion","Nonlinear control systems","High power amplifiers","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinearity compensation","power amplifier","OFDM system","query-based local inverse modeling approach","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","Wiener-Hammerstein structure","look-up table","64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation"]}],"abstract":"A query-based local inverse modeling approach is proposed to compensate nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for fault diagnosis in satellite attitude determination system.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376518","startPage":"1052","endPage":"1055","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376518.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using RBF Neural Network for Fault Diagnosis in Satellite ADS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376518/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using RBF Neural Network for Fault Diagnosis in Satellite ADS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376518/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9807801","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using RBF Neural Network for Fault Diagnosis in Satellite ADS","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055753S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4376521,"authors":[{"name":"Guang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Information Security, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China","Department of Watercraft Engineering, Zhenjiang Watercraft College, Zhenjiang, China"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37854459700"},{"name":"Xiaoping Wu","affiliation":["Department of Information Security, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoping","lastName":"Wu","id":"37657385700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376521","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376521","abstract":"Aimed at the limitation of feedforward and feedback ANN, and the shortcoming that the diagnostic characteristic parameters are considered separately in conventional fault forecast method for machinery equipment, the multivariable gray model, MGM(l,n), and RBF network are introduced into fault prediction, which allows characteristic parameters to be described from the viewpoint of systems.

The paper presents an approach for designing compensators for shaping the closed-loop attitude step response using H-Infinity output-feedback design techniques. Simplified conditions are used which only require the solution of two coupled matrix design equations. The problem of stabilization of the angular position vector of an autonomous rotorcraft platform in a hover configuration is addressed. This paper extends previous designs by giving an H-Infinity design for a tracking controller for all three attitude states. In previous work, only two attitudes were commanded, namely roll and pitch. This paper thereby lays the foundation for future work in closing an outer control loop for hover and station-keeping control of UAV helicopters. The rotorcraft model is first loop shaped to achieve desired characteristics about the hover operating condition. A numerically efficient solution algorithm to solve the H-Infinity coupled design equations is used. A major contribution is that an initial stabilizing gain is not needed. The efficacy of the control law and the disturbance accommodation properties are shown on a rotorcraft design example.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376545.pdf","startPage":"1174","endPage":"1179","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attitude Control System Design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using H-Infinity and Loop-shaping Methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","H infinity control","Helicopters","Control systems","Attitude control","Riccati equations","Robotics and automation","Output feedback","Shape control","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attitude control","feedback","Hinfin control","helicopters","matrix algebra","remotely operated vehicles","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicles","loop-shaping","helicopter attitude control system","tracking control","H-Infinity output-feedback","matrix design equations","angular position vector","autonomous rotorcraft"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","Output Feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Attitude Control System Design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using H-Infinity and Loop-shaping Methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376545/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9884550","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attitude Control System Design for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using H-Infinity and Loop-shaping Methods","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123507S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4376549,"authors":[{"name":"Cai Hua","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Cai","lastName":"Hua","id":"37269359200"},{"name":"Fan Weihua","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Weihua","id":"37269359500"},{"name":"Mu Jingqing","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Mu","lastName":"Jingqing","id":"37945224200"},{"name":"Hu Weili","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Weili","id":"37269352400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376549","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376549","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Networked control systems","Delay systems","Delay effects","Actuators","Communication system control","Automatic control","Design methodology","Design automation","Control system synthesis","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","delays","distributed control","linear matrix inequalities","observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["networked control system","long delay","output delay","observer","switched system theory","LMI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["networked control system","long delay"]}],"abstract":"A class of networked control systems with long control and output delay is considered, the stage is used to fix the control delay, and an observer is designed to compensate the output delay, the model of the networked control system is given.

To solve the deficiency of neural network such as decision of structure and adjustment of parameters in hidden-unit, this paper presents an adaptive speed control approach based on genetic algorithm tuning radial basis function (RBF) neural network controller for brushless DC motor. In this approach, the RBF neural network whose structure and parameters of hidden-unit have been trained by genetic algorithm off-line constitutes a speed loop controller. The controller tunes parameters of neural network adaptively via the self-modifiability of network on-line, while the motor is running. At the same time, the current loop controller traces the change of given current rapidly, so that the system can adapt to variational environment. The results of experiments prove that the approach has lots of good performances in response speed, control accuracy, adaptability and robust.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control

In this research, a multi-layer feedforward neural network controller is proposed. The neural network based controller has the advantage of adaptive learning ability, and can work under the situation when the input voltage and load current fluctuate. Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation training algorithm is used in computer simulation. The neural controller is then implemented on hardware using a DSP (digital signal processor).

It is shown that the responses of RBF neural network are faster and more accurate than back propagation.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376633","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376633.pdf","startPage":"1614","endPage":"1619","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Power Point Estimation for Photovoltaic Systems Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Power Point Estimation for Photovoltaic Systems Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9807855","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4376633/","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Power Point Estimation for Photovoltaic Systems Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085774S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4376636,"authors":[{"name":"Xianyao Meng","affiliation":["Automation and Electrical Engineering Institute, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xianyao","lastName":"Meng","id":"37336496900"},{"name":"Xinjie Han","affiliation":["Automation and Electrical Engineering Institute, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xinjie","lastName":"Han","id":"37825286200"},{"name":"Qingyang Xu","affiliation":["Automation and Electrical Engineering Institute, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Qingyang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085349584"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376636","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376636","abstract":"The BP neural network has been widely applied on fault diagnose.

This controller combines the backstepping and sliding mode control, and the tracking error of the system is ultimately bounded. The recursive nature of this approach is similar to the standard backstepping, and the difference is that we use backstepping to design virtual controller including a zero-order sliding mode at each recursive step. The benefit of this approach is that each virtual controller can compensate for unknown bounded functions which represent unmodelled dynamics and disturbances. Stability analysis results are discussed, which show that the closed-loop system is ultimately bounded. Finally, we establish the reduced model of a class of nonholonomic mobile manipulators, and use the method in the output tracking control of the nonholonomic mobile manipulators. Numerical simulations are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Backstepping Sliding Mode Control of a Class of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376695","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376695.pdf","startPage":"1916","endPage":"1921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Backstepping Sliding Mode Control of a Class of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376695/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9799726","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Backstepping Sliding Mode Control of a Class of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065338S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4376699,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjun Liu","affiliation":["Research Center of Information and Control, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Yanjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37577989800"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Research Center of Information and Control, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280461100"},{"name":"Ruijun Zhu","affiliation":["Research Center of Information and Control, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Ruijun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37423187900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376699","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","MIMO","Nonlinear systems","Adaptive systems","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed circuit television","fuzzy control","Hinfin control","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","observers","tracking","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["observer-based adaptive fuzzy Hinfin tracking control","uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems","closed-loop system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive control","nonlinear systems","fuzzy control"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive fuzzy H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">infin</sub>\n tracking control scheme is proposed for uncertain MIMO nonlinear system with the external disturbances.

The algorithm implements the wavelet transform by time-sharing LUT and operation with small memory, and it farthest eliminates the hardware resource necessary for multiplication operation while ensuring operation precision and speed. The problem of combining segmented data to realize high precision multiplication operation is solved. Compared with multiplication operation, the fragment LUT operation is simpler and faster, and can be implemented easily by VLSI. The algorithm is verified on Altera's FLEX10K30 FPGA. And the result shows the performance of the algorithm: with only 256 times 8 bits on-chip RAM, and the calculation precision is up to 14 -bit binary, the transform time can be up to 74 ns. So using the fragment LUT to implement wavelet transform is faster than using algorithms implemented in general logic.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376714.pdf","startPage":"2017","endPage":"2020","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Algorithm for 9-7 Discrete Wavelet Transform Based on Fragment Look-up Table","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Table lookup","Wavelet transforms","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Image coding","Very large scale integration","Read-write memory","Transform coding","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","system-on-chip","table lookup","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["9-7 discrete wavelet transform","fragment look-up table","multiplication operation","VLSI","FPGA","onchip RAM","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["discrete wavelet transform","lifting scheme","fragment look-up table","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Algorithm for 9-7 Discrete Wavelet Transform Based on Fragment Look-up Table","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376714/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9807616","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Algorithm for 9-7 Discrete Wavelet Transform Based on Fragment Look-up Table","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048348S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376714","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4376746,"authors":[{"name":"Hongfu Zhou","affiliation":["Mechanical School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hongfu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37879496700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376746","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Master-slave","Velocity control","Automatic control","Motion control","Servomotors","Motor drives","Engine cylinders","Feedback","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clamps","injection moulding","motion control","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization controller","injection mould machine","master-slave connection","clamping motor","master-slave synchronization control","motion control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synchronization controller","Injection Mould machine","Compax3 drive and amplifier","Motion controller","Parker amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376746","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376746.pdf","startPage":"2178","endPage":"2182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture on Clamping Motors Synchronized Controller in Injection Mould machine","abstract":"The paper presented three methods for synchronization controllers in clamping unit of injection mould machine, which are multi motors parallel connection, serial connection and master-slave connection methods.

However, its application is limited because of the rotor position sensors and torque ripple. This paper proposes an approach to tackle sensorless control and torque ripple minimization of SRM by using flexible neural networks (FNN) which have many great advantages, such as less nerve cells and quick learning speed. Two FNN are built: through measurement of the phase flux linkages and phase currents, the first one is able to estimate the rotor position, thereby facilitating elimination of the rotor position sensor. The second one is for the estimation of the reference currents with a desired torque, then the real currents in the armatures are adjusted according to the reference values, therefore the torque ripple generated by the non-ideal current waveforms is minimized for a sensorless SRM. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the improvements of the proposed method compared with traditional controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376779/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9807664","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376779/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Torque Ripple Minimization in a Sensorless Switched Reluctance Motor Based on Flexible Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque Ripple Minimization in a Sensorless Switched Reluctance Motor Based on Flexible Neural Networks","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049692S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4376782,"authors":[{"name":"Changbing Li","affiliation":["Automation Academy, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Changbing","lastName":"Li","id":"37291257500"},{"name":"Changxiu Cao","affiliation":["Automation Academy, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Changxiu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37271420800"},{"name":"Yinguo Li","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yinguo","lastName":"Li","id":"37086414954"},{"name":"Yibin Yu","affiliation":["Automation Academy, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yibin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37292220400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376782","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Routing","Quality of service","Delay","Multicast algorithms","NP-hard problem","Genetic mutations","Cost function","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","multicast communication","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","quality of service","set theory","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","particle swarm optimization","multicast QoS routing","multimedia application","quality of service","NP-hard problem","evolutionary scheme","optimization","Pareto set","multicast tree topology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376782","abstract":"Multicast routing is an effective way to communicate among multiple hosts in a network. For multimedia applications, the routing algorithms should consider many Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as delay, cost and so on to find a new route. However, to find routes with two or more QoS parameters is an NP-hard problem. This paper describes a new evolutionary scheme for optimization of multicast QoS routing based on the hybrid of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), called HGAPSO. In HGAPSO, individuals in a new generation are created, not only by crossover and mutation operation as in GA, but also by PSO. The upper-half of the best-performing individuals in a population are regarded as elites. Instead of being reproduced directly to the next generation, these elites are first enhanced. The group constituted by the elites is regarded as a swarm, and each elite corresponds to a particle within it. In this regard, the elites are enhanced by PSO, an operation which mimics the maturing phenomenon in nature. This scheme can simultaneously optimize the cost of the tree, the maximum end-to-end delay, the average delay and the maximum link utilization. In this way, a set of optimal solutions, known as Pareto set, is calculated in only one run, without a priori restrictions. It has revealed an efficient method of the reconstruction of multicast tree topology and the experimental results demonstrated better performance than the conventional GA optimization method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376782","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376782.pdf","startPage":"2355","endPage":"2359","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid of Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for Multicast QoS Routing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid of Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for Multicast QoS Routing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9807665","publicationDate":"May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4376782/","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid of Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization for Multicast QoS Routing","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043591S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4376790,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37308136000"},{"name":"Zhaoming Lei","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoming","lastName":"Lei","id":"37559071900"},{"name":"Hexu Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hexu","lastName":"Sun","id":"37277692700"},{"name":"Tao Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37674389500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376790","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Networked control systems","Communication system control","Actuators","Sensor systems","Automatic control","Access protocols","Adaptive control","Delay","Design automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","control engineering computing","control system synthesis","MIMO systems","observability","reachability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO networked control system","actuator","sensor","communication sequence matrix","periodic medium access scheduling","observability","reachability","observer-based controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NCS","MAC","reachability","observability"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new NCS framework protocol, in which the plant and controller forgo the use of ZOHs, and instead choose to \"ignore\" the actuators and sensors that are not actively communicating. \"Communication sequences\" are used to describe the instantaneous medium access status of the sensors and actuators.

We study the stabilization of NCSs under periodic medium access scheduling. One can always find (via a simple algorithm) periodic communication sequences that preserve the reachability and observability of a reversible linear plant. Using these effective communication sequences, an NCS can be exponentially stabilized by an observer-based controller.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Controller Design for a Class of MIMO Networked Control Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376790","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376790.pdf","startPage":"2391","endPage":"2395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Controller Design for a Class of MIMO Networked Control Systems","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376790/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9799743","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Controller Design for a Class of MIMO Networked Control Systems","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044113S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4376791,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Han","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering College, Wuhan University of China, WuHan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Han","id":"37631397500"},{"name":"Deng Changhong","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering College, Wuhan University of China, WuHan, China"],"firstName":"Deng","lastName":"Changhong","id":"37372661200"},{"name":"Li Dalu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering College, Wuhan University of China, WuHan, China"],"lastName":"Li Dalu","id":"37087283154"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376791","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376791","abstract":"In stability analysis, only particular areas need to be further detailed simulation and analyzed.

And the calculating amount of multiplication about the DFT algorithm is half of general DFT algorithm. The key of the reconstruction is to separate original sampling signal into superposition of several uniformity sampling signals, which make it possible to adopt Shannon theorem. Because there is no time deviation between actual and theoretic sampling point, the precision of interpolating formulae is improved obviously. The accuracy of interpolation algorithm is verified by simulation results. The non-uniform synchronous sampling method, the DFT algorithm and the reconstruction algorithm can be applied extensively in the power supply monitoring system.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376828","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376828.pdf","startPage":"2581","endPage":"2583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fourier Transform and Reconstruction of Periodic Signal Based on Non-Uniformity Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376828/","displayDocTitle":"Fourier Transform and Reconstruction of Periodic Signal Based on Non-Uniformity Sampling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9807685","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376828/","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier Transform and Reconstruction of Periodic Signal Based on Non-Uniformity Sampling","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-521.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03879S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4376840,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Ji","affiliation":["School of Communication and Control Engineering, Southern Yangtze University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Ji","id":"37069138700"},{"name":"Baotong Cui","affiliation":["School of Communication and Control Engineering, Southern Yangtze University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Baotong","lastName":"Cui","id":"37397308700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376840","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Neural networks","Delay effects","Artificial neural networks","Control engineering","Lyapunov method","Sufficient conditions","Neurons","Automatic control","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","robust control","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global robust stability","neural networks","time-varying delays","unbounded delays","Lyapunov functions","equilibrium point"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376840","abstract":"This paper considers the global robust stability of neural networks with both time-varying and unbounded delays.

The proposed generalized ADALINE, called GADALINE, has two aspects of generalization: i) the input now consists of a tapped delay line of the system input signal and a tapped delay line of the system output feedback; and ii) the adaptive learning is further generalized by adding a momentum term to the weight adjustment during convergence period. The GADALINE's learning curve is smoothed by turning off the momentum once the error is within a given small number. Simulation results show that GADALINE provides a much faster convergence speed and better tracking of time varying parameters. The low computational complexity makes this method suitable for online system identification and real time adaptive control applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376853","startPage":"2705","endPage":"2709","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCA.2007.4376853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376307","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376306/4376307/04376853.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized ADALINE Neural Network for System Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376853/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Generalized ADALINE Neural Network for System Identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376853/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9884486","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized ADALINE Neural Network for System Identification","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046282S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4376868,"authors":[{"name":"Haiming Jing","affiliation":["School of Computer, Shijiazhuang Railway Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Haiming","lastName":"Jing","id":"37971704600"},{"name":"Ning Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer, Shijiazhuang Railway Institute, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37849297100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0817-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0818-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3449"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3457"}],"articleNumber":"4376868","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4376868","abstract":"In this paper, a mathematical model is built, we study the dynamic behavior of Hopfield neural network.

It is with simple piecewise-linear dynamics, global convergence to optimal solutions, and ability to handle linear-programs and quadratic-programs in real time and in the same manner. In this paper, to further reduce the implementation and computational complexities, a simplified LVI-PDNN model (T.L. Friesz et al., 1994) is investigated. Interesting numerical results and properties of this simplified LVI-based primal-dual neural network are discussed.

This paper proposes a method which is a combinative arithmetic including BP (backpropagation), RBF (radial basis function) and PID control algorithm to tackle this problem. The relationship of proportional coefficient, integral coefficient and differential coefficient of conventional PID is usually linear, so the output of PID controller can not control nonlinear process perfectly. The combinative arithmetic is efficient to adapt the nonlinear vulcanization process. We can get nonlinear relationship of these three coefficients through the outputs of BP Neural Network which can be nonlinear. Simulation result shows that this method has got the adaptive characteristic and is feasible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4376949/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9884511","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4376949/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"30 May-1 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vulcanization Control of Rubber Fender Based on Neural Network PID Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vulcanization Control of Rubber Fender Based on Neural Network PID Method","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"ICCA-00-642.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047805S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 1 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376306","isNumber":"4376307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376306","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4376307","articleId":"4376949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4376991,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Here we consider Devnagari, Bangla, Telugu, Oriya, Kannada and Tamil scripts for our experiment. The features used in the classifier are obtained from the directional information of the numerals. For feature computation, the bounding box of a numeral is segmented into blocks and the directional features are computed in each of the blocks. These blocks are then down sampled by a Gaussian filter and the features obtained from the down sampled blocks are fed to a modified quadratic classifier for recognition. Here we have used two sets of feature. We have used 64 dimensional features for high-speed recognition and 400 dimensional features for high-accuracy recognition in our proposed system. A five-fold cross validation technique has been used for result computation and we obtained 99.56%, 98.99%, 99.37%, 98.40%, 98.71% and 98.51% accuracy from Devnagari, Bangla, Telugu, Oriya, Kannada, and Tamil scripts, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2007.4377015","startPage":"749","endPage":"753","publicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2007.4377015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4376969","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376968/4376969/04377015.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handwritten Numeral Recognition of Six Popular Indian Scripts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4377015/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Handwritten Numeral Recognition of Six Popular Indian Scripts","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4377015/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9870052","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handwritten Numeral Recognition of Six Popular Indian Scripts","confLoc":"Curitiba, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28220749.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041794S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376968","isNumber":"4376969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376968","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4376969","articleId":"4377015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4377018,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The core of this system is an optical ring resonator-hased broadband, continuously tunable optical beam forming network (OBFN). In the proposed system architecture, filter-based optical single-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation and balanced coherent optical detection are used. Such architecture has significant advantages over a straightforward architecture using optical double-sideband modulation and direct optical detection, namely relaxed bandwidth requirements on the optical modulators and detectors, reduced complexity of the OBFN chip, and enhanced dynamic range. Initial measurements on an actual 1 times 8 OBFN chip and an optical sideband filter chip arc presented. Both are realized in CMOS-compatible planar optical waveguide technology.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2007.4378143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378110","startPage":"88","endPage":"91","displayPublicationTitle":"Microwave Photonics, 2007 Interntional Topical Meeting on","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378109/4378110/04378143.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phased Array Receive Antenna Steering System Using a Ring Resonator-Based Optical Beam Forming Network and Filter-Based Optical SSB-SC Modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4378143/","displayDocTitle":"Phased Array Receive Antenna Steering System Using a Ring Resonator-Based Optical Beam Forming Network and Filter-Based Optical SSB-SC Modulation","conferenceDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9812453","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phased Array Receive Antenna Steering System Using a Ring Resonator-Based Optical Beam Forming Network and Filter-Based Optical SSB-SC Modulation","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"MWP-00-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073018S","chronDate":"3-5 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378109","isNumber":"4378110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378109","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4378110","articleId":"4378143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4378151,"authors":[{"name":"Joao M.

The demodulator observes the various intermodulation products to compute a set of sufficient statistics, while the detector observes the sufficient statistics to compute an estimate of the original data. Particularly, we concentrate on the uplink of intensity modulation/direct detection RoF system where the OFDM signal suffers from linear distortion (fading), nonlinear distortion and noise.

The attraction of producing, and exploiting nanoparticles (NPs; one dimension less than 100 nm) is a consequence of the fact that the properties are often strikingly different from bulk forms composed from the same material. As a consequence, the field of nanotechnology has generated substantial interest resulting in incorporation of NPs into a wide variety of products including electronics, food, clothing, medicines, cosmetics and sporting equipment. While there is general recognition that nanotechnology has the potential to advance science, quality of life and to generate substantial financial gains, a number of reports suggest that potential toxicity should be considered in order to allow the safe and sustainable development of such products. For example, substances which are ordinarily innocuous can elicit toxicity due to the altered chemical and physical properties that become evident within nano dimensions leading to potentially detrimental consequences for the producer, consumer or environment. Research into respirable air pollution particles (PM\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sub>\n) has focused on the role of ultra fine particle (diameter less than 100 nm) in inducing oxidative stress leading to inflammation and resulting in exacerbation of preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological studies have repeatedly found a positive correlation between the level of particulate air pollution and increased morbidity and mortality rates in both adults and children. Such studies have also identified a link between respiratory ill health and the number of ambient ultrafine particles. In vivo and in vitro toxicology studies confirm that for low solubility, low toxicity materials such as TiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n, carbon black and polystyrene beads, ultrafine particles are more toxic and inflammogenic than fine particles. In many of these studies the term \"ultrafine particle\" can be directly exchanged for nanoparticle, as these particles are manufactured industrially. In such studies the NPs generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to a greater extent than larger particles leading to increased transcription of pro-inflammatory mediators via intracellular signaling pathways including calcium and oxidative stress. To date, only limited NP compositions and structures have been tested, including materials such as carbon, polystyrene beads and TiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n as surrogate particles that aimed to represent particulate air pollution. All of these materials are generally low toxicity and low solubility. Much work is required to identify whether the conclusions made for such materials can be extrapolated to engineered nanoparticles varying not only in size but also, shape, composition, structure, surface area, surface coating, and aggregation state. Therefore, it is necessary to reveal if the diversity of NPs available will confer to a varied extent and mechanisms of toxicity.","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2007.909005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2007.909005","startPage":"331","endPage":"340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel5/7728/4384667/04378199.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4384667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Air Pollution, Ultrafine and Nanoparticle Toxicology: Cellular and Molecular Interactions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 December 2007","displayDocTitle":"Air Pollution, Ultrafine and Nanoparticle Toxicology: Cellular and Molecular Interactions","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9757226","pubMedId":"18217626","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4378199/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Air Pollution, Ultrafine and Nanoparticle Toxicology: Cellular and Molecular Interactions","sourcePdf":"06tnb04-stone.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.307314S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"4384667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"241","xplore-issue":"4384667","articleId":"4378199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4378205,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Fernando Velasquez-Garcia","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories and the Gas Turbine Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4389159/4378205/4378205-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luis Fernando Vel\u00e1squez-Garc\u00eda received the bachelor's degrees in mechanical engineering (valedictorian of the School of Engineering, magna cum laude) and civil engineering (valedictorian of the School of Engineering, magna cum laude) from the Universidad de los Andes, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, in 1998 and 1999, respectively, and the M.Sc. degree in aeronautics and astronautics and the Ph.D. degree in space propulsion from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","In 2004, he was a Postdoctoral Associate with the Microsystems Technology Laboratories and the Gas Turbine Laboratory, MIT, where he has been a Research Scientist since 2005.

To be more specific, the measured stator phase current is filtered through a complex wavelet. Theoretical analysis validates that the spectrum of the modulus of the result of the filtering is free from the fundamental supply frequency component, and the fault characteristics can be highlighted. This is advantageous, especially if the induction machine operates at low slip values, where the characteristic frequency components of the rotor fault are very close to the fundamental frequency component. At the same time, by matching the wavelet function to the frequencies of the faulty components, a narrow bandpass filter at the frequency region of the fault characteristic spectral components is obtained. Furthermore, in the context of this paper, features extracted using the proposed technique are used as input to a support vector machine classifier that is employed for the detection of the rotor fault. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Machine Rotor Fault Diagnosis Technique Using Complex Wavelets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2007.895872","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4505383/04378206.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2007.895872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Machine Rotor Fault Diagnosis Technique Using Complex Wavelets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4378206/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"9960817","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Machine Rotor Fault Diagnosis Technique Using Complex Wavelets","sourcePdf":"23tec02-tsoumas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106836S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4505383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4505383","articleId":"4378206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4378207,"authors":[{"name":"Rafal Wrobel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/4453975/4378207/4378207-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rafal Wrobel received the M.Sc. degree in engineering from the Technical University of Opole, Poland, and the Ph.D. degree from the Technical University of Lodz, Poland, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.","From 2001, he was with the Technical University of Opole as an Assistant Professor.

These designs are benchmarked against a conventional 1.5 slots/pole external-rotor brushless dc machine. These candidate electrical machine versions are characterized by having the same external-rotor diameter, total slot area available for the winding and by equal volumes of permanent magnet (PM). Based on the analysis, the most promising motor structure was selected and a prototype wheel-hub motor has been built for application in a small electrical vehicle.

In this paper, technology mapping and cell merger algorithms for asynchronous threshold networks are introduced. The cell merger problem is a restricted form of technology mapping where only adjacent cells are merged. The two algorithms can each target either delay or area, or a combined delay-area cost function. Experiments were performed on substantial industrial design examples (DES and GCD circuits) that had already been optimized by an existing commercial asynchronous synthesis tool flow. Average delay improvements of 31.6% for basic technology mapping and 29.6% for basic cell merger were obtained. Average area improvements of 9.5% for basic technology mapping and 8.5% for basic cell merger were also obtained. Additional experiments were performed on the largest MCNC combinational benchmarks with similar results. Finally, targeting a hybrid cost function, area minimization under specified hard timing constraints, a further area reduction of up to 10.7% on average in technology mapping was recovered without compromising the overall system performance. The new algorithms are the first systematic and general mapping approach for asynchronous threshold networks, targeting delay or area, which preserve the timing-robustness properties of the initial unoptimized circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9920486","volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4378212/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Technology Mapping and Cell Merger for Asynchronous Threshold Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technology Mapping and Cell Merger for Asynchronous Threshold Networks","sourcePdf":"27tcad04-jeong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104474S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4475241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4475241","articleId":"4378212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4378213,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitri Maslov","affiliation":["Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Maslov","id":"37272368000"},{"name":"Gerhard W.

In this paper, we consider a local optimization technique based on templates to simplify and reduce the depth of nonoptimal quantum circuits. We present and analyze templates in the general case and provide particular details for the circuits composed of NOT, CNOT, and controlled-sqrt-of-NOT gates. We apply templates to optimize various common circuits implementing multiple control Toffoli gates and quantum Boolean arithmetic circuits. We also show how templates can be used to compact the number of levels of a quantum circuit. The runtime of our implementation is small, whereas the reduction in the number of quantum gates and number of levels is significant.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum Circuit Simplification and Level Compaction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2007.911334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4454003/04378213.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2007.911334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378213/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Quantum Circuit Simplification and Level Compaction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4378213/","dateOfInsertion":"15 February 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9794368","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum Circuit Simplification and Level Compaction","sourcePdf":"27tcad03-maslov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049526S","chronDate":"March  2008","isNumber":"4454003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"117","articleId":"4378213","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378216,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Acar","affiliation":["IC Design Group, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4392469/4378216/4378216-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mustafa Acar (S'06) was born in Gaziantep, Turkey, in 1979.

The binary sequence method is well known in the literature for genomic signal processing. As an alternative to the binary sequence method, this paper presents a new view to the genomic sequence processing with the electron-ion interaction potential (EIIP) values for nucleotides. The efficacy of the EIIP values-based method is demonstrated through implementation results for the prediction of the gene F56F11.4 with five exons and for cystic-fibrosis gene identification. The biological function of a protein is determined by the amino-acid sequence within the protein. Identification of the amino acids (hot spots) that contribute to the characteristic frequency characterizing a particular biological function is an important task in the protein sequence analysis. Hence, using EIIP values for amino acids, this paper presents a continuous-wavelet transform approach using the modified Morlet wavelet for the identification of active sites (hot spots) in a protein sequence. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated through implementation results on hemoglobin human alpha, human immunodeficiency virus, and oncogene protein sequences.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Genomics and Proteomics Using DSP Techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.910541","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4459817/04378220.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.910541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Genomics and Proteomics Using DSP Techniques","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4378220/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9794193","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Genomics and Proteomics Using DSP Techniques","sourcePdf":"55tcsi01-rao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06012S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4459817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4459817","articleId":"4378220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4378222,"authors":[{"name":"Dilip P.

A switched-current-resistor (SCR) technique minimizes the bandwidth variation and the transient in gain tuning by stabilizing, concurrently, the PGA's feedback factor and quiescent-operating point. Another technique, inside-opamp dc-offset canceller (DOC), embeds inside the PGA's opamp a subthreshold-biased - integrator for extracting its output dc-offset, while negatively feeding the correction (current) signal back to the opamp at an inherent low-impedance node. The resultant main benefits are: 1) the chip area, for realizing the large time constant in dc-offset extraction, is very small and 2) the lower cutoff of the PGA and the DOC-induced nonlinearity and noise are all suppressed by an amount of the loop gain in closed-loop formation. A 1-V three-stage 52-dB gain range PGA reinforcing such two techniques was designed and fabricated in a 3.3-V 0.35- CMOS process. It consumes 7.4 mW of power while measuring gain-switching transient and IIP3.

The results reveal that the proposed method can uniformly improve the cell-boundary performance and double the service coverage at the same power budget with only a slight modification of the conventional methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Macrocell Cooperation for OFDM-Based Broadcast-Packet Data Transmission in a Cellular Network","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.911613","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4472070/04378251.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.911613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4472070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Macrocell Cooperation for OFDM-Based Broadcast-Packet Data Transmission in a Cellular Network","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4378251/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9966448","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Macrocell Cooperation for OFDM-Based Broadcast-Packet Data Transmission in a Cellular Network","sourcePdf":"57tvt02-kang-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06659S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4472070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4472070","articleId":"4378251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4378253,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Hemmati","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4384367/4378253/4378253-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamid Hemmati received the M.A. degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, and the Ph.D. degree from Colorado State University, Fort Collins, both in physics.","He is a Principal Member of Technical Staff and Supervisor of the Optical Communications Group, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology, Pasadena.

While cryptography is a powerful tool to achieve information security, one of the main challenges in cryptosystems is to maintain the secrecy of the cryptographic keys. Though biometric authentication can be used to ensure that only the legitimate user has access to the secret keys, a biometric system itself is vulnerable to a number of threats. A critical issue in biometric systems is to protect the template of a user which is typically stored in a database or a smart card. The fuzzy vault construct is a biometric cryptosystem that secures both the secret key and the biometric template by binding them within a cryptographic framework. We present a fully automatic implementation of the fuzzy vault scheme based on fingerprint minutiae. Since the fuzzy vault stores only a transformed version of the template, aligning the query fingerprint with the template is a challenging task. We extract high curvature points derived from the fingerprint orientation field and use them as helper data to align the template and query minutiae. The helper data itself do not leak any information about the minutiae template, yet contain sufficient information to align the template and query fingerprints accurately. Further, we apply a minutiae matcher during decoding to account for nonlinear distortion and this leads to significant improvement in the genuine accept rate. We demonstrate the performance of the vault implementation on two different fingerprint databases. We also show that performance improvement can be achieved by using multiple fingerprint impressions during enrollment and verification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378259/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9872703","htmlLink":"/document/4378259/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint-Based Fuzzy Vault: Implementation and Performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint-Based Fuzzy Vault: Implementation and Performance","sourcePdf":"02tifs04-nandakumar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081457S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4380296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"346","xplore-issue":"4380296","articleId":"4378259","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4378267,"authors":[{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Ministry of Education, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4538072/4378267/4378267-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guang-Hong Yang (SM'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Northeast University of Technology, Shenyang, China, in 1983 and 1986, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China (formerly, Northeast University of Technology), in 1994.","He is currently a Professor with the College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University. from 1986 to 1995, he was a Lecturer/Associate Professor with Northeastern University. in 1996, he was as a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. from 2001 to 2005, he was a Research Scientist/Senior Research Scientist with the National University of Singapore, Singapore.

In the presence of acoustic background noise or distortion due to tandeming operations, the postfilter parameters are not adjusted and the performance is, therefore, not optimal. We propose a modification that consists of replacing the nonadaptive postfilter parameters with parameters that adapt to variations in spectral flatness, obtained from the noisy speech. This generalization of the postfiltering concept can handle a larger range of noise conditions, but has the same computational complexity and memory requirements as the conventional postfilter. Test results indicate that the presented algorithm improves on the standard postfilter, as well as on the combination of a noise attenuation preprocessor and the conventional postfilter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Acoustic noise","Filters","Noise reduction","Speech coding","Speech synthesis","Quantization","Acoustic distortion","Signal synthesis","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","quantisation (signal)","speech coding","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech quality enhancement","speech coding","quantization noise","acoustic background noise","postfilter parameter","computational complexity","noise attenuation preprocessor","conventional postfilter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Additive noise","distortion measure","multiplicative noise","noise reduction","perceptually optimal processing","postfilter","speech coding","speech enhancement","tandeming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.909327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4407525/04378274.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4407525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.909327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Postfilter for Speech Quality Enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Postfilter for Speech Quality Enhancement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378274/","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378274/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10006836","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Postfilter for Speech Quality Enhancement","sourcePdf":"16tasl01-grancharov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137712S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4407525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4407525","articleId":"4378274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":4378276,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Ignacio Mulero-Martinez","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas y Autom\u00e1tica, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4447273/4378276/4378276-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juan Ignacio Mulero-Mart\u00ednez received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from University of Murcia (UM), Murcia, Spain, in 1995, and the B.Sc. degree (with first class honors) in automatic and electronic engineering, the M.Sc. degree in neurotechnology, control and robotics, and the European Ph.D. degree (summa cum laude) in control engineering from the from the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain, in 2000, 2003, and 2006, respectively.","Currently, he is a Lecturer of Industrial Engineering at the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena.

The class of functions to which this approach applies consists of those compactly supported in frequency. The approximative properties of uniqueness and existence are restricted to this class. Functions which are smooth enough can be expanded in Gaussian series converging uniformly to the objective function. The uniqueness of these series is demonstrated by the context of the orthonormal basis in a Hilbert space. Furthermore, the best approximation to a given band-limited function from a truncated Gaussian series is analyzed by an energy-based argument. This analysis not only gives a theoretical proof concerned with the existence of best approximations but addresses the problems of architectural selection. Specifically, guidance for selecting the variance and the oversampling parameters is provided for practitioners.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.905851","startPage":"284","endPage":"298","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4447273/04378276.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.905851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Best Approximation of Gaussian Neural Networks With Nodes Uniformly Spaced","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Frequency","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Kernel","Polynomials","Sampling methods","Hilbert space","Bandwidth","Radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","polynomial approximation","radial basis function networks","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian neural network","Gaussian radial basis function","Gaussian series","Hilbert space","energy-based argument","polynomial approximation","oversampling parameter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Best approximation","existence","functions band-limited in frequency","Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs)","sampling theory","truncation","uniqueness"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Simulation","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Normal Distribution","Pattern Recognition, Automated"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378276/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Best Approximation of Gaussian Neural Networks With Nodes Uniformly Spaced","volume":"19","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4378276/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","accessionNumber":"9801795","pubMedId":"18269959","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Best Approximation of Gaussian Neural Networks With Nodes Uniformly Spaced","sourcePdf":"19tnn02-muleromartinez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18995S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4447273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4447273","articleId":"4378276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378277,"authors":[{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4447273/4378277/4378277-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Derong Liu (S'91\u2013M'94\u2013SM'96\u2013F'05) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, in 1994.","From 1993 to 1995, he was a Staff Fellow with General Motors Research and Development Center, Warren, MI. from 1995 to 1999, he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ.

Such mental activity can be reflected by EEG energy. In particular, intrusion of EEG theta wave activity into the beta activity of active wakefulness has been interpreted as ensuing sleepiness. Pupil behavior can also provide information regarding alertness. This paper develops an innovative signal classification method that is capable of differentiating subjects with sleep disorders which cause excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) from normal control subjects who do not have a sleep disorder based on EEG and pupil size. Subjects with sleep disorders include persons with untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and narcolepsy. The Yoss pupil staging rule is used to scale levels of wakefulness and at the same time theta energy ratios are calculated from the same 2-s sliding windows by Fourier or wavelet transforms. Then, an artificial neural network (NN) of modified adaptive resonance theory (ART2) is utilized to identify the two groups within a combined group of subjects including those with OSA and healthy controls. This grouping from the NN is then compared with the actual diagnostic classification of subjects as OSA or controls and is found to be 91% accurate in differentiating between the two groups. The same algorithm results in 90% correct differentiation between narcoleptic and control subjects.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.908634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4447273/04378277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.908634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4447273","startPage":"308","endPage":"318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network Method for Detection of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Narcolepsy Based on Pupil Size and EEG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Method for Detection of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Narcolepsy Based on Pupil Size and EEG","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378277/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 February 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9794253","pubMedId":"18269961","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4378277/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Method for Detection of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Narcolepsy Based on Pupil Size and EEG","sourcePdf":"19tnn02-dliu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150101S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4447273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4447273","articleId":"4378277","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4378280,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Yilei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Yilei","id":"37298639900"},{"name":"Song Qing","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Qing","id":"37298640500"},{"name":"Liu Sheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37852097300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4378280","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Cost function","Robustness","Steady-state","Computer errors","Convergence","Neurons","Working environment noise","Statistical analysis","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","error analysis","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural networks","augmented error gradient","training error","normalized adaptive recurrent learning","steady-state response","training stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive learning rate","augmented error gradient","convergence","normalization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adaptation, Biological","Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Humans","Learning","Neural Networks (Computer)","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Time Factors"]}],"abstract":"For training algorithms of recurrent neural networks (RNN), convergent speed and training error are always two contradictory performances.

The state of these switches can be determined by applying logical reasoning. Thus, knowledge-based systems are ideal tools to accomplish the task. In this paper, an expert system is developed by utilizing its fast reasoning mechanism and object-oriented features. The feeder component and configuration data are organized in a hierarchy way using the object-oriented programming paradigm. On the other hand, facts are used for representing the information during inference process. Service restoration procedure proposed in this paper takes load variation into consideration. The simulation results indicate that more solutions can be obtained for service restoration problems when load variation is considered. Another unique property of the proposed system is that it is capable of proposing multiple restoration plans. Multiple plans are important for the system operators since the best solution proposed by the system may not be workable in reality. By proposing multiple plans, the system operator can choose a plan which is more suitable to the real situation for service restoration problems.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2007.907585","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4435940/04378288.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4435940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2007.907585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"219","endPage":"225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of an Object-Oriented Service Restoration Expert System With Load Variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Development of an Object-Oriented Service Restoration Expert System With Load Variations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378288/","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4378288/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748254","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of an Object-Oriented Service Restoration Expert System With Load Variations","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs01-tsai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051612S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4435940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4435940","articleId":"4378288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4378294,"authors":[{"name":"Yazi Cao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4387658/4378294/4378294-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yazi Cao received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, Hubei, China, in 2004, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at Wuhan University.","His research interests include RFIC design, modeling, and simulation."]},"firstName":"Yazi","lastName":"Cao","id":"37693479600"},{"name":"Gaofeng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics and Information Technology, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4387658/4378294/4378294-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Gaofeng Wang (S'93\u2013M'95\u2013SM'01) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in scientific computing from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2001.","From 1988 to 1990, he was with the Department of Space Physics, Wuhan University, Hubei, China.

The synthetic quasi-TEM TL, also called the complementary-conducting-strip transmission line (CCS TL), is composed of five structural parameters to synthesize its guiding characteristics. Twenty-four designs of CCS TL are reported, with the following unique attributes. First, a characteristic impedance range of 8.62-104.0 Omega is yielded. Second, the maximum value of the slow-wave factor is 4.79, representing an increase of 139.5% over the theoretical limit of the quasi-TEM TL. Third, the ratio of the area of the CCS TL to its corresponding quality factor ( factor) can help to estimate the cost of the loss for the circuit miniaturizations. Additionally, the important CMOS manufacturing of metal density is for the first time involved in the reported TL designs. By following the proposed design methodologies, a practical design example of a -band CMOS rat-race hybrid is reported and experimentally examined in detail to reveal the feasibility of the proposed design guidelines to synthesize the CMOS CCS TL. The chip size without contact pads is 420.0 mum 540.0 mum. The measured loss and isolation of the hybrid at 36.3 GHz are 3.84 and 58.0 dB, respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4387658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.910089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4387658/04378296.pdf","startPage":"2512","endPage":"2520","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.910089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Synthetic Quasi-TEM Transmission Line for CMOS Compact Integrated Circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Synthetic Quasi-TEM Transmission Line for CMOS Compact Integrated Circuit","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4378296/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9756894","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Synthetic Quasi-TEM Transmission Line for CMOS Compact Integrated Circuit","sourcePdf":"55tmtt12-chiang-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096541S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4387658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4387658","articleId":"4378296","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4378297,"authors":[{"name":"Majid El Kaamouchi","affiliation":["Microwave Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4387657/4378297/4378297-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Majid El Kaamouchi (S'06) was born in Berkane, Morocco, in 1978.

This was realized by vertically cascading substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavities. A single SIW cavity FSS has been fully studied and approximate analytical formulas are introduced to calculate its resonant frequencies. Two different resonances can be excited by a plane wave in the single SIW cavity FSS. According to theories of the cascading cavity filter and dual-mode filter, cross coupling can be realized in cascading SIW cavity FSSs, thus a compact FSS with a quasi-elliptic bandpass response is implemented. A Ka-band sample was fabricated by a printed circuit board (PCB) process. Experiments were carried out to validate this design method. Measured results are in agreement with predicted ones. The proposed quasi-elliptic FSS presents a number of advantages, namely, high selectivity, stable performance, and much reduced volume.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.910085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4387658/04378299.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.910085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4387658","startPage":"2481","endPage":"2487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Experimental Verification of Compact Frequency-Selective Surface With Quasi-Elliptic Bandpass Response","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Experimental Verification of Compact Frequency-Selective Surface With Quasi-Elliptic Bandpass Response","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 December 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9756901","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4378299/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Experimental Verification of Compact Frequency-Selective Surface With Quasi-Elliptic Bandpass Response","sourcePdf":"55tmtt12-luo-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095257S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4387658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4387658","articleId":"4378299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4378302,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Ethernet network interface controllers (NICs) in the US alone consume hundreds of millions of US dollars in electricity per year. Most Ethernet links are underutilized and link energy consumption can be reduced by operating at a lower data rate. In this paper, we investigate adaptive link rate (ALR) as a means of reducing the energy consumption of a typical Ethernet link by adaptively varying the link data rate in response to utilization. Policies to determine when to change the link data rate are studied. Simple policies that use output buffer queue length thresholds and fine-grain utilization monitoring are shown to be effective. A Markov model of a state-dependent service rate queue with rate transitions only at service completion is used to evaluate the performance of ALR with respect to the mean packet delay, the time spent in an energy-saving low link data rate, and the oscillation of link data rates. Simulation experiments using actual and synthetic traffic traces show that an Ethernet link with ALR can operate at a lower data rate for over 80 percent of the time, yielding significant energy savings with only a very small increase in packet delay.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.70836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.70836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4458216/04378356.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4458216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the Energy Consumption of Ethernet with Adaptive Link Rate (ALR)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the Energy Consumption of Ethernet with Adaptive Link Rate (ALR)","volume":"57","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9902619","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378356/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the Energy Consumption of Ethernet with Adaptive Link Rate (ALR)","sourcePdf":"ttc2008040448.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067618S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4458216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"293","xplore-issue":"4458216","articleId":"4378356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4378358,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Che","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Che","id":"37275722300"},{"name":"Zhijun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279246300"},{"name":"Kai Zheng","affiliation":["System Research Group, IBM China Resarch Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37276693400"},{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279241300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"4378358","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":637},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"abstract":"One of the most critical resource management issues in the use of ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) for packet classification/filtering is how to effectively support filtering rules with ranges, known as range matching. In this paper, the dynamic range encoding scheme (DRES) is proposed to significantly improve the TCAM storage efficiency for range matching. Unlike the existing range encoding schemes requiring additional hardware support, DRES uses the TCAM coprocessor itself to assist range encoding. Hence, DRES can be readily programmed in a network processor using a TCAM coprocessor for packet classification. A salient feature of DRES is its ability to allow a subset of ranges to be encoded and, hence, to have full control over the range code size. This advantage allows DRES to exploit the TCAM structure to maximize the TCAM storage efficiency. DRES is a comprehensive solution, including a dynamic range selection algorithm, a search key encoding scheme, a range encoding scheme, and a dynamic encoded range update algorithm. Although the dynamic range selection algorithm running in the software allows optimal selection of ranges to be encoded to fully utilize the TCAM storage, the dynamic encoded range update algorithm allows the TCAM database to be updated lock free without interrupting the TCAM database lookup process. DRES is evaluated based on real-world databases and the results show that DRES can reduce the TCAM storage expansion ratio from 6.20 to 1.23. The performance analysis of DRES based on a probabilistic model demonstrates that DRES significantly improves the TCAM storage efficiency for a wide spectrum of range distributions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4531171/04378358.pdf","startPage":"902","endPage":"915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2007.70838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2007.70838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4531171","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRES: Dynamic Range Encoding Scheme for TCAM Coprocessors","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","coprocessors","resource allocation","telecommunication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRES","dynamic range encoding","TCAM coprocessor","resource management","ternary content-addressable memory","packet classification","packet filtering","range matching","network processor","dynamic range selection","key encoding","dynamic encoded range update"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Associative memories","Composite structures","Storage/repositories","Network repositories/data mining/backup"]},{"kwd":["Associative memories","Composite structures","Storage/repositories","Network repositories/data mining/backup"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"DRES: Dynamic Range Encoding Scheme for TCAM Coprocessors","volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4378358/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10196166","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRES: Dynamic Range Encoding Scheme for TCAM Coprocessors","sourcePdf":"ttc2008070902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057129S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"4531171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"72","articleId":"4378358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4378368,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/4435108/4378368/4378368-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Huang received the BS degree in computer science from Beijing University, China, in 1997 and the MS degree from the University of California, Irvine, in 2003.

In the proposed scheme, the coding process is led by an iterative octree cell subdivision of the object space. At each level of subdivision, the positions of point samples are approximated by the geometry centers of all tree-front cells, whereas normals and colors are approximated by their statistical average within each of the tree-front cells. With this framework, we employ attribute-dependent encoding techniques to exploit the different characteristics of various attributes. All of these have led to a significant improvement in the rate-distortion (R-D) performance and a computational advantage over the state of the art. Furthermore, given sufficient levels of octree expansion, normal space partitioning, and resolution of color quantization, the proposed point cloud encoder can be potentially used for lossless coding of 3D point clouds.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2007.70441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/4435108/04378368.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2007.70441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4435108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generic Scheme for Progressive Point Cloud Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378368/","displayDocTitle":"A Generic Scheme for Progressive Point Cloud Coding","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2008","accessionNumber":"9901664","pubMedId":"18192721","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378368/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generic Scheme for Progressive Point Cloud Coding","sourcePdf":"ttg2008020440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097052S","chronDate":"March-April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4435108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4435108","articleId":"4378368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4378370,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando V.

This paper presents a novel multidimensional projection technique based on least square approximations. The approximations compute the coordinates of a set of projected points based on the coordinates of a reduced number of control points with defined geometry. We name the technique least square projections (LSP). From an initial projection of the control points, LSP defines the positioning of their neighboring points through a numerical solution that aims at preserving a similarity relationship between the points given by a metric in mD. In order to perform the projection, a small number of distance calculations are necessary, and no repositioning of the points is required to obtain a final solution with satisfactory precision. The results show the capability of the technique to form groups of points by degree of similarity in 2D. We illustrate that capability through its application to mapping collections of textual documents from varied sources, a strategic yet difficult application. LSP is faster and more accurate than other existing high-quality methods, particularly where it was mostly tested, that is, for mapping text sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378370/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May-June 2008","accessionNumber":"9913534","pubMedId":"18369264","htmlLink":"/document/4378370/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Least Square Projection: A Fast High-Precision Multidimensional Projection Technique and Its Application to Document Mapping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least Square Projection: A Fast High-Precision Multidimensional Projection Technique and Its Application to Document Mapping","sourcePdf":"ttg2008030564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125812S","chronDate":"May-June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4472702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"4472702","articleId":"4378370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378373,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4444333/4378373/4378373-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Chen received the BS degree in computer science and engineering from Tianjin University, China, in 1994, the MA degree from the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand, in 1997, and the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2005.

There are two important issues related to the similarity search, namely, the design of a distance function to measure the similarity and improving the search efficiency. Many distance functions have been proposed, which attempt to closely mimic human recognition. Unfortunately, some of these well-designed distance functions do not follow the triangle inequality and are therefore nonmetric. As a consequence, efficient retrieval by using these nonmetric distance functions becomes more challenging, since most existing index structures assume that the indexed distance functions are metric. In this paper, we address this challenging problem by proposing an efficient method, that is, local constant embedding (LCE), which divides the data set into disjoint groups so that the triangle inequality holds within each group by constant shifting. Furthermore, we design a pivot selection approach for the converted metric distance and create an index structure to speed up the retrieval efficiency. Moreover, we also propose a novel method to answer approximate similarity search in the nonmetric space with a guaranteed query accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method works well on various nonmetric distance functions and improves the retrieval efficiency by an order of magnitude compared to the linear scan and existing retrieval approaches with no false dismissals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378373/","volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4378373/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9836259","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Similarity Search in Nonmetric Spaces with Local Constant Embedding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Similarity Search in Nonmetric Spaces with Local Constant Embedding","sourcePdf":"ttk2008030321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172927S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4444333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4444333","articleId":"4378373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4378374,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Hyuk Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/4444333/4378374/4378374-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong-Hyuk Kim received the BS degree in computer science and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science and engineering from Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, in 1999, 2001, and 2005, respectively.

Unlike traditional text categorization methods, event analysis approaches consider the temporal relations among documents. However, such methods suffer from the threshold-dependency problem, so they only perform well for a narrow range of thresholds. In addition, if the contents of a document stream change, the optimal threshold (that is, the threshold that yields the best performance) often changes as well. In this paper, we propose a threshold-resilient online algorithm, called the incremental probabilistic latent semantic indexing (IPLSI) algorithm, which alleviates the threshold-dependency problem and simultaneously maintains the continuity of the latent semantics to better capture the story line development of events. The IPLSI algorithm is theoretically sound and empirically efficient and effective for event analysis. The results of the performance evaluation performed on the topic detection and tracking (TDT)-4 corpus show that the algorithm reduces the cost of event analysis by as much as 15 percent ~ 20 percent and increases the acceptable threshold range by 200 percent to 300 percent over the baseline.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9836257","htmlLink":"/document/4378375/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using Incremental PLSI for Threshold-Resilient Online Event Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Incremental PLSI for Threshold-Resilient Online Event Analysis","sourcePdf":"ttk2008030289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096642S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"4444333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4444333","articleId":"4378375","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":4378392,"authors":[{"name":"Tat-Jun Chin","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4567786/4378392/4378392-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tat-Jun Chin received the BEng degree in mechatronics engineering from the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) in 2003 and the PhD degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering (ECSE), Monash University, Victoria, Australia, in 2007.

The simplification of the image is then achieved by setting each segment of the partition to the mean value of the pixels falling within this segment. Fine to coarse partition hierarchies (and, therefore, images of increasing degree of simplification) are produced by varying the threshold value associated with each connectivity constraint.

Our work represents a departure from traditional models of speech recognition, where the end goal is to classify speech into categories defined by a prespecified inventory of lexical units (i.e., phones or words). Instead, we attempt to discover such an inventory in an unsupervised manner by exploiting the structure of repeating patterns within the speech signal. We show how pattern discovery can be used to automatically acquire lexical entities directly from an untranscribed audio stream. Our approach to unsupervised word acquisition utilizes a segmental variant of a widely used dynamic programming technique, which allows us to find matching acoustic patterns between spoken utterances. By aggregating information about these matching patterns across audio streams, we demonstrate how to group similar acoustic sequences together to form clusters corresponding to lexical entities such as words and short multiword phrases. On a corpus of academic lecture material, we demonstrate that clusters found using this technique exhibit high purity and that many of the corresponding lexical identities are relevant to the underlying audio stream.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Pattern Discovery in Speech","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.909282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4407525/04378402.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.909282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4407525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 December 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Pattern Discovery in Speech","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4378402/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10006844","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Pattern Discovery in Speech","sourcePdf":"16tasl01-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08735S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4407525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4407525","articleId":"4378402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378403,"authors":[{"name":"Filiberto Bilotti","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, University of Rome Tre, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4387657/4378403/4378403-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Filiberto Bilotti (S'97\u2013M'03\u2013SM'06) was born in Rome, Italy, on April 25, 1974.

The proposed models, derived in terms of equivalent circuits, represent an extension of the models presented in a recent publication. In particular, the extended models take into account the presence of a dielectric substrate hosting the metallic inclusions and the losses due to the finite conductivity of the conductors and the finite resistivity of the dielectrics. Exploiting these circuit models, it is possible to accurately predict not only the resonant frequency of the individual inclusions, but also their quality factor and the relative permeability of metamaterial samples made by given arrangements of such inclusions. Finally, the three models have been tested against full-wave simulations and measurements, showing a good accuracy. This result opens the door to a quick and accurate design of the artificial magnetic inclusions to fabricate real-life metamaterial samples with anomalous values of the permeability.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.909611","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4387657/04378403.pdf","startPage":"2865","endPage":"2873","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.909611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4387657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalent-Circuit Models for the Design of Metamaterials Based on Artificial Magnetic Inclusions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 December 2007","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent-Circuit Models for the Design of Metamaterials Based on Artificial Magnetic Inclusions","volume":"55","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2007","accessionNumber":"9883898","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4378403/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent-Circuit Models for the Design of Metamaterials Based on Artificial Magnetic Inclusions","sourcePdf":"55tmtt12-bilotti-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075784S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4387657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"4387657","articleId":"4378403","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":4378404,"authors":[{"name":"Usman A.

Numerical analysis shows that the GPIC algorithm can approximately achieve the MLD performance with considerably low and stable computational complexity. Furthermore, it can be significantly accelerated via parallel processing methods. With near-optimal performance, low and stable complexity, and high running speed, the GPIC algorithm is very suitable for real-time communication systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4407637/04378413.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.906774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.906774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4407637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Parallel Interference Cancellation With Near-Optimal Detection Performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Detection algorithms","Iterative algorithms","MIMO","Computational complexity","Iterative decoding","Maximum likelihood detection","Parallel processing","Real time systems","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","interference suppression","maximum likelihood detection","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized parallel interference cancellation","near-optimal detection performance","maximum-likelihood detection algorithm","vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time systems","parallel processing method","real-time communication system","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference cancellation","linear detection","maximum-likelihood detection","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","vertical Bell Laboratories layered space\u2013time (V-BLAST)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2007","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Parallel Interference Cancellation With Near-Optimal Detection Performance","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4378413/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9742685","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Parallel Interference Cancellation With Near-Optimal Detection Performance","sourcePdf":"56tsp01-luo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089124S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4407637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4407637","articleId":"4378413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4378415,"authors":[{"name":"Shahram Shahbazpanahi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Ontario, Oshawa, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4432769/4378415/4378415-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahram Shahbazpanahi (M'02) was born in Sanandaj, Kurdistan, Iran.

A new blind approach is proposed to jointly estimate the channel matrix and the CFO parameters using a relaxed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator that, for the sake of simplicity, ignores the finite alphabet constraint. Although the proposed technique can be applied to the majority of OSTBCs, there are, however, a few codes that suffer from an intrinsic ambiguity in the joint channel, CFO, and symbol estimates. For such specific OSTBCs, a semiblind modification of the proposed approach is developed that resolves the aforementioned estimation ambiguity. Our simulation results demonstrate that although the finite alphabet constraint is relaxed, the performance of the proposed techniques approaches that of the informed (fully frequency-synchronized and coherent) receiver, provided that a sufficient number of data blocks is available for each channel realization.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.906668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4432769/04378415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.906668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432769","startPage":"702","endPage":"711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind and Semiblind Channel and Carrier Frequency-Offset Estimation in Orthogonally Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind and Semiblind Channel and Carrier Frequency-Offset Estimation in Orthogonally Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748125","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4378415/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind and Semiblind Channel and Carrier Frequency-Offset Estimation in Orthogonally Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"56tsp02-shahbazpanahi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081376S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4432769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4432769","articleId":"4378415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4378416,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Jun Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4432769/4378416/4378416-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Jun Xiao (S'04\u2013M'07) received the B.

Due to power and bandwidth limitations, each sensor compresses its data in order to minimize the amount of information that needs to be communicated to the fusion center. In this context, we study the linear decentralized estimation of the source vector, where each sensor linearly encodes its observations and the fusion center also applies a linear mapping to estimate the unknown vector signal based on the received messages. We adopt the mean squared error (MSE) as the performance criterion. When the channels between sensors and the fusion center are orthogonal, it has been shown previously that the complexity of designing the optimal encoding matrices is NP-hard in general. In this paper, we study the optimal linear decentralized estimation when the multiple access channel (MAC) is coherent. For the case when the source and observations are scalars, we derive the optimal power scheduling via convex optimization and show that it admits a simple distributed implementation. Simulations show that the proposed power scheduling improves the MSE performance by a large margin when compared to the uniform power scheduling. We also show that under a finite network power budget, the asymptotic MSE performance (when the total number of sensors is large) critically depends on the multiple access scheme. For the case when the source and observations are vectors, we study the optimal linear decentralized estimation under both bandwidth and power constraints. We show that when the MAC between sensors and the fusion center is noiseless, the resulting problem has a closed-form solution (which is in sharp contrast to the orthogonal MAC case), while in the noisy MAC case, the problem can be efficiently solved by semidefinite programming (SDP).","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.906762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.906762","startPage":"757","endPage":"770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4432769/04378416.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Coherent Decentralized Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","displayDocTitle":"Linear Coherent Decentralized Estimation","volume":"56","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","accessionNumber":"9748135","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4378416/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Coherent Decentralized Estimation","sourcePdf":"56tsp02-xiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119814S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4432769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"192","xplore-issue":"4432769","articleId":"4378416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4378417,"authors":[{"name":"Magnus Mossberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Karlstad University, Karlstad, Sweden"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Mossberg","id":"37273283300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4378417","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"The problem of estimating the parameters in stochastic continuous-time signals, represented as continuous-time autoregressive moving average (ARMA) processes, from discrete-time data is considered.

Although many architectures are possible for IPTV video distribution, several mesh-pull P2P architectures have been successfully deployed on the Internet. In order to gain insights into mesh-pull P2P IPTV systems and the traffic loads they place on ISPs, we have undertaken an in-depth measurement study of one of the most popular IPTV systems, namely, PPLive. We have developed a dedicated PPLive crawler, which enables us to study the global characteristics of the mesh-pull PPLive system. We have also collected extensive packet traces for various different measurement scenarios, including both campus access networks and residential access networks. The measurement results obtained through these platforms bring important insights into P2P IPTV systems. Specifically, our results show the following. 1) P2P IPTV users have the similar viewing behaviors as regular TV users. 2) During its session, a peer exchanges video data dynamically with a large number of peers. 3) A small set of super peers act as video proxy and contribute significantly to video data uploading. 4) Users in the measured P2P IPTV system still suffer from long start-up delays and playback lags, ranging from several seconds to a couple of minutes. Insights obtained in this study will be valuable for the development and deployment of future P2P IPTV systems.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2007.907451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4378421/04378423.pdf","startPage":"1672","endPage":"1687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2007.907451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Measurement Study of a Large-Scale P2P IPTV System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378423/","displayDocTitle":"A Measurement Study of a Large-Scale P2P IPTV System","volume":"9","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9674212","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378423/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Measurement Study of a Large-Scale P2P IPTV System","sourcePdf":"09tmm08-hei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122441S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4378421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"478","xplore-issue":"4378421","articleId":"4378423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378436,"authors":[{"name":"Weisheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279192600"},{"name":"Junmin Li","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Junmin","lastName":"Li","id":"37279853400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"4378436","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":237,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":961},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Nonlinear control systems","Large-scale systems","Distributed control","Centralized control","Backstepping","Signal design","Neural networks","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","convergence","decentralised control","feedback","interconnected systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized output feedback neural control","adaptive backstepping control","large-scale nonlinear system","unknown interconnection","modeling error","closed-loop signal","tracking error","convergence","simulation","dynamical system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backstepping","decentralized control","large-scale systems","neural networks (NNs)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Models, Statistical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]},{"kwd":["Backstepping","decentralized control","large-scale systems","neural networks (NNs)"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive backstepping neural-network control approach is extended to a class of large-scale nonlinear output-feedback systems with completely unknown and mismatched interconnections. The novel contribution is to remove the common assumptions on interconnections such as matching condition, bounded by upper bounding functions. Differentiation of the interconnected signals in backstepping design is avoided by replacing the interconnected signals in neural inputs with the reference signals. Furthermore, two kinds of unknown modeling errors are handled by the adaptive technique. All the closed-loop signals are guaranteed to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking errors are proved to converge to a small residual set around the origin. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the control approach proposed in this correspondence.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2007.904544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4432675/04378436.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2007.904544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4432675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Output-Feedback Neural Control for Systems With Unknown Interconnections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 January 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378436/","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Output-Feedback Neural Control for Systems With Unknown Interconnections","volume":"38","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9748212","pubMedId":"18270097","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378436/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Output-Feedback Neural Control for Systems With Unknown Interconnections","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb01-chen2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09391S","chronDate":"Feb.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4432675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"237","xplore-issue":"4432675","articleId":"4378436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4378437,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tani","affiliation":["RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4432675/4378437/4378437-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Tani received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, the dual M.S. degree in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and the Dr. Eng. degree from Sophia University, Tokyo.","He was a Researcher with the Sony Computer Science Laboratory in 1990.

A humanoid robot, with a recurrent neural network that has a hierarchical structure, learns to manipulate objects. Robots learn tasks in repeated self-trials with the assistance of human interaction, which provides physical guidance until the tasks are mastered and learning is consolidated within the neural networks.

Discrete current switching, which is caused by a single trap, has been found to be almost one order of magnitude higher with respect to what was predicted by the classical theory of carrier number and correlated mobility fluctuations. Nevertheless, the trap signature well fits the typical SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n trap spectroscopy. In addition, the rigid shift between the transfer curves related to filled- and empty-trap state, together with the normalized current fluctuation dependence on the channel carrier density, suggests that a pure number fluctuation is the correct theoretical interpretative framework. Thus, we propose a possible physical explanation for such a giant RTS on the basis of a quasi-1-D current filamentation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378483/","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9671809","volume":"28","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Giant Random Telegraph Signals in Nanoscale Floating-Gate Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Giant Random Telegraph Signals in Nanoscale Floating-Gate Devices","sourcePdf":"28led12-fantini.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042091S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"4383529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4383529","articleId":"4378483","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378490,"authors":[{"name":"Amir K.

A symbol-based turbo code acting on symbols of size 4 is used to select a coset along each 1D subconstellation (using the partition Z/4Z). The proposed coset coding method satisfies the conditions for the separability of shaping and coding, and, consequently, can be easily integrated with the shaping algorithm. Numerical results are presented for an additive white Gaussian noise channel. The proposed coding-shaping algorithm offers the best performance reported in the literature, enjoys very low complexity, can be easily scaled to accommodate different bit rates and spectral efficiencies, and does not suffer from an early error floor, as observed in many other related works.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Shaping Technique With Turbo Coset Codes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.898417","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4378488/04378490.pdf","startPage":"3770","endPage":"3779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.898417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378490/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Application of Shaping Technique With Turbo Coset Codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4378490/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9674241","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Shaping Technique With Turbo Coset Codes","sourcePdf":"56tvt06-khandani-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107757S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4378488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4378488","articleId":"4378490","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378492,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Parker","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4378487/4378492/4378492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ryan Parker received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 2005 and the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2006, where he studied wireless ad hoc vehicle networks.","From 2005 to 2006, he was a member of the Communications Group, University of Toronto.

These devices use the IEEE 802.11p standard to support low-latency vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. However, a major challenge for the cooperative collision warning is to accurately determine the location of vehicles. In this paper, we present a novel cooperative-vehicle-position-estimation algorithm which can achieve a higher accuracy and more reliability than the existing global-positioning-system-based positioning solutions by making use of intervehicle-distance measurements taken by a radio-ranging technique. Our algorithm uses signal-strength-based intervehicle-distance measurements, vehicle kinematics, and road maps to estimate the relative positions of vehicles in a cluster. We have analyzed our algorithm by examining its performance-bound, computational-complexity, and communication-overhead requirements. In addition, we have shown that the accuracy of our algorithm is superior to previously proposed localization algorithms.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4378487/04378492.pdf","startPage":"3371","endPage":"3380","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.907687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.907687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicular Node Localization Using Received-Signal-Strength Indicator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378492/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Vehicular Node Localization Using Received-Signal-Strength Indicator","htmlLink":"/document/4378492/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9671781","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicular Node Localization Using Received-Signal-Strength Indicator","sourcePdf":"56tvt06-parker-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075408S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4378487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"4378487","articleId":"4378492","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4378493,"authors":[{"name":"Nghi H.

On the radio link layer three TCP error control strategies are evaluated and compared. The first strategy is based on the radio-link-protocol (RLP), which breaks down the TCP packets into smaller blocks and uses an error detecting procedure to protect those RLP blocks. The second strategy uses forward-error-control (FEC) procedure at the radio link layer. In this case, two kinds of FEC are compared: convolutional and turbo coding. The third one is a hybrid between the first and second strategies with coding at the RLP layer.

In the first stage of the algorithm, the background classes, which are the dominant classes in the image, are found. The method consists of robust clustering of a randomly chosen small percentage of the image pixels. The clusters are the representatives of the background classes. By using a subset of the pixels instead of the whole image, the computation is sped up, and the probability of including outliers in the background model is reduced. Anomalous pixels are the pixels with spectra that have large relative distances from the cluster centers. Several clustering techniques are investigated, and experimental results using realistic hyperspectral data are presented. A self-organizing map clustered using the local minima of the U-matrix (unified distance matrix) is identified as the most reliable method for background class extraction. The proposed algorithm for anomaly detection is evaluated using realistic hyperspectral data, is compared with a state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithm, and is shown to perform significantly better.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Time-Efficient Method for Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.909205","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4378533/04378536.pdf","startPage":"3894","endPage":"3904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.909205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Time-Efficient Method for Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4378536/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671755","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Time-Efficient Method for Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Images","sourcePdf":"45tgrs12-duran-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095479S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4378533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4378533","articleId":"4378536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4378541,"authors":[{"name":"Roman M.

The proposed method consists of multiscale isotropic matched filtering using a nonlinear image operator optimized for object detection and recognition. The method provides a robust scale- and orientation-invariant localization of the objects of interest. The local maxima of the matched-filtering operator are located at the potential centers of the objects of interest such as the trees. The tree verification stage consists of feature extraction at the candidate tree locations and comparison with the feature reference values. Experimental examples of the application of this matched-filtering method to LiDAR images of dense forest stands and sparsely distributed trees in residential areas are provided.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.908875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"3944","endPage":"3956","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.908875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378533","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4378533/04378541.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Filtering","Laser radar","Object detection","Remote sensing","Image sensors","Surface morphology","Digital elevation models","Image segmentation","Vegetation mapping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","forestry","geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","matched filters","object detection","optical radar","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale isotropic matched filtering","individual tree detection","lidar image","automated tree detection","remote sensing imagery","light detection and ranging","lidar height data","optimized nonlinear image operator","object detection","object recognition","tree verification stage","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital surface model (DSM)","digital terrain model (DTM)","feature estimation","forest segmentation","light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data","local scale","multiscale isotropic matched filtering (MIMF)","remote sensing","tree detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Isotropic Matched Filtering for Individual Tree Detection in LiDAR Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378541/","volume":"45","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4378541/","accessionNumber":"9674170","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Isotropic Matched Filtering for Individual Tree Detection in LiDAR Images","sourcePdf":"45tgrs12-palenichka-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100956S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4378533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4378533","articleId":"4378541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4378543,"authors":[{"name":"Qiyao Yu","affiliation":["Eutrovision, Inc., Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4378533/4378543/4378543-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiyao Yu received the B.A.Sc. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1997, the M.A.Sc. degree from the Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NF, Canada, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in systems design engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2006.","He is currently with Eutrovision Inc., Shanghai, China.

A computer-assisted analysis of SAR sea-ice imagery is extremely difficult due to numerous imaging parameters and environmental factors. This paper presents a system which, with some limited information provided, is able to perform an automated segmentation and classification for the SAR sea-ice imagery. In the system, both the segmentation and classification processes are based on a Markov random-field theory and are formulated in a joint manner under the Bayesian framework. Solutions to the formulation are obtained by a region-growing technique which keeps refining the segmentation and producing semantic class labels at the same time in an iterative manner. The algorithm is a general-segmentation approach named iterative region growing using semantics, which, in this paper, is dedicated to the problem of classifying the operational SAR sea-ice imagery provided by the Canadian Ice Service (CIS). The classified image results have been validated by the CIS personnel, and the resulting classifications are quite successful using the same algorithm applied to diverse data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.908876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378533","startPage":"3919","endPage":"3931","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4378533/04378543.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.908876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR Sea-Ice Image Analysis Based on Iterative Region Growing Using Semantics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sea ice","Image analysis","Image segmentation","Iterative algorithms","Computational Intelligence Society","Synthetic aperture radar","Computerized monitoring","Environmental factors","Bayesian methods","Refining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","oceanographic techniques","remote sensing by radar","sea ice","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","sea-ice image analysis","iterative region growing technique","polar regions","sea-ice monitoring","automated segmentation","Markov random-field theory","Bayesian framework","Canadian Ice Service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Expert system","image segmentation","Markov random field (MRF)","region growing","sea ice","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","displayDocTitle":"SAR Sea-Ice Image Analysis Based on Iterative Region Growing Using Semantics","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4378543/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9671758","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR Sea-Ice Image Analysis Based on Iterative Region Growing Using Semantics","sourcePdf":"45tgrs12-yu-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103423S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4378533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4378533","articleId":"4378543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4378544,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Zhong","affiliation":["ATR National Laboratory, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4378533/4378544/4378544-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ping Zhong received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics in 2001 and 2003, respectively, from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the ATR National Laboratory, School of Electronic Science and Engineering.","His research interests include image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition."]},"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37289138300"},{"name":"Runsheng Wang","affiliation":["ATR National Laboratory, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4378533/4378544/4378544-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Runsheng Wang graduated from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1964.","From January 1984 to June 1986 and from October 1992 to April 1993, he was a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

It demonstrates that multiple features should be utilized to characterize urban areas. On the other hand, since levels of development in neighboring areas are not statistically independent, the features of each urban area site depend on those of neighboring sites. In this paper, we present a multiple conditional random fields (CRFs) ensemble model to incorporate multiple features and learn their contextual information. This model involves two aspects: one is to use a CRF as the base classifier to automatically generate a set of CRFs by changing input features, and the other is to integrate the set of CRFs by defining a conditional distribution. The model has some distinct merits: each CRF component models a kind of feature, so that the ensemble model can learn different aspects of training data. Moreover, it lets the ensemble model search in a wide solution space. The ensemble model can also avoid the well-known overfitting problem of a single CRF, i.e., the many features may cause the redundancy of irrelevant information and result in counter-effect. Experiments on a wide range of images show that our ensemble model produces higher detection accuracy than single CRF and is also competitive with recent results in urban area detection.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.907109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4378533/04378544.pdf","startPage":"3978","endPage":"3988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.907109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiple Conditional Random Fields Ensemble Model for Urban Area Detection in Remote Sensing Optical Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378544/","displayDocTitle":"A Multiple Conditional Random Fields Ensemble Model for Urban Area Detection in Remote Sensing Optical Images","volume":"45","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671759","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378544/","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiple Conditional Random Fields Ensemble Model for Urban Area Detection in Remote Sensing Optical Images","sourcePdf":"45tgrs12-zhong-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092259S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4378533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"4378533","articleId":"4378544","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":4378547,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Langheinrich","affiliation":["Institute of Pervasive Computing, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/4383011/4378547/4378547-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marc Langheinrich received the M.S. degree (dipl.-inf.) in computer science from the University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany, in 1997, and the Ph.D. (Dr. sci.) degree in the areas of ubiquitous computing and privacy from the ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2005.","He is a Senior Researcher with the Institute for Pervasive Computing, the ETH Zurich.

Virtually all proposed privacy mechanisms so far require consumers to actively and explicitly protect read access to their tagged items-either by jamming rogue readers or by encrypting or pseudonymizing their tags. While this approach might work well for activists and highly concerned individuals, it is unlikely (and rather undesirable) that the average consumer should be outfitted with RFID jamming devices before stepping outside, or that anyone would bother pseudonymizing every can of soda they buy with a personal PIN code. Juels' ldquominimalist cryptographyrdquo offers a simple, yet effective, identification and tracking protection based on simple ID rotation, but it requires that the corresponding mappings (i.e., from pseudonyms to real IDs) are electronically exchanged whenever a product changes hands (e.g., for buying a pack of chewing gum at a kiosk)-a rather impractical requirement. Our work extends Juels' concept in order to alleviate the need for passing ID mapping tables. Using carefully assembled sets of IDs based on the cryptographic principle of secret shares, we can create RFID tags that yield virtually no information to casual ldquohit-and-runrdquo attackers, but only reveal their true ID after continuous and undisturbed reading from up-close-something that can hardly go unnoticed by an item's owner. This paper introduces the underlying mechanism of our extension to Juels' proposal, called ldquoShamir Tag,rdquo analyzes its tracking resistance and identification performance, and discusses deployment aspects.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4383011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/4383011/04378547.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2007.907683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2007.907683","startPage":"115","endPage":"128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Minimalist Cryptography for RFID Privacy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378547/","displayDocTitle":"Practical Minimalist Cryptography for RFID Privacy","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378547/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"9872711","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Minimalist Cryptography for RFID Privacy","sourcePdf":"01jsyst02-langheinrich.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065535S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"4383011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4383011","articleId":"4378547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4378554,"authors":[{"name":"Dusan Gleich","affiliation":["Laboratory for Signal Processing and Remote Control, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Dusan","lastName":"Gleich","id":"37063718500"},{"name":"Mihai Datcu","affiliation":["German AeroSpace Center (DLR), Remote Sensing Technology Institute, Wessling, Germany","Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Mihai","lastName":"Datcu","id":"37265637100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0196-2892"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0644"}],"articleNumber":"4378554","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":605},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gaussian processes","Additive noise","Gaussian distribution","Parameter estimation","Gaussian noise","Wavelet domain","Wavelet coefficients","Testing","Synthetic aperture radar","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","image denoising","synthetic aperture radar","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet-based speckle-removing algorithm","dyadic wavelet transform","additive signal-dependent noise","Gaussian distribution","noise-free images","generalized Gauss-Markov random field","GGMRF","unsupervised stochastic model-based approach","image denoising","expectation-maximization algorithm","noisy images","SAR images","synthetic aperture radar images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian inference","denoising","Gauss\u2013Markov random fields (GMRFs)","speckle noise","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a wavelet-based speckle-removing algorithm is represented and tested on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.

The method yields both a discrete cloud mask and a cloud-abundance product from MERIS level-1b data on a per-pixel basis. The cloud-screening method relies on the extraction of meaningful physical features (e.g., brightness and whiteness), which are combined with atmospheric-absorption features at specific MERIS-band locations (oxygen and water-vapor absorptions) to increase the cloud-detection accuracy. All these features are inputs to an unsupervised classification algorithm; the cloud-probability output is then combined with a spectral unmixing procedure to provide a cloud-abundance product instead of binary flags. The method is conceived to be robust and applicable to a broad range of actual situations with high variability of cloud types, presence of ground covers with bright and white spectra, and changing illumination conditions or observation geometry. The presented method has been shown to outperform the MERIS level-2 cloud flag in critical cloud-screening situations, such as over ice/snow covers and around cloud borders. The proposed modular methodology constitutes a general framework that can be applied to multispectral images acquired by spaceborne sensors working in the visible and near-infrared spectral range with proper spectral information to characterize atmospheric-oxygen and water-vapor absorptions.","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4378550/04378555.pdf","startPage":"4105","endPage":"4118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.905312","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.905312","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378555","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multispectral imaging","Clouds","MERIS","Instruments","Satellites","Data mining","Brightness","Absorption","Classification algorithms","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric composition","atmospheric humidity","atmospheric spectra","atmospheric techniques","clouds","feature extraction","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud-screening algorithm","multispectral images","Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer","MERIS instrument","Environmental Satellite","ENVISAT","discrete cloud mask","cloud-abundance product","physical features extraction","unsupervised classification algorithm","cloud-probability output","spectral unmixing procedure","cloud types","ground covers","bright spectra","white spectra","ice covers","spaceborne sensors","atmospheric-oxygen absorptions","atmospheric water-vapor absorptions","snow covers","visible spectral range","near-infrared spectral image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud screening","Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS)","multispectral images","spectral unmixing","unsupervised classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cloud-Screening Algorithm for ENVISAT/MERIS Multispectral Images","accessionNumber":"9671750","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4378555/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud-Screening Algorithm for ENVISAT/MERIS Multispectral Images","sourcePdf":"45tgrs12-gomezchova-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102096S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4378550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4378550","articleId":"4378555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4378565,"authors":[{"name":"Liangpei Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4378550/4378565/4378565-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liangpei Zhang (M'06) received the B.S. degree in physics from Hunan Normal University, ChangSha, China, in 1982, the M.S. degree in optics from the Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, China, in 1988, and the Ph.D. degree in photogrammetry and remote sensing from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1998.","From 1997 to 2000, he was a Professor with the School of the Land Sciences, Wuhan University.

The clonal selection theory is employed to describe the basic features of an immune response to an antigenic stimulus in order to meet the requirement of diversity in the antibody population. In our proposed strategy, dimensionality reduction is formulated as an optimization problem that searches an optimum with less number of features in a feature space. In line with this novel strategy, a feature subset search algorithm, clonal selection Feature-Selection (CSFS) algorithm, and a feature-weighting algorithm, Clonal-Selection Feature-Weighting (CSFW) algorithm, have been developed. In the CSFS, each solution is evolved in binary space, and the value of each bit is either 0 or 1, which indicates that the corresponding feature is either removed or selected, respectively. In CSFW, each antibody is directly represented by a string consisting of integer numbers and their corresponding weights. These algorithms are compared with the following four well-known algorithms: sequential forward selection, sequential forward floating selection, genetic-algorithm-based feature selection, and decision-boundary feature extraction using the hyperspectral remote-sensing imagery acquired by the Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager and the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that CSFS and CSFW outperform other algorithms and hence provide effective new options for dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral remote-sensing imagery.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.905311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.905311","endPage":"4186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4378550/04378565.pdf","startPage":"4172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dimensionality Reduction Based on Clonal Selection for Hyperspectral Imagery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378565/","displayDocTitle":"Dimensionality Reduction Based on Clonal Selection for Hyperspectral Imagery","volume":"45","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"9671753","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4378565/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dimensionality Reduction Based on Clonal Selection for Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"45tgrs12-zhang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097643S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4378550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"4378550","articleId":"4378565","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378569,"authors":[{"name":"Geert Van Meerbergen","affiliation":["ESAT Laboratory, Electrical Engineering Department, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Van Meerbergen","id":"37285040500"},{"name":"Marc Moonen","affiliation":["ESAT Laboratory, Electrical Engineering Department, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moonen","id":"37274397700"},{"name":"Hugo De Man","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium","ESAT Laboratory, Electrical Engineering Department, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"De Man","id":"37275981200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4378569","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, which are the most widespread classical error correcting codes. Recently, we have shown that an finite-impulse response (FIR) critically subsampled filterbank representation can be derived for some RS codes. However, this work only addresses RS codes with a non-coprime codeword and dataword length, seriously limiting its practical usability. In this paper, an alternative purely algebraic method is presented to construct such a filterbank. Apart from providing additional insight into the algebraic structure of (non-systematic) RS codes, this method is suited to eliminate the non-coprimeness constraint mentioned before. Using this filterbank decomposition, a RS code is broken into smaller subcodes that can subsequently be used to build a soft-in soft-out (SISO) RS decoder. It is shown how any RS code, written as an FIR filterbank, can be SISO decoded using the filterbank based decoder. Owing to the importance of systematic RS codes, it is shown that any systematic RS code can be decoded using the FIR filterbank decomposition. This leads to better decoding performance in addition with a slightly lower complexity. A further extension towards systematic RS codes is also presented in this paper resulting in an infinite-impulse response critically subsampled filterbank representation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4378566/04378569.pdf","startPage":"5681","endPage":"5694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.898777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.898777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filterbank Decompositions for (Non)-Systematic Reed\u2013Solomon Codes With Applications to Soft Decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Decoding","Finite impulse response filter","Redundancy","Error correction codes","Laboratories","OFDM modulation","Error correction","Usability","Source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","decoding","error correction codes","FIR filters","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filterbank decomposition","nonsystematic Reed-Solomon codes","soft decoding","error correcting codes","noncoprime codeword","dataword length","algebraic method","soft-in soft-out RS decoder","FIR filterbank"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Critical subsampling","filterbanks","Reed\u2013Solomon (RS) codes","soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"Filterbank Decompositions for (Non)-Systematic Reed\u2013Solomon Codes With Applications to Soft Decoding","volume":"55","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9671719","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filterbank Decompositions for (Non)-Systematic Reed\u2013Solomon Codes With Applications to Soft Decoding","sourcePdf":"55tsp12-vanmeerbergen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033883S","chronDate":"Dec.  2007","isNumber":"4378566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4378569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378666,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for word segmentation in historical and degraded machine-printed documents. The proposed technique faces problems such as having text of different size, having text and non-text areas lying very near and having non-straight and warped text lines. It is based on: (i) a dynamic run length smoothing algorithm that helps grouping together homogeneous text regions, (ii) noise and punctuation marks removal as well as on obstacle detection in order to facilitate the segmentation process and (iv) a draft text line estimation procedure that guides the final word segmentation result. After testing on numerous historical and degraded machine-printed documents, it has turned out that our methodology performs better compared to current state-of-the-art word segmentation techniques for historical and degraded machine-printed documents.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.2007.4378699","publicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4376968/4378655/04378699.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2007.4378699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Word Segmentation Technique for Historical and Degraded Machine-Printed Documents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378699/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Word Segmentation Technique for Historical and Degraded Machine-Printed Documents","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9869855","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378699/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Word Segmentation Technique for Historical and Degraded Machine-Printed Documents","confLoc":"Curitiba, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28220178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112881S","chronDate":"23-26 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4376968","isNumber":"4378655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4376968","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4378655","articleId":"4378699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4378712,"authors":[{"name":"Ch.

To yield good rate-distortion performance under strict complexity/time constraints for instance in real-time communication, a framework for optimal complexity allocation at the macroblock level is necessary. We developed a macroblock level fast motion estimation based complexity scalable motion/mode search algorithm where the complexity is adapted jointly by parameters that determine the aggressiveness of an early stop criteria, the number of ordered modes searched, and the accuracy of motion estimation steps for the INTER modes. Next, these complexity parameters are adapted per macroblock based on a control loop to approximately satisfy an encoding frame rate target. The optimal manner of adapting the parameters is derived from prior training. Results using the developed scalable complexity H.264/AVC encoder demonstrate the benefit of adaptive complexity allocation over uniform complexity scaling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378895/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","volume":"1","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9806862","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4378895/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Complexity Control for Real-Time Video Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity Control for Real-Time Video Coding","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-1-31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044697S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4378864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4378864","articleId":"4378895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4378926,"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Merkle","affiliation":["Image Processing Department, Fraunhofer Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Merkle","id":"37281805100"},{"name":"Aljoscha Smolic","affiliation":["Image Processing Department, Fraunhofer Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Aljoscha","lastName":"Smolic","id":"37281804900"},{"name":"Karsten Muller","affiliation":["Image Processing Department, Fraunhofer Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Muller","id":"37287291900"},{"name":"Thomas Wiegand","affiliation":["Image Processing Department, Fraunhofer Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Wiegand","id":"37274110200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4378926","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":239,"citationCountPatent":65,"totalDownloads":2887},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video compression","Rendering (computer graphics)","Video sequences","Three dimensional TV","Video coding","PSNR","Image color analysis","Image quality","Image analysis","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image representation","image sequences","statistical analysis","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth coding","multiview video sequences","3D representation","3D television","video coding","statistical dependencies","color prediction","PSNR","video plus depth representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-view video coding","video plus depth format","free viewpoint video","3DTV","point-based rendering"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-View Video Plus Depth Representation and Coding","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378864","endPage":"I - 204","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4378864/04378926.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378926","startPage":"I - 201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378926","abstract":"A study on the video plus depth representation for multi-view video sequences is presented. Such a 3D representation enables functionalities like 3D television and free viewpoint video. Compression is based on algorithms for multi-view video coding, which exploit statistical dependencies from both temporal and inter-view reference pictures for prediction of both color and depth data. Coding efficiency of prediction structures with and without inter-view reference pictures is analyzed for multi-view video plus depth data, reporting gains in luma PSNR of up to 0.5 dB for depth and 0.3 dB for color. The main benefit from using a multi-view video plus depth representation is that intermediate views can be easily rendered. Therefore the impact on image quality of rendered arbitrary intermediate views is investigated and analyzed in a second part, comparing compressed multi-view video plus depth data at different bit rates with the uncompressed original.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9820433","htmlLink":"/document/4378926/","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Multi-View Video Plus Depth Representation and Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-View Video Plus Depth Representation and Coding","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-1-62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133716S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4378864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"239","xplore-issue":"4378864","articleId":"4378926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":4378949,"authors":[{"name":"Rick Chartrand","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Rick","lastName":"Chartrand","id":"37659704100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4378949","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378949","abstract":"We show that using a nonconvex penalty term to regularize image reconstruction can substantially improve the preservation of object shapes.

For each image block in each channel, a 3D array is formed by stacking together blocks similar to it, a process that we call \"grouping\". The high similarity between grouped blocks in each 3D array enables a highly sparse representation of the true signal in a 3D transform domain and thus a subsequent shrinkage of the transform spectra results in effective noise attenuation. The peculiarity of the proposed method is the application of a \"grouping constraint\" on the chrominances by reusing exactly the same grouping as for the luminance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed grouping constraint and show that the developed denoising algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and visual quality.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378954","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4378864/04378954.pdf","startPage":"I - 313","endPage":"I - 316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Image Denoising via Sparse 3D Collaborative Filtering with Grouping Constraint in Luminance-Chrominance Space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Color Image Denoising via Sparse 3D Collaborative Filtering with Grouping Constraint in Luminance-Chrominance Space","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9811987","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4378954/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378954/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Image Denoising via Sparse 3D Collaborative Filtering with Grouping Constraint in Luminance-Chrominance Space","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-1-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04928S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4378864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"4378864","articleId":"4378954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4378975,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Therefore, proving the authenticity and integrity of digital media becomes increasingly important. In this work, we propose a simple method to detect image tampering operations that involve sharpness/blurriness adjustment. Our approach is based on the assumption that if a digital image undergoes a copy-paste type of forgery, average sharpness/blurriness value of the forged region is expected to be different as compared to the non-tampered parts of the image. The method of estimating sharpness/blurriness value of an image is based on the regularity properties of wavelet transform coefficients which involves measuring the decay of wavelet transform coefficients across scales. Our preliminary results show that the estimated sharpness/blurriness scores can be used to identify tampered areas of the image.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378975","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4378864/04378975.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378864","startPage":"I - 397","endPage":"I - 400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tamper Detection Based on Regularity of Wavelet Transform Coefficients","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tamper Detection Based on Regularity of Wavelet Transform Coefficients","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378975/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820471","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4378975/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tamper Detection Based on Regularity of Wavelet Transform Coefficients","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-1-111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.185244S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4378864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4378864","articleId":"4378975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4378985,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Munteanu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO)-Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology (IBBT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Munteanu","id":"37273656100"},{"name":"Oana Maria Surdu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO)-Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology (IBBT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Oana Maria","lastName":"Surdu","id":"37949782400"},{"name":"Jan Cornelis","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO)-Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology (IBBT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Cornelis","id":"37273649200"},{"name":"Peter Schelkens","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics (ETRO)-Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology (IBBT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Schelkens","id":"37273637200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4378985","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel segmentation-driven direction-adaptive discrete wavelet transform (SD DADWT), wherein the adaptation of the directional wavelet bases is performed on the segments describing the natural geometry of the image. First, a multi-resolution segmentation of the image is performed, obtained through an Edgmentation procedure. The optimum lifting directions are then selected for each segment and at each resolution. The proposed SD DADWT retains the inherent advantages offered by a multiresolution representation of the geometric features in the image, and in the same time provides a sparse image representation via DADWT. Preliminary experimental results obtained in a coding application show that the visual quality of the reconstructed image can be further improved by applying a geometrically-oriented transform on segments that approximate the natural borders in the image.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4378864/04378985.pdf","startPage":"I - 437","endPage":"I - 440","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segmentation-Driven Direction-Adaptive Discrete Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Image segmentation","Image coding","Image resolution","Signal resolution","Image representation","Multiresolution analysis","Spatial resolution","Discrete transforms","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","geometry","image coding","image reconstruction","image representation","image resolution","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["segmentation-driven DADWT","direction-adaptive discrete wavelet transform","multiresolution image segmentation","edgmentation procedure","image representation","geometrically-oriented transform","image coding","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive wavelets","scalable image coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation-Driven Direction-Adaptive Discrete Wavelet Transform","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4378985/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820481","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation-Driven Direction-Adaptive Discrete Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-1-121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077303S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4378864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4378864","articleId":"4378985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4378987,"authors":[{"name":"Yinji Piao","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yinji","lastName":"Piao","id":"37294283700"},{"name":"ll-hong Shin","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"ll-hong","lastName":"Shin","id":"37970236900"},{"name":"HyunWook Park","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"HyunWook","lastName":"Park","id":"37290673100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4378987","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":624},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Wavelet domain","Frequency estimation","Discrete wavelet transforms","Interpolation","Wavelet transforms","Image sampling","Filter bank","Decoding","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","discrete wavelet transforms","filtering theory","image enhancement","image resolution","image sampling","interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution enhancement","inter-subband correlation","wavelet domain analysis","high-frequency band information","sampling phase","DWT","interpolation filters","wavelet-based method","peak signal-to-noise-ratio","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image resolution","Image enhancement"]}],"abstract":"Wavelet-based resolution enhancement methods improve the image resolution by estimating the high-frequency band information.

In addition, there is no need to divide the input video sequence into group of frames, and it can be applied in a continuous manner, so that coding efficiency is increased and no blocking artifacts appear.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378993","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4378864/04378993.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378864","startPage":"I - 469","endPage":"I - 472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Frame-by-Frame Wavelet Transform Algorithm for a Three-Dimensional Analysis with Reduced Memory Usage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4378993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A General Frame-by-Frame Wavelet Transform Algorithm for a Three-Dimensional Analysis with Reduced Memory Usage","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378993/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820487","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4378993/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Frame-by-Frame Wavelet Transform Algorithm for a Three-Dimensional Analysis with Reduced Memory Usage","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-1-129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083514S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4378864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4378864","articleId":"4378993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4378995,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The region of support for global motion representation consists of the entire image frame. Therefore, estimating global motion parameters tends to be computationally costly due to the involvement of all the pixels in the calculation. Efficient global motion estimation (GME) techniques are sought after in many applications such as video coding, image stabilization and super-resolution. In this paper, we propose to select only a small subset of the pixels in estimating the global motion parameters, based on a combination of fixed and random subsampling patterns. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method was able to speed up the conventional all-pixel GME approach by up to 7 times, without significant loss in the estimation accuracy. The combined subsampling patterns were also found to provide better motion estimation accuracy/complexity tradeoffs than those achievable by using either fixed or random patterns alone.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4378995","startPage":"I - 477","endPage":"I - 480","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4378864/04378995.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Global Motion Estimation using Fixed and Random Subsampling Patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Global Motion Estimation using Fixed and Random Subsampling Patterns","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4378995/","accessionNumber":"9820488","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4378995/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Global Motion Estimation using Fixed and Random Subsampling Patterns","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-1-131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041011S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4378864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4378864","articleId":"4378995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4379013,"authors":[{"name":"Karen Egiazarian","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Karen","lastName":"Egiazarian","id":"37267440500"},{"name":"Alessandro Foi","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Foi","id":"37294575400"},{"name":"Vladimir Katkovnik","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Katkovnik","id":"37284996400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379013","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1582},"abstract":"We introduce a new approach to image reconstruction from highly incomplete data. The available data are assumed to be a small collection of spectral coefficients of an arbitrary linear transform. This reconstruction problem is the subject of intensive study in the recent field of \"compressed sensing\" (also known as \"compressive sampling\"). Our approach is based on a quite specific recursive filtering procedure. At every iteration the algorithm is excited by injection of random noise in the unobserved portion of the spectrum and a spatially adaptive image denoising filter, working in the image domain, is exploited to attenuate the noise and reveal new features and details out of the incomplete and degraded observations. This recursive algorithm can be interpreted as a special type of the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation procedure with regularization enabled by a spatially adaptive filter. Overall, we replace the conventional parametric modeling used in CS by a nonparametric one. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for two important inverse problems from computerized tomography: Radon inversion from sparse projections and limited-angle tomography. In particular we show that the algorithm allows to achieve exact reconstruction of synthetic phantom data even from a very small number projections. The accuracy of our reconstruction is in line with the best results in the compressed sensing field.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4378864/04379013.pdf","startPage":"I - 549","endPage":"I - 552","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4378864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing Image Reconstruction Via Recursive Spatially Adaptive Filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Adaptive filters","Image coding","Image sampling","Filtering","Image denoising","Degradation","Approximation algorithms","Stochastic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","approximation theory","data compression","image coding","image denoising","image reconstruction","image sampling","iterative methods","random noise","recursive filters","spatial filters","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image compression","recursive spatially adaptive image denoising filter","arbitrary linear transform","compressive sampling","random noise injection","Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation procedure","inverse problem","computerized tomography","Radon inversion","synthetic phantom data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","sparsity","inverse problems","Radon transform","limited-angle tomography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing Image Reconstruction Via Recursive Spatially Adaptive Filtering","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4379013/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820502","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing Image Reconstruction Via Recursive Spatially Adaptive Filtering","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-1-149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077833S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4378864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4378864","articleId":"4379013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4379025,"authors":[{"name":"Chong-xian Zhong","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chong-xian","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37950470800"},{"name":"Lu-xi Yang","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lu-xi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292054200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1283-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1284-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4379025","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic scheduling","Resource management","Downlink","MIMO","Feedback","Channel state information","Physical layer","Media Access Protocol","Delay effects","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","feedback","MIMO communication","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer scheduling","dynamic resource allocation","downlink multiuser MIMO systems","limited feedback","downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems","channel state information","queue state information","media access control layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cross-layer scheduling","dynamic resource allocation","downlink multiuser MIMO systems","limited feedback"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a cross-layer scheduling and dynamic resource allocation (CLSDRA) strategy for downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with limited feedback.

In the hardware-dependent stage, the channel resources are adaptively allocated to the flows according to the user priorities. All flows with a sufficiently high channel capacity are transmitted in parallel by assigning different OFDMA subcarriers or different spatial subchannels to the users.

The maximum stable throughput of the cognitive link in this scenario is derived for a fixed throughput selected by the primary link.

In conventional scheduling methods, adaptive modulation and coding (AMQ) is adopted to realize rate adaptation. However, this may greatly increase the transceiver and protocol complexity. To overcome this, scheduling methods based on fixed modulation are studied in this paper. In this case, the scheduler only needs to determine whether the transmitter is active at given channel and buffer state. When the transmitter is active, it will transmit in a fixed data rate, by using power adaptation to achieve a required SNR at the receiver. Our aim is to minimize the average packet delay given constraint on average power. To do that, we shall derive the analytical results of delay, packet-loss rate, and power consumption of cross-layer scheduling. It will then be shown that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between delay and power, which characterize the performance limit of cross-layer scheduling. In addition, a delay-optimal scheduling method will also be presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Delay-Power Tradeoff in Wireless Transmission with Fixed Modulation","publicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Cross Layer Design","doi":"10.1109/IWCLD.2007.4379038","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Cross Layer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379018/4379019/04379038.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCLD.2007.4379038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379038","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Delay-Power Tradeoff in Wireless Transmission with Fixed Modulation","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379038/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10089333","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Delay-Power Tradeoff in Wireless Transmission with Fixed Modulation","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"IWCLD-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07198S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379018","isNumber":"4379019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379018","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4379019","articleId":"4379038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4379039,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Yu","affiliation":["PCN&SS Lab., Sci. & Technol.

It is demonstrated in the simulation result that the proposed algorithm can improve the system performance in terms of throughput, packet loss rate, packet delay and fairness.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for OFDMA System Based on Genetic Algorithm","publicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Cross Layer Design","doi":"10.1109/IWCLD.2007.4379039","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Cross Layer Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379018/4379019/04379039.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCLD.2007.4379039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for OFDMA System Based on Genetic Algorithm","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379039/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"10075882","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for OFDMA System Based on Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"IWCLD-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052446S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379018","isNumber":"4379019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379018","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4379019","articleId":"4379039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379043,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald Bohnke","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Bohnke","id":"37270656500"},{"name":"Karl-Dirk Kammeyer","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl-Dirk","lastName":"Kammeyer","id":"37270666500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1283-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1284-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4379043","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Covariance matrix","Resource management","Downlink","Mobile antennas","Convergence","Gradient methods","MIMO","Data engineering","Niobium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","conjugate gradient methods","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted sum rate maximization","MIMO-downlink","projected conjugate gradient algorithm","cross-layer based resource allocation","multiple antenna system","dirty paper preceding","Monte-Carlo simulation"]}],"abstract":"The maximization of a weighted sum of data rates is an essential point in cross-layer based resource allocation.

By allocation, a 3-D interleaving is implemented to improve the reliance of the communication, and a cross-layer feedback is operated to inform the encoder for a more resilient coding processing to obtain optimal transmission quality.

Many of the practical WZ video coding solutions available in the literature make use of a feedback channel (FC) to perform rate control at the decoder which implies there must be a FC available in the application scenario addressed. The FC-based DVC solutions also have implications in terms of delay and decoder complexity since several iterative decoding operations may be needed to decode the data to the target quality level. In this context, this paper proposes an encoder rate control (ERC) solution for the transform domain WZ coding architecture previously using a FC driven rate control. Although this is the first solution in the literature, promising results are achieved with the proposed ERC solution without significantly increase the encoder complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379078","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379065/04379078.pdf","startPage":"II - 5","endPage":"II - 8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encoder Rate Control for Transform Domain Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379078/","displayDocTitle":"Encoder Rate Control for Transform Domain Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820507","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379078/","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encoder Rate Control for Transform Domain Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-2-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040906S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4379065","articleId":"4379078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4379079,"authors":[{"name":"Xavi Artigas","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavi","lastName":"Artigas","id":"37295527800"},{"name":"Simon Malinowski","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes I, France"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Malinowski","id":"37571528200"},{"name":"Christine Guillemot","affiliation":["RISA/INRIA, France"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Guillemot","id":"37274492200"},{"name":"Luis Torres","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Torres","id":"37266443500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379079","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Decoding","Arithmetic","AWGN","Samarium","Clocks","Turbo codes","Entropy","Error probability","Automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arithmetic codes","automata theory","data compression","decoding","entropy","error statistics","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed video coding","Slepian-Wolf code","overlapped quasiarithmetic code","lossy compression","entropy","decoding","error probability","state model","automata theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed video coding","Wyner-Ziv coding","coding with side information","arithmetic codes"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes Slepian-Wolf codes based on overlapped quasi-arithmetic codes, where overlapping allows lossy compression of the source below its entropy.

We show both theoretically and experimentally that a bit plane-based encoder has the same performance as a symbol-based coder, if an appropriate dependency model is chosen.

Applying Visual Attention to Image Quality Metric","abstract":"The aim of an objective image quality assessment is to find an automatic algorithm that evaluates the quality of pictures or video as a human observer would do. To reach this goal, researchers try to simulate the Human Visual System (HVS). Visual attention is a main feature of the HVS, but few studies have been done on using it in image quality assessment. In this work, we investigate the use of the visual attention information in their final pooling step. The rationale of this choice is that an artefact is likely more annoying in a salient region than in other areas. To shed light on this point, a quality assessment campaign has been conducted during which eye movements have been recorded. The results show that applying the visual attention to image quality assessment is not trivial, even with the ground truth.","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379065/04379119.pdf","startPage":"II - 169","endPage":"II - 172","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379119","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379119","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379119","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Humans","Quality assessment","Degradation","Visual system","Research and development","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image quality metric","image quality assessment","picture quality","video quality","human visual system","visual attention information","image quality perception"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visual attention","image quality assessment","eye tracking","error pooling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379119/","displayDocTitle":"Does where you Gaze on an Image Affect your Perception of Quality?

The AHMM outperforms an early fusion HMM by 5.7% recognition rate (a rel. error reduction of 38.5%) for clear data. For occluded data, the improvement is in average 6.5% recognition rate (rel. error red. 40%). Thus asynchronity is a dominant factor in meeting analysis, even if the data is disturbed. The AHMM exploits this and is therefore much more robust against disturbances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Multi-Modal Group Action Recognition in Meetings from Disturbed Videos with the Asynchronous Hidden Markov Model","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379130","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379065/04379130.pdf","startPage":"II - 213","endPage":"II - 216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Multi-Modal Group Action Recognition in Meetings from Disturbed Videos with the Asynchronous Hidden Markov Model","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4379130/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820549","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Multi-Modal Group Action Recognition in Meetings from Disturbed Videos with the Asynchronous Hidden Markov Model","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-2-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04646S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4379065","articleId":"4379130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4379145,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Chacon","affiliation":["DSP & Vision Laboratory, Chihuahua Institute of Technology, Mexico"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Chacon","id":"37338884200"},{"name":"Annamalai Manickavasagan","affiliation":["Department of Biosystems Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Annamalai","lastName":"Manickavasagan","id":"38277382200"},{"name":"Daniel Flores-Tapia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Flores-Tapia","id":"38324987200"},{"name":"Gabriel Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Canada"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37277245000"},{"name":"Digvir S.

The quality of these exports is well known and factors such as lack of insect infestation are very important. The use of thermal images for subsequent analysis of temperatures profiles for grain classification and insect detection is a method under investigation. This paper presents an approach for automatic image segmentation of the wheat kernels based on the combined use of wavelet analysis and pulse coupled neural networks. It is shown that using wavelets as a preprocessing technique yields a consistent accurate segmentation in terms of the iteration number in which the network yields reliable edges of the wheat kernels. Subsequent analysis of these segmentations can determine internal qualities such as infestations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379145/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9820563","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4379145/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of Wheat Grains in Thermal Images Based on Pulse Coupled Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of Wheat Grains in Thermal Images Based on Pulse Coupled Neural Networks","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-2-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051702S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4379065","articleId":"4379145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379163,"authors":[{"name":"Vijayaraghavan Thirumalai","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Signal Processing Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Vijayaraghavan","lastName":"Thirumalai","id":"37567823700"},{"name":"Ivana Tosic","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Signal Processing Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ivana","lastName":"Tosic","id":"37294882500"},{"name":"Pascal Frossard","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Signal Processing Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Frossard","id":"37285156300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379163","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of compact representation of a 3D scene, captured by distributed omnidirectional cameras. As the images from the sensors are likely to be correlated in most practical scenarios, we build a distributed algorithm based on coding with side information. A reference image is processed with a wavelet transform and progressively encoded. The Wyner-Ziv images undergo a multiresolution representation, and the generated bitplanes are channel encoded with LDPC codes. The central decoder eventually reconstructs the Wyner-Ziv images given by the syndrome bits from the channel codes using the reference omnidirectional image. It also iteratively implements motion estimation on the 2-sphere in order to improve the side information. Experimental results demonstrate that distributed coding improves the rate-distortion performance for coding a set of omnidirectional images when compared to independent coding solutions. The proposed method can further be extended to the decoding of multiple Wyner-Ziv images using one single reference omnidirectional image. Hence, it achieves a reduced overall coding rate compared to disparity-based schemes. In addition, it does not require explicit knowledge of the camera parameters nor precise calibration, which is certainly interesting in camera networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379065/04379163.pdf","startPage":"II - 345","endPage":"II - 348","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Coding of Multiresolution Omnidirectional Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image resolution","Cameras","Iterative decoding","Layout","Image sensors","Distributed algorithms","Wavelet transforms","Parity check codes","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","channel coding","image coding","image representation","image resolution","motion estimation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed coding","multiresolution omnidirectional images","compact representation","distributed omnidirectional cameras","Wyner-Ziv images","LDPC codes","channel codes","motion estimation","disparity-based schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed coding","omnidirectional imaging","plenoptic function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Coding of Multiresolution Omnidirectional Images","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4379163/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820579","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Coding of Multiresolution Omnidirectional Images","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-2-98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081555S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4379065","articleId":"4379163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4379181,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Biometrics Research Center, Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280177000"},{"name":"Zhenhua Guo","affiliation":["Biometrics Research Center, Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Guo","id":"37397436100"},{"name":"Zhou Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291903900"},{"name":"David Zhang","affiliation":["Biometrics Research Center, Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279211300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379181","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Biometrics","Fingerprint recognition","Robustness","Iris","Authentication","Image databases","Wavelet domain","Image quality","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","fingerprint identification","image matching","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["palmprint verification","complex wavelet transform","biometric characteristic","automatic palmprint authentication systems","palmprint matching","palmprint image registration","complex wavelet structural similarity index","fast rough alignment","palmprint images","state-of-the-art methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometrics","palmprint","complex wavelet transform","similarity measurement"]}],"abstract":"Palmprint is a unique and reliable biometric characteristic with high usability. With the increasing demand of automatic palmprint authentication systems, the development of accurate and robust palmprint verification algorithms has been attracting a lot of interests. The relative translation, rotation and distortion between two palmprint images will introduce much error in palmprint matching. However, an accurate registration of palmprint images is too time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a modified complex wavelet structural similarity index (CW-SSIM) to compute the matching score and hence identify the input palmprint. Since CW-SSIM is robust to translation, small rotation and distortion, a fast rough alignment of palmprint images is sufficient. CW-SSIM is also insensitive to luminance and contrast changes. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by achieving a higher genuine acceptance rate and a lower false acceptance rate simultaneously.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Palmprint Verification using Complex Wavelet Transform","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379181","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379065/04379181.pdf","startPage":"II - 417","endPage":"II - 420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Palmprint Verification using Complex Wavelet Transform","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4379181/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820595","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Palmprint Verification using Complex Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-2-116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06177S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4379065","articleId":"4379181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379190,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

It is concluded that Fourier descriptors facilitate accurate isolation and ranking of a lesion's symmetry axes and provide an approach which could easily be integrated into new or existing diagnostic procedures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of Optimal Axes for Skin Lesion Asymmetry Quantification","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379190","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379065/04379190.pdf","startPage":"II - 453","endPage":"II - 456","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Determination of Optimal Axes for Skin Lesion Asymmetry Quantification","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4379190/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820604","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of Optimal Axes for Skin Lesion Asymmetry Quantification","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-2-125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059174S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4379065","articleId":"4379190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4379193,"authors":[{"name":"Sae Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UTA, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sae","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37558732000"},{"name":"JungHwan Oh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, UNT, Denton, TX, USA"],"firstName":"JungHwan","lastName":"Oh","id":"37336090100"},{"name":"Wallapak Tavanapong","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, I.S.U, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Wallapak","lastName":"Tavanapong","id":"37275861400"},{"name":"Johnny Wong","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, I.S.U, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Johnny","lastName":"Wong","id":"37279226500"},{"name":"Piet C. de Groen","affiliation":["Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Piet C.","lastName":"de Groen","id":"37698938900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379193","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":599},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Colonic polyps","Colonoscopy","Shape","Image segmentation","Image analysis","Image texture analysis","Computer science","Cancer detection","Colon","Image edge detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","biomedical optical imaging","cancer","feature extraction","medical image processing","object detection","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polyp detection","colonoscopy video","elliptical shape feature","cancer detection","computer-based analysis","texture features","stomach","fixed size analysis window","colon polyps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Colonoscopy","Polyp Detection","Ellipse Fitting","Image Registration"]}],"abstract":"Early detection of polyps and cancers is one of the most important goals of colonoscopy. Computer-based analysis of video files using texture features, as has been proposed for polyps of the stomach and colon, has two major limitations: this method uses a fixed size analysis window and relies heavily on a training set of images for accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new technique focusing on shape instead of texture in this paper. The proposed polyp region detection method is based on the elliptical shape that is common for nearly all small colon polyps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy Video using Elliptical Shape Feature","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379193","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379065/04379193.pdf","startPage":"II - 465","endPage":"II - 468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy Video using Elliptical Shape Feature","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4379193/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820607","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy Video using Elliptical Shape Feature","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-2-128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048033S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4379065","articleId":"4379193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379198,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Gonzalez-Diaz","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Gonzalez-Diaz","id":"38274461400"},{"name":"Fernando Diaz-de-Maria","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Diaz-de-Maria","id":"38277858800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379198","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"abstract":"In several video coding standards, such as H.264, motion estimation becomes the most-time consuming subsystem. Therefore, recently research on video coding focuses on the development of novel algorithms able to save computations with minimal effects over the coding distortion. Due to the fact that real video sequences usually exhibit a wide-range of motion content, from uniform to random, and to the vast amount of coding applications demanding different degrees of coding quality, adaptive algorithms have revealed as the most robust general purpose solutions. In particular, multi-pattern algorithms can adapt to video contents as well as to required coding quality by means of the use of a set of heterogeneus search patterns, each one adapting better to particular motion and quality requirements. This paper applies some improvements to the Motion Classification based Search, an adaptive multi-pattern algorithm based on motion classification techniques. Our experimental results show that MCS notably reduces the computational cost with respect to some well-known algorithms while maintaining the quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379065/04379198.pdf","startPage":"II - 485","endPage":"II - 488","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Motion Classification Techniques for Adaptive Multi-Pattern Fast Block-Matching Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Robustness","Video coding","Video sequences","Computational efficiency","Motion measurement","Switches","Communication standards","Adaptive algorithm","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","image classification","image matching","image sequences","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion classification","adaptive multipattern fast block-matching algorithm","video coding","H.264 standard","motion estimation","video sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block-matching","motion estimation","multi-pattern algorithms","motion classification","binary linear classifier"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Improved Motion Classification Techniques for Adaptive Multi-Pattern Fast Block-Matching Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4379198/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820610","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Motion Classification Techniques for Adaptive Multi-Pattern Fast Block-Matching Algorithm","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-2-133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081803S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4379065","articleId":"4379198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4379232,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Chung Lin","affiliation":["Information System Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yao-Chung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37578091700"},{"name":"David Varodayan","affiliation":["Information System Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Varodayan","id":"37297703600"},{"name":"Bernd Girod","affiliation":["Information System Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Girod","id":"37283315200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379232","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Source coding","Watermarking","Peer to peer computing","Image coding","Encoding","Decoding","Cryptography","Streaming media","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","message authentication","quantisation (signal)","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backward-compatible image authentication","distributed source coding","legitimate diversity","Slepian-Wolf encoding","image compression","quantized image projection","peer-to-peer file sharing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image authentication","distributed source coding","LDPC codes"]}],"abstract":"Image authentication is important in content delivery via untrusted intermediaries, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. Many differently encoded versions of the original image might exist. On the other hand, intermediaries might tamper with the contents. Distinguishing the legitimate diversity of encodings from malicious manipulation is the challenge addressed in this paper. We develop a novel approach based on distributed source coding for the problem of backward-compatible image authentication. The key idea is to provide a Slepian-Wolf encoded quantized image projection as authentication data. This version can be correctly decoded only with the help of an authentic image as side information. Distributed source coding provides the desired robustness against legitimate encoding variations, while detecting illegitimate modification. We demonstrate false acceptance rates close to zero for authentication data sizes that are only a few percent of the compressed image size.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379232","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379219/04379232.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379232","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","startPage":"III - 5","endPage":"III - 8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Authentication Based on Distributed Source Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379232","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Image Authentication Based on Distributed Source Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379232/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4379232/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9811991","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Authentication Based on Distributed Source Coding","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-3-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085889S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4379219","articleId":"4379232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4379237,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37310961400"},{"name":"Vladimir Stankovic","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Stankovic","id":"37392809100"},{"name":"Wei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37278812100"},{"name":"Zixiang Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zixiang","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37278484800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379237","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"abstract":"Following recent works on the rate region of the quadratic Gaussian two-terminal source coding problem and limit-approaching code designs, this paper examines multiterminal source coding of two correlated video sequences to save the sum rate over independent coding. Specifically, the first video sequence is coded by H.264 and used at the joint decoder to facilitate Wyner-Ziv coding of the second video sequence. The first I-frame of the right sequence is successively coded by H.264 and Slepian-Wolf coding. An efficient stereo matching algorithm based on loopy belief propagation is then adopted at the decoder to produce pixel-level disparity maps between the corresponding frames of the two decoded video sequences on the fly. Based on the disparity maps, side information for both motion vectors and motion-compensated residual frames of the second sequence are generated at the decoder before Wyner-Ziv encoding. Experimental results on stereo video sequences using H.264, LDPC codes for Slepian-Wolf coding of the motion vectors and scalar quantization in conjunction with LDPC codes for Wyner-Ziv coding of the residual coefficients show savings in terms of the sum-rate when compared to separate H.264 coding at the same video quality.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Decoding","Video sequences","Source coding","Cameras","Parity check codes","Quantization","Video compression","Image coding","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","decoding","image sequences","motion compensation","parity check codes","source coding","stereo image processing","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiterminal video coding","quadratic Gaussian two-terminal source coding","limit-approaching code design","video sequence","H.264 coding","joint decoder","Wyner-Ziv coding","stereo matching algorithm","loopy belief propagation","motion vector","motion-compensated residual frames","LDPC codes","low density parity check codes","Slepian-Wolf coding","scalar quantization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiterminal video coding","stereo matching","H.264 standard"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379237","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379219/04379237.pdf","startPage":"III - 25","endPage":"III - 28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiterminal Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiterminal Video Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379237/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379237/","accessionNumber":"9806906","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiterminal Video Coding","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-3-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067703S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4379219","articleId":"4379237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4379238,"authors":[{"name":"Joo Ascenso","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Portugal"],"firstName":"Joo","lastName":"Ascenso","id":"37579968600"},{"name":"Fernando Pereira","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Portugal","Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Portugal"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37290921400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379238","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":136},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379238","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","decoding","discrete cosine transforms","interpolation","motion compensation","motion estimation","source coding","statistical analysis","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive hash-based side information exploitation","Wyner-Ziv video coding","lossy source coding paradigm","video statistics","decoder","motion compensation tools","bidirectional hash motion estimation framework","DCT hash coding","trajectory-based motion interpolation","adaptive DCT band selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hash-based motion estimation","Wyner-Ziv video coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379238","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379219/04379238.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","startPage":"III - 29","endPage":"III - 32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Hash-Based Side Information Exploitation for Efficient Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","abstract":"Wyner-Ziv video coding is a lossy source coding paradigm where the video statistics are exploited, partially or totally at the decoder.

Our framework provides an alternative to multiscale pre-defined dictionaries such as wavelets, curvelets, and contourlets, with dictionaries optimized for the data and application instead of pre-modelled ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4379257/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820645","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Sparse Image Representationwith Learned Dictionaries","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Sparse Image Representationwith Learned Dictionaries","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-3-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058855S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4379219","articleId":"4379257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":4379260,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Jean Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Seung-Jean","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279281000"},{"name":"Kwangmoo Koh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kwangmoo","lastName":"Koh","id":"37824981100"},{"name":"Michael Lustig","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lustig","id":"37828707700"},{"name":"Stephen Boyd","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Boyd","id":"37275279800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379260","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":941},"abstract":"Compressed sensing or compressive sampling (CS) has been receiving a lot of interest as a promising method for signal recovery and sampling. CS problems can be cast as convex problems, and then solved by several standard methods such as interior-point methods, at least for small and medium size problems. In this paper we describe a specialized interior-point method for solving CS problems that uses a preconditioned conjugate gradient method to compute the search step. The method can efficiently solve large CS problems, by exploiting fast algorithms for the signal transforms used. The method is demonstrated with a medical resonance imaging (MRI) example.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379219/04379260.pdf","startPage":"III - 117","endPage":"III - 120","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Method for Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Sampling methods","Quadratic programming","Optimization methods","Gradient methods","Biomedical imaging","Magnetic resonance imaging","Vectors","Reconstruction algorithms","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","compressive sampling","signal recovery","interior-point method","preconditioned conjugate gradient method","medical resonance imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","compressive sampling","l1 regularization","interior-point methods","preconditioned conjugate gradients"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379260/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Method for Compressed Sensing","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4379260/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820647","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Method for Compressed Sensing","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-3-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077847S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4379219","articleId":"4379260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4379268,"authors":[{"name":"Neelam Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Neelam","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37967849900"},{"name":"Manojkumar Saranathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Manojkumar","lastName":"Saranathan","id":"37947396600"},{"name":"K.

In order to increase the resolution in both domains simultaneously, parallel imaging schemes have been in existence, where multiple receiver coils are used, each of which needs to acquire only a fraction of the total available signal. In our approach, we regularly un-dersample the signal at each of the receiver coils and the resulting aliased coil images are combined (unaliased) using the neural network framework. Data acquisition follows a variable-density sampling scheme, where lower frequencies are densely sampled, and the remaining signal is sparsely sampled. The low resolution images obtained using the densely sampled low frequencies are used to train the neural network. Reconstruction of the image is carried out by feeding the high-resolution aliased images to the trained network. The proposed approach has been applied to phantom as well as real brain MRI data sets, and results have been compared with the standard existing parallel imaging techniques. The proposed approach is found to perform better than the standard existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379268","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379219/04379268.pdf","startPage":"III - 149","endPage":"III - 152","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9820654","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4379268/","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Neural Networks","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-3-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061048S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4379219","articleId":"4379268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379272,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingyu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406106900"},{"name":"Jizheng Xu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jizheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37279201100"},{"name":"Feng Wu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37272892600"},{"name":"Qionghai Dai","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qionghai","lastName":"Dai","id":"37273514100"},{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281434600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379272","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Image coding","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Noise shaping","Asia","PSNR","Automation","Iterative algorithms","Bit rate","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image coding","iterative methods","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","2D anisotropic dual-tree discrete wavelet transform","anisotropic decomposition","iterative projection-based noise shaping algorithm","zero-tree relationship","JPEG2000"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-D DDWT","anisotropic decomposition","redundant wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"We propose an image coding scheme using 2-D anisotropic dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DDWT).

This paper presents a depth-image representation employing triangular meshes to benefit both in obtaining higher compression factors and directly enabling fast intermediate-view rendering on commodity graphics hardware. Previous mesh-based representations did not consider the fact that assigning wrong depth values along object boundaries results in well-observable artifacts in the intermediate-view rendering. We solve this problem by assigning two depth values per node to better model sharp depth discontinuities. Furthermore, we ensure that mesh-edges are placed along object borders, preventing that triangles span background as well as objects at the same time. The results show good intermediate-view rendering quality, object/background separation, and good rate-distortion performance up to about 40 dB PSNR at a bit rate of 0.05 bits/pixel.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DTV.2007.4379390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379375","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3DTV Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379374/4379375/04379390.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth-Image Representation Employing Meshes for Intermediate-View Rendering and Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4379390/","displayDocTitle":"Depth-Image Representation Employing Meshes for Intermediate-View Rendering and Coding","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9798560","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth-Image Representation Employing Meshes for Intermediate-View Rendering and Coding","confLoc":"Kos, Greece","sourcePdf":"3DTV-00-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05178S","chronDate":"7-9 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379374","isNumber":"4379375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379374","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4379375","articleId":"4379390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379449,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Fehn","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Telecommunications, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Fehn","id":"37294911300"},{"name":"Peter Kauff","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Telecommunications, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Kauff","id":"37273993800"},{"name":"Sukhee Cho","affiliation":["Eletronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sukhee","lastName":"Cho","id":"37293575900"},{"name":"Hyoungjin Kwon","affiliation":["Eletronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoungjin","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37289125600"},{"name":"Namho Hur","affiliation":["Eletronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Namho","lastName":"Hur","id":"37285758900"},{"name":"Jinwoong Kim","affiliation":["Eletronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinwoong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293484700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0721-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0722-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2021"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-203X"}],"articleNumber":"4379449","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":435},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379449","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Video compression","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Video coding","Image quality","Video sequences","Codecs","Streaming media","Three dimensional displays","Mobile TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetric coding","stereoscopic video","multi-view video coding","disparity-compensated prediction","digital multimedia broadcasting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3DTV","stereoscopic video","asymmetric coding","Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an efficient approach for the compression of stereoscopic video sequences.

It is well known that low-frequency coefficients of the discrete cosine transforms (DCTs) preserve the most important image features. In this paper, we use multi-level DCTs (MDCTs) to generate image texture feature vectors for the purpose of CBIR. The texture feature vectors generated from MDCTs coefficients and Zernike moments are classified by support vector machines (SVMs). The experimental result shows good average retrieval accuracy. It also shows that DCT coefficients from low level resolution images are sufficient to extract image texture feature with significant less computing cost.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379510","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379494/04379510.pdf","startPage":"VI - 21","endPage":"VI - 24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Level Discrete Cosine Transform for Content-Based Image Retrieval by Support Vector Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379510/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Level Discrete Cosine Transform for Content-Based Image Retrieval by Support Vector Machines","volume":"6","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820939","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379510/","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Level Discrete Cosine Transform for Content-Based Image Retrieval by Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-6-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052002S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4379494","articleId":"4379510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4379516,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37405316000"},{"name":"Dan Schonfeld","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Schonfeld","id":"37294984500"},{"name":"Ashfaq Khokhar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ashfaq","lastName":"Khokhar","id":"37273553800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379516","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":749},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Image classification","Image segmentation","Context modeling","Recursive estimation","Viterbi algorithm","Application software","Image processing","Classification algorithms","Image generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","hidden Markov models","image classification","image segmentation","parameter estimation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D-HMM model","hidden Markov model","image classification","state transition probability","image processing applications","expectation-maximization algorithm","EM algorithm","general forward-backward algorithm","GFB algorithm","recursive model parameter estimation","conditional-independent subset-state sequence structure decomposition","2D Viterbi algorithm","image segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image classification","Hidden Markov models","Image segmentation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a general two-dimensional hidden Markov model (2D-HMM), where dependency of the state transition probability on any state is allowed as long as causality is preserved.

A new expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm suitable for estimation of the new model is derived, where a novel general forward-backward (GFB) algorithm is proposed for recursive estimation of the model parameters. A new conditional-independent subset-state sequence structure decomposition is proposed for the 2D Viterbi algorithm. The new model can be applied to many areas such as trajectory classification and image segmentation. Application to aerial image segmentation shows the superiority of our model compared to the existing 2D-HMM model.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379516","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379494/04379516.pdf","startPage":"VI - 41","endPage":"VI - 44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Two-Dimensional Hidden Markov Model and its Application in Image Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379516/","displayDocTitle":"A General Two-Dimensional Hidden Markov Model and its Application in Image Classification","volume":"6","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820942","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379516/","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Two-Dimensional Hidden Markov Model and its Application in Image Classification","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-6-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041908S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4379494","articleId":"4379516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379530,"authors":[{"name":"Hongmei Gou","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Hongmei","lastName":"Gou","id":"37078231400"},{"name":"Ashwin Swaminathan","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Swaminathan","id":"37299642400"},{"name":"Min Wu","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Wu","id":"37277237100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379530","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":820},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital images","Forensics","Steganography","Image analysis","Digital cameras","Noise reduction","Performance analysis","Feature extraction","Wavelet analysis","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data encapsulation","feature extraction","image denoising","multimedia computing","statistical analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical noise features","image tampering detection","steganalysis","low-cost image editing softwares","digital image authenticity","multimedia forensics","hidden data","image forensic analysis","denoising operations","wavelet analysis","neighborhood prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multimedia forensics","Tampering detection","steganalysis","noise features"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379530","abstract":"With increasing availability of low-cost image editing softwares, the authenticity of digital images can no longer be taken for granted.

Some applications also require the hash to be able to localize image tampering. This requires the hash to contain both robust content and alignment information to meet the above criterion. Fulfilling this is difficult because of two contradictory requirements. First, the hash should be small and second, to verify authenticity and then localize tampering, the amount of information in the hash about the original required would be large. Hence a tradeoff between these requirements needs to be found. This paper presents an image hashing method that addresses this concern, to not only detect but also localize tampering using a small signature (< 1kB).

Using an optimization process the appropriate coefficients are determined according to the hardware cost and quality requirements of each application.

Based on our previous work on spatio-temporall adaptive localized learning (STALL), we introduce a new concept of spatio-temporal resampling to facilitate the task of video modeling. Resampling produces a redundant representation of video signals with distributed spatio-temporal characteristics. When combined with STALL model, we show how to probabilistically combine the linear regression results of resampled video signals under a Bayesian framework. Such empirical Bayesian approach opens the door to develop a whole new class of video processing algorithms without explicit motion estimation or segmentation. The potential of our distributed video model is justified by considering its application into two multiframe image restoration tasks: repair damaged blocks and remove impulse noise.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379607","startPage":"VI - 405","endPage":"VI - 408","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379494/04379607.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video Modeling by Spatio-Temporal Resampling and Bayesian Fusion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Video Modeling by Spatio-Temporal Resampling and Bayesian Fusion","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4379607/","accessionNumber":"9821011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379607/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video Modeling by Spatio-Temporal Resampling and Bayesian Fusion","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-6-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047083S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","xplore-issue":"4379494","articleId":"4379607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4379609,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It is known that the performance of any Wyner-Ziv coder is heavily dependent on the efficiency of the side-information generation. We propose an iterative block based scheme to generate a semi super-resolution frame using the past and future reference frames which should be coded at full-resolution. To enable this side-information generation the framework should allow for low encoding complexity, reducing the spatial resolution only in the non-reference frames. The enhancement layer is produced using a residual frame of the reduced resolution encoded frame. The decoder first decodes the low resolution base layer and iteratively generates the side-information, along with channel decoding, to obtain a higher quality version of the decoded frame. Results of the implementation of the framework using the motion-based side-information in the H.263+ and H.264 standards are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379494/04379609.pdf","startPage":"VI - 413","endPage":"VI - 416","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion-Based Side-Information Generation for a Scalable Wyner-Ziv Video Coder","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","Iterative decoding","Video coding","Motion estimation","Video codecs","Rate-distortion","Motion analysis","Error correction codes","Feedback","Source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image resolution","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion-based side-information generation","scalable Wyner-Ziv video coder","semi super-resolution","spatial resolution","channel decoding","H.263+ standards","H.264 standards","iterative block based scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed video coding","side-information generation","reversed-complexity","scalable video coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Motion-Based Side-Information Generation for a Scalable Wyner-Ziv Video Coder","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4379609/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9821013","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion-Based Side-Information Generation for a Scalable Wyner-Ziv Video Coder","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-6-115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074247S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4379494","articleId":"4379609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4379636,"authors":[{"name":"Naeem Ramzan","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Naeem","lastName":"Ramzan","id":"38556798400"},{"name":"Shuai Wan","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Wan","id":"37290796600"},{"name":"Ebroul Izquierdo","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Ebroul","lastName":"Izquierdo","id":"38320860000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379636","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel approach for transmission of scalable video over wireless channel is proposed. The proposed approach jointly optimises the bit allocation between a wavelet-based scalable video coding framework and a forward error correction codes. The forward error correction codes is based on the serial concatenation of LDPC codes and turbo codes. Turbo codes shows good performance at high error rates region but LDPC outperforms turbo codes at low error rates. So the concatenation of LDPC and TC enhances the performance at both low and high signal to noise ratios. The scheme minimizes the reconstructed video distortion at the decoder subject to a constraint on the overall transmission bitrate budget. The minimization is achieved by exploiting the source rate distortion characteristics and the statistics of the available codes. Furthermore, an efficient decoding algorithm is proposed.

Yet, even without instantaneous knowledge of the geometry, the search for corresponding points can be restricted to areas called epipolar spaces. For each point in one image, we define the corresponding epipolar space in the other image as the union of all associated epipolar lines over all possible system geometries. Epipolar spaces eliminate the need for calibration at the cost of an increased search region. One approach to mitigate this increase is the application of a space variant sampling or foveation strategy. While the application of such strategies to stereo vision tasks is not new, only rarely has a foveation scheme been specifically tailored for a stereo vision task. In this paper we derive a foundation of theorems that provide a means for obtaining optimal sampling schemes for a given set of epipolar spaces. An optimal sampling scheme is defined as a strategy that minimizes the average area per epipolar space.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379642","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379494/04379642.pdf","startPage":"VI - 545","endPage":"VI - 548","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Epipolar Spaces and Optimal Sampling Strategies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Epipolar Spaces and Optimal Sampling Strategies","isConference":true,"volume":"6","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4379642/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9821027","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379642/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Epipolar Spaces and Optimal Sampling Strategies","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-6-148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042293S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","xplore-issue":"4379494","articleId":"4379642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4379665,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua N.

In this paper we present a robust and low-complexity algorithm to self-localize and orient sensors in a network based on angle-of-arrival (AOA) information. The proposed non-iterative subspace-based method is robust to missing and noisy measurements and works for cases when sensor orientations are either known or unknown. We show that the computational complexity of the algorithm is O(mn\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), where m is the number of measurements and n is the total number of sensors. Simulation results demonstrate that the error of the proposed subspace algorithm is only marginally greater than an iterative maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), while the computational complexity is two orders of magnitude less. Additionally, the iterative MLE is prone to converge to local maxima in the likelihood function without accurate initialization. We illustrate that the proposed subspace method can be used to initialize the MLE and obtain near-Cramer-Rao performance for sensor localization. Finally, the scalability of the subspace algorithm is illustrated by demonstrating how clusters within a large network may be individually localized and then merged.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379665","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379651/4379652/04379665.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"68","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust System Multiangulation Using Subspace Methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust System Multiangulation Using Subspace Methods","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4379665/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9682991","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379665/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust System Multiangulation Using Subspace Methods","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPSN-00-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084637S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379651","isNumber":"4379652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379651","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4379652","articleId":"4379665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEEACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4379666,"authors":[{"name":"Mo Li","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Mo","lastName":"Li","id":"37309690200"},{"name":"Yunhao Liu","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yunhao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279413400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-638-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4379666","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":998},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Computerized monitoring","Wireless communication","Sensor systems","Scalability","Employee welfare","Condition monitoring","Collaboration","Prototypes","Computer network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","condition monitoring","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale trace-driven simulation","underground collapses","mesh sensor network deployment","structure-aware self-adaptive system","wireless sensor networks","underground structure monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms","Design","Measurement","Wireless Sensor Networks","Structure Monitoring","Underground","Coal Mine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379666","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379666","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","abstract":"Environment monitoring in coal mines is an important application of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that has commercial potential.

Average consensus algorithms are protocols to compute the average value of all sensor measurements via near neighbors communications. The main motivation for our work is the observation that consensus algorithms offer the perfect example of network communications where there is an increasing correlation between the data exchanged, as the system updates its computations. Henceforth, it is possible to utilize previously exchanged data and current side information to reduce significantly the demands of quantization bit rate for a certain precision. We analyze the case of a network with a topology built as that of a random geometric graph and with links that are assumed to be reliable at a constant bit rate. Numerically we show that in consensus algorithms, increasing number of iterations does not have the effect of increasing the error variance. Thus, we conclude that noisy recursions lead to a consensus if the data correlation is exploited in the messages source encoders and decoders. We briefly state the theoretical results which are parallel to our numerical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379668","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379651/4379652/04379668.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Nested Lattice Encoding for Consensus Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379668/","displayDocTitle":"Differential Nested Lattice Encoding for Consensus Problems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9696772","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379668/","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Nested Lattice Encoding for Consensus Problems","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPSN-00-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064988S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379651","isNumber":"4379652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379651","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4379652","articleId":"4379668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACMIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379685,"authors":[{"name":"Sukun Kim","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sukun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37675547000"},{"name":"Shamim Pakzad","affiliation":["Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Shamim","lastName":"Pakzad","id":"37411429300"},{"name":"David Culler","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Culler","id":"37279605700"},{"name":"James Demmel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Demmel","id":"37281843900"},{"name":"Gregory Fenves","affiliation":["Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Fenves","id":"37947401200"},{"name":"Steven Glaser","affiliation":["Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Glaser","id":"37585981200"},{"name":"Martin Turon","affiliation":["Crossbow Technology, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Turon","id":"37427831200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-638-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4379685","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":164,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Bridges","Vibration measurement","Costs","X-ray detection","X-ray detectors","Computerized monitoring","Design engineering","Testing","Poles and towers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridges (structures)","condition monitoring","structural engineering","vibration measurement","vibrations","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["health monitoring","civil infrastructures","wireless sensor networks","south tower","Golden Gate Bridge","structural vibrations","hop network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Experimentation","Reliability","Design","Wireless Sensor Networks","Structural Health Monitoring","Deployment","Large-Scale"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379685","abstract":"A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is designed, implemented, deployed and tested on the 4200 ft long main span and the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge (GGB).

Leaks and ruptures in water supply pipelines and blockages and overflow events in sewer collectors cost millions of dollars a year, and monitoring and repairing this underground infrastructure presents a severe challenge. In this paper, we discuss how wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of operational data from pipeline infrastructures and thus address the challenge of near real-time monitoring and eventually control. We focus on the use of WSNs for monitoring large diameter bulk-water transmission pipelines. We outline a system, PipeNet, we have been developing for collecting hydraulic and acoustic/vibration data at high sampling rates as well as algorithms for analyzing this data to detect and locate leaks. Challenges include sampling at high data rates, maintaining aggressive duty cycles, and ensuring tightly time- synchronized data collection, all under a strict power budget. We have carried out an extensive field trial with Boston Water and Sewer Commission in order to evaluate some of the critical components of PipeNet. Along with the results of this preliminary trial, we describe the results of extensive laboratory experiments which are used to evaluate our analysis and data processing solutions. Our prototype deployment has led to the development of a reusable, field-reprogrammable software infrastructure for distributed high-rate signal processing in wireless sensor networks, which we also describe.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379686","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379651/4379652/04379686.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379686","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","startPage":"264","endPage":"273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PIPENET: A Wireless Sensor Network for Pipeline Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"PIPENET: A Wireless Sensor Network for Pipeline Monitoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379686/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379686/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9705268","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PIPENET: A Wireless Sensor Network for Pipeline Monitoring","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPSN-00-34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080107S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379651","isNumber":"4379652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379651","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"4379652","articleId":"4379686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4379692,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Quan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Quan","id":"37401122300"},{"name":"William J.

We address the problem of recovering an approximation of the n data values by querying any L sensors, so that the reconstruction error is comparable to the optimal fc-term approximation. To solve this problem, we present a novel distributed algorithm based on sparse random projections, which requires no global coordination or knowledge. The key idea is that the sparsity of the random projections greatly reduces the communication cost of pre-processing the data. Our algorithm allows the collector to choose the number of sensors to query according to the desired approximation error. The reconstruction quality depends only on the number of sensors queried, enabling robust refinable approximation.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379693","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379651/4379652/04379693.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Sparse Random Projections for Refinable Approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379693/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Sparse Random Projections for Refinable Approximation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9696792","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379693/","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Sparse Random Projections for Refinable Approximation","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPSN-00-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14303S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379651","isNumber":"4379652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379651","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4379652","articleId":"4379693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379696,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Hengstler","affiliation":["Wireless Sensor Networks Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Hengstler","id":"37329259300"},{"name":"Daniel Prashanth","affiliation":["Wireless Sensor Networks Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Prashanth","id":"37296705900"},{"name":"Sufen Fong","affiliation":["Wireless Sensor Networks Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sufen","lastName":"Fong","id":"37970333200"},{"name":"Hamid Aghajan","affiliation":["Wireless Sensor Networks Laboratory Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Aghajan","id":"37296707500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-638-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4379696","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":581},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379696","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart cameras","Surveillance","Intelligent networks","Intelligent systems","Engines","Energy efficiency","Machine vision","Stereo vision","Color","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image resolution","image sensors","intelligent sensors","object detection","stereo image processing","surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MeshEye","hybrid-resolution smart camera","distributed intelligent surveillance","vision-enabled network","pixel-processing algorithm","low-resolution stereo vision system","high-resolution image sub-array","color camera module","battery-powered operation","object detection","acquisition","tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms","Design","Experimentation","Measurement","Performance","Distributed Intelligence","Mote Architecture","Power Efficiency","Smart Cameras","Wireless Sensor Networks"]}],"abstract":"Surveillance is one of the promising applications to which smart camera motes forming a vision-enabled network can add increasing levels of intelligence. We see a high degree of in-node processing in combination with distributed reasoning algorithms as the key enablers for such intelligent surveillance systems. To put these systems into practice still requires a considerable amount of research ranging from mote architectures, pixel-processing algorithms, up to distributed reasoning engines. This paper introduces MeshEye, an energy-efficient smart camera mote architecture that has been designed with intelligent surveillance as the target application in mind. Special attention is given to MeshEye's unique vision system: a low-resolution stereo vision system continuously determines position, range, and size of moving objects entering its field of view. This information triggers a color camera module to acquire a high-resolution image sub-array containing the object, which can be efficiently processed in subsequent stages. It offers reduced complexity, response time, and power consumption over conventional solutions. Basic vision algorithms for object detection, acquisition, and tracking are described and illustrated on real- world data. The paper also presents a basic power model that estimates lifetime of our smart camera mote in battery-powered operation for intelligent surveillance event processing.","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379651/4379652/04379696.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"369","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MeshEye: A Hybrid-Resolution Smart Camera Mote for Applications in Distributed Intelligent Surveillance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"MeshEye: A Hybrid-Resolution Smart Camera Mote for Applications in Distributed Intelligent Surveillance","htmlLink":"/document/4379696/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","accessionNumber":"9696796","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MeshEye: A Hybrid-Resolution Smart Camera Mote for Applications in Distributed Intelligent Surveillance","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPSN-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0507S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379651","isNumber":"4379652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379651","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4379652","articleId":"4379696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACMIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4379701,"authors":[{"name":"Suman Nath","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, UK"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Nath","id":"37298275000"},{"name":"Aman Kansal","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, UK"],"firstName":"Aman","lastName":"Kansal","id":"37283215000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-638-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4379701","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":171},"abstract":"FlashDB is a self-tuning database optimized for sensor networks using NAND flash storage. In practical systems flash is used in different packages such as on-board flash chips, compact flash cards, secure digital cards and related formats. Our experiments reveal non-trivial differences in their access costs. Furthermore, databases may be subject to different types of workloads. We show that existing databases for flash are not optimized for all types of flash devices or for all workloads and their performance is thus subop- timal in many practical systems. FlashDB uses a novel self-tuning index that dynamically adapts its storage structure to workload and underlying storage device. We formalize the self-tuning nature of an index as a two-state task system and propose a 3-competitive online algorithm that achieves the theoretical optimum. We also provide a framework to determine the optimal size of an index node that minimizes energy and latency for a given device. Finally, we propose optimizations to further improve the performance of our index. We prototype and compare different indexing schemes on multiple flash devices and workloads, and show that our indexing scheme outperforms existing schemes under all workloads and flash devices we consider.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379651/4379652/04379701.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"419","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FlashDB: Dynamic Self-tuning Database for NAND Flash","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexing","Algorithm design and analysis","Energy storage","Hard disks","Packaging","Costs","Delay","Prototypes","Database systems","Query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database indexing","flash memories","NAND circuits","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FlashDB","dynamic self-tuning database","sensor networks","NAND flash storage","systems flash","access costs","self-tuning index","storage structure","two-state task system","online algorithm","indexing schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms","Design","Measurement","Performance","B+-tree","NAND Flash","indexing","log-structured index","self-tuning index"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"FlashDB: Dynamic Self-tuning Database for NAND Flash","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379701/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9696801","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FlashDB: Dynamic Self-tuning Database for NAND Flash","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPSN-00-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094602S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379651","isNumber":"4379652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379651","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4379652","articleId":"4379701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACMIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4379704,"authors":[{"name":"Suman Nath","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, UK"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Nath","id":"37298275000"},{"name":"Phillip B.

However, previous work on geographic routing makes the unrealistic assumption that all the nodes in the network are awake during routing. This overlooks the common deployment scenario where sensor nodes are duty-cycled to save energy. In this paper we investigate several important aspects of geographic routing over duty-cycled nodes. First, we extend existing geographic routing algorithms to handle the highly dynamic networks resulting from duty-cycling. Second, we provide the first formal analysis of the performance of geographic routing on duty-cycled nodes. Third, we use this analysis to develop an efficient decentralized sleep scheduling algorithm for reducing the number of awake nodes while maintaining both network coverage and a (tunable) target routing latency. Finally, we evaluate via simulation the performance of our approach versus running existing geographic routing algorithms on sensors duty-cycled according to previous sleep scheduling algorithms. Our results show, perhaps surprisingly, that a network of duty-cycled nodes can have slightly better routing performance than a static network that uses comparable energy. Our results further show that, compared to previous algorithms, our sleep scheduling algorithm significantly improves routing latency and network lifetime.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4379704/","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9696802","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Communicating via Fireflies: Geographic Routing on Duty-Cycled Sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communicating via Fireflies: Geographic Routing on Duty-Cycled Sensors","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPSN-00-52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077374S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379651","isNumber":"4379652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379651","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4379652","articleId":"4379704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4379708,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Luk","affiliation":["CyLaboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Luk","id":"37955124800"},{"name":"Ghita Mezzour","affiliation":["CyLaboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ghita","lastName":"Mezzour","id":"37888142200"},{"name":"Adrian Perrig","affiliation":["CyLaboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Perrig","id":"37271812800"},{"name":"Virgil Gligor","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Virgil","lastName":"Gligor","id":"37266359100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-638-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4379708","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":628},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379708","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["ZigBee","Energy consumption","Protocols","Protection","Data security","Broadcasting","Cryptography","Authentication","Unicast","Broadcast technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MiniSec","secure sensor network communication architecture","data secrecy","authentication","replay protection","TinySec","ZigBee","single-source communication","multi-source broadcast communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Design","Sensor network security","secure communication architecture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379708","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379651/4379652/04379708.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MiniSec: A Secure Sensor Network Communication Architecture","abstract":"Secure sensor network communication protocols need to provide three basic properties: data secrecy, authentication, and replay protection. Secure sensor network link layer protocols such as Tiny- Sec (C. Karlof et al., 2004) and ZigBee (2005) enjoy significant attention in the community. However, TinySec achieves low energy consumption by reducing the level of security provided. In contrast, ZigBee enjoys high security, but suffers from high energy consumption. MiniSec is a secure network layer that obtains the best of both worlds: low energy consumption and high security. MiniSec has two operating modes, one tailored for single-source communication, and another tailored for multi-source broadcast communication. The latter does not require per-sender state for replay protection and thus scales to large networks. We present a publicly available implementation of MiniSec for the Telos platform, and experimental results demonstrate our low energy utilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379708/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9682992","publicationDate":"April 2007","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379708/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"MiniSec: A Secure Sensor Network Communication Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MiniSec: A Secure Sensor Network Communication Architecture","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPSN-00-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128709S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379651","isNumber":"4379652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379651","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4379652","articleId":"4379708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4379710,"authors":[{"name":"Wenyuan Xu","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ"],"firstName":"Wenyuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278557200"},{"name":"Wade Trappe","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ"],"firstName":"Wade","lastName":"Trappe","id":"37266719100"},{"name":"Yanyong Zhang","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ"],"firstName":"Yanyong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279961200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-59593-638-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4379710","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Jamming","Testing","Electromagnetic interference","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Switches","Permission","Communication switching","Relays","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","interference (signal)","multiplexing","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel surfing","wireless sensor networks","signal interference","channel assignments","network connectivity","coordinated channel switching","spectral multiplexing","asynchronous strategies","spectral scheduling","improved network fidelity","system-oriented approach","Mica2 sensor nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","Reliability","Experimentation","Jamming","Radio Interference","Channel Surfing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379710","abstract":"Wireless sensor networks are susceptible to interference that can disrupt sensor communication. In order to cope with this disruption, we explore channel surfing, whereby the sensor nodes adapt their channel assignments to restore network connectivity in the presence of interference. We explore two different approaches to channel surfing: coordinated channel switching, where the entire sensor network adjusts its channel; and spectral multiplexing, where nodes in a jammed region switch channels while nodes on the boundary of a jammed region act as radio relays between different spectral zones. For spectral multiplexing, we have devised both synchronous and asynchronous strategies to facilitate the spectral scheduling needed to improve network fidelity when sensor nodes operate on multiple channels. In designing these algorithms, we have taken a system-oriented approach that has focused on exploring actual implementation issues under realistic network settings. We have implemented these proposed methods on a testbed of 30 Mica2 sensor nodes, and the experimental results show that these strategies can each repair network connectivity in the presence of interference without introducing significant overhead.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2007.4379710","startPage":"499","endPage":"508","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4379651/4379652/04379710.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 6th International Symposium on Information Processing in Sensor Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Surfing: Defending Wireless Sensor Networks from Interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Channel Surfing: Defending Wireless Sensor Networks from Interference","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379710/","accessionNumber":"9696804","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379710/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Surfing: Defending Wireless Sensor Networks from Interference","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"IPSN-00-58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111515S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4379651","isNumber":"4379652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4379651","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4379652","articleId":"4379710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACMIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4379737,"authors":[{"name":"Albert J.

The creation of the hot spots is independent of technology, architecture, sensor type, or sensor vendor, and it is observed in charge-coupled devices as well as in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensors.

We first decompose the video into foreground and background. A low-level coarse segmentation of the foreground is then used to generate a simple graph representation. A vertex in the graph represents the \"appearance\" of a corresponding segment in the foreground, while the relationship between two segments is encoded by an edge between the corresponding vertices. This provides a simple yet powerful and general representation of the foreground, which can be very useful in problems such as people detection and tracking. We illustrate the effectiveness of this model using an \"example based query\" type of application for people matching in videos. Matching results are provided in multiple-camera situations and also under occlusion.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379759","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379738/04379759.pdf","startPage":"V - 37","endPage":"V - 40","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Graph-Based Foreground Representation and its Application in Example Based People Matching in Video","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Graph-Based Foreground Representation and its Application in Example Based People Matching in Video","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4379759/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820842","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379759/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Graph-Based Foreground Representation and its Application in Example Based People Matching in Video","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-5-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048088S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4379738","articleId":"4379759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379768,"authors":[{"name":"Uk Jang","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Center for Information Technology, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Uk","lastName":"Jang","id":"37397489400"},{"name":"Hyungkeuk Lee","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Center for Information Technology, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungkeuk","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292579400"},{"name":"Sanghoon Lee","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Center for Information Technology, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sanghoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281133200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379768","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Land mobile radio cellular systems","OFDM","Interference","Throughput","Wireless networks","Downlink","Static VAr compensators","Resource management","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","entropy codes","frequency division multiple access","multimedia communication","OFDM modulation","video coding","visual communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal carrier loading","visual entropy maximization","OFDMA cellular networks","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","wireless multimedia","higher quality video application","cross-layer optimization","downlink video transmission","ICI","intercell interference","channel throughput","layered coding algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer Optimization","OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)","Loading Ratio","SVC (Scalable Video Coding)","Visual Entropy"]}],"abstract":"Explosively increasing demands for the wireless multimedia data have accelerated to research for adapting higher quality video applications in extensive efforts.

The algorithm models these smooth regions using piecewise-linear functions and sharp edges by a straight line. To define the area of support for each modeling function, we employ a quadtree decomposition that divides the image into blocks of variable size, each block being approximated by one modeling function containing one or two surfaces. The subdivision of the quadtree and the selection of the type of modeling function is optimized such that a global rate-distortion trade-off is realized. Additionally, we present a predictive coding scheme that improves the coding performance of the quadtree decomposition by exploiting the correlation between each block of the quadtree. Experimental results show that the described technique improves the resulting quality of compressed depth images by 1.5-4 dB when compared to a JPEG-2000 encoder.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379738/04379776.pdf","startPage":"V - 105","endPage":"V - 108","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth-Image Compression Based on an R-D Optimized Quadtree Decomposition for the Transmission of Multiview Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Rendering (computer graphics)","Video compression","Predictive coding","Transform coding","Cameras","Layout","Video coding","Pixel","Piecewise linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","quadtrees","rate distortion theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth-image compression","quadtree decomposition","multiview images transmission","depth-image coding algorithm","piecewise-linear functions","rate-distortion","predictive coding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stereo vision","image coding","geometric modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Depth-Image Compression Based on an R-D Optimized Quadtree Decomposition for the Transmission of Multiview Images","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4379776/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820850","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth-Image Compression Based on an R-D Optimized Quadtree Decomposition for the Transmission of Multiview Images","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-5-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066894S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4379738","articleId":"4379776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379779,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Yeol Kim","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Yeol","lastName":"Kim","id":"37598029700"},{"name":"Yo-Sung Ho","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Korea"],"firstName":"Yo-Sung","lastName":"Ho","id":"37289814300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379779","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":321},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video compression","Layout","Image coding","Automatic voltage control","Rendering (computer graphics)","Color","Mesh generation","Surface texture","Video coding","Erbium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","decomposition","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mesh-based depth coding","3D video coder","hierarchical decomposition","depth maps","layer descriptor","H.264-AVC","advanced video coding","disjoint images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mesh-based depth coding","hierarchical decomposition","3D video","H.264/AVC"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new coding scheme for depth maps using a hierarchical decomposition.

Invariant subspace analysis (ISA) is used to extract features from the video, and the time-evolving properties of these features are modeled via an infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM), which is trained using \"normal\"/\"typical\" video data. The iHMM automatically determines the proper number of HMM states, and it retains a full posterior density function on all model parameters. Anomalies (unusual events) are detected subsequently if a low likelihood is observed when associated sequential features are submitted to the trained iHMM. A hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) framework is employed in the formulation of the iHMM. The evaluation of posterior distributions for the iHMM is achieved in two ways: via MCMC and using a variational Bayes (VB) formulation.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379784","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379738/04379784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379738","startPage":"V - 137","endPage":"V - 140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Infinite Hidden Markov Models and ISA Features for Unusual-Event Detection in Video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Infinite Hidden Markov Models and ISA Features for Unusual-Event Detection in Video","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379784/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820856","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4379784/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Infinite Hidden Markov Models and ISA Features for Unusual-Event Detection in Video","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-5-46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043232S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","xplore-issue":"4379738","articleId":"4379784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4379794,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshihiro Watanabe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiro","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37277581700"},{"name":"Takashi Komuro","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Komuro","id":"37270845100"},{"name":"Masatoshi Ishikawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Ishikawa","id":"37276508700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379794","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Sensor arrays","Image processing","Information analysis","Coprocessors","Real time systems","Performance analysis","Data mining","Throughput","Image converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","feature extraction","image recognition","object recognition","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed vision system","moment-based analysis","visual information processing","geometric features","invariant features","image-plane transformations","object recognition","high-speed image processing","massively parallel co-processor","moment extraction","object-parallel calculation method","pixel-parallel calculation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Moment","Real-time image processing","Vision system","Massively parallel processor","High-frame-rate imaging"]}],"abstract":"We describe a high-speed vision system for real-time applications, which is capable of processing visual information at a frame rate of 1 kfps, including both imaging and processing.

This scheme gives rise to exhaustive computations (search) in the coding procedure. To reduce the computational load of the inter-mode search at the inter-frame, we propose a new inter-mode determination algorithm based on the rate-distortion (RD) cost of the neighborhood MB that is tracked for the current MB in the previous frame.

One application scenario is to integrate it in an H.264 encoder so that the encoder can estimate the decoding complexity and choose the best inter prediction mode to meet the complexity constraint of the target decoding platform.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379828","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379738/04379828.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379738","startPage":"V - 313","endPage":"V - 316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity Modeling for Motion Compensation in H.264/AVC Decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Complexity Modeling for Motion Compensation in H.264/AVC Decoder","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379828/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820889","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4379828/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity Modeling for Motion Compensation in H.264/AVC Decoder","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-5-90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096439S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4379738","articleId":"4379828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4379845,"authors":[{"name":"Alptekin Temizel","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, M.E.T.U., Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Alptekin","lastName":"Temizel","id":"37393040900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379845","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Wavelet domain","Hidden Markov models","Wavelet transforms","Image reconstruction","Wavelet coefficients","Image edge detection","Frequency estimation","Gaussian distribution","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","image enhancement","image reconstruction","image resolution","probability","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution enhancement","wavelet domain hidden Markov tree","Gaussian mixture model","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image resolution","wavelet transforms","image processing","image enhancement"]}],"abstract":"Image resolution enhancement using wavelets is a relatively new subject and many new algorithms have been proposed recently. These algorithms assume that the low resolution image is the approximation subband of a higher resolution image and attempts to estimate the unknown detail coefficients to reconstruct a high resolution image. A subset of these recent approaches utilized probabilistic models to estimate these unknown coefficients. Particularly, hidden Markov tree (HMT) based methods using Gaussian mixture models have been shown to produce promising results. However, one drawback of these methods is that, as the Gaussian is symmetrical around zero, signs of the coefficients generated using this distribution function are inherently random, adversely affecting the resulting image quality. In this paper, we demonstrate that, sign information is an important element affecting the results and propose a method to estimate signs of these coefficients more accurately.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Resolution Enhancement using Wavelet Domain Hidden Markov Tree and Coefficient Sign Estimation","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379845","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379738/04379845.pdf","startPage":"V - 381","endPage":"V - 384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","displayDocTitle":"Image Resolution Enhancement using Wavelet Domain Hidden Markov Tree and Coefficient Sign Estimation","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4379845/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832091","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Resolution Enhancement using Wavelet Domain Hidden Markov Tree and Coefficient Sign Estimation","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-5-107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053979S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4379738","articleId":"4379845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4379855,"authors":[{"name":"Isabelle Begin","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Machines, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Isabelle","lastName":"Begin","id":"37270710500"},{"name":"Frank P.

Furthermore, one-second processing time using desktop computers on several 256 times 256 times 145 datacubes is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379964","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379927/04379964.pdf","startPage":"IV - 101","endPage":"IV - 104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via SVDD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379964/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via SVDD","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9832075","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379964/","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection via SVDD","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-4-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05264S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4379927","articleId":"4379964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4379981,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Rozell","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Rozell","id":"37395723500"},{"name":"Don Johnson","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, USA"],"firstName":"Don","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37275766500"},{"name":"Richard Baraniuk","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, Rice University, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Baraniuk","id":"37270365800"},{"name":"Bruno Olshausen","affiliation":["Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Olshausen","id":"37945057500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1436-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1437-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"}],"articleNumber":"4379981","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":663},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Greedy algorithms","Dictionaries","Hardware","Image coding","Matching pursuit algorithms","Image reconstruction","Cost function","Noise reduction","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","greedy algorithms","image reconstruction","image sequences","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["locally competitive algorithms","sparse approximation algorithms","greedy algorithms","erratic temporal coefficient sequences","reconstruction MSE","coefficient cost function","dynamical system","video sequence coefficients","image coding","video coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximation methods","visual system","image coding","video coding","nonlinear systems"]}],"abstract":"Practical sparse approximation algorithms (particularly greedy algorithms) suffer two significant drawbacks: they are difficult to implement in hardware, and they are inefficient for time-varying stimuli (e.g., video) because they produce erratic temporal coefficient sequences. We present a class of locally competitive algorithms (LCAs) that correspond to a collection of sparse approximation principles minimizing a weighted combination of reconstruction MSE and a coefficient cost function. These systems use thresholding functions to induce local nonlinear competitions in a dynamical system. Simple analog hardware can implement the required nonlinearities and competitions. We show that our LCAs are stable under normal operating conditions and can produce sparsity levels comparable to existing methods. Additionally, these LCAs can produce coefficients for video sequences that are more regular (i.e., smoother and more predictable) than the coefficients produced by greedy algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379981","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4378863/4379927/04379981.pdf","startPage":"IV - 169","endPage":"IV - 172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2007.4379981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4379927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally Competitive Algorithms for Sparse Approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4379981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4379981/","displayDocTitle":"Locally Competitive Algorithms for Sparse Approximation","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9820762","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4379981/","conferenceDate":"16 Sept.-19 Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally Competitive Algorithms for Sparse Approximation","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ICIP-4-54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047821S","chronDate":"Sept. 16 2007-Oct. 19 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4378863","isNumber":"4379927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4378863","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4379927","articleId":"4379981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"}]
