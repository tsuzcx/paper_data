The vehicle for this is an FSS for generating circularly polarized signals from an incident linearly polarized signal at normal incidence to the structure. Principal issues and fabrication processes involved from the initial design of the core FSS structures to be made and tested through to their final testing are addressed. Measured and simulated results for crossed and ring slot element shapes in single and double layer polarization convertor structures are presented for sub-mm wave operation. It is shown that 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidths of 21% can be achieved with the one layer perforated screen design and that the rate of change is lower than the double layer structures. An insertion loss of 1.1 dB can be achieved for the split circular ring double layer periodic array. These results are shown to be compatible with the more specialized fabrication equipment dry reactive ion etching approach previously used for the construction of this type of structure.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2158973","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5970251/05871277.pdf","startPage":"3103","endPage":"3106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2158973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-mm Wet Etched Linear to Circular Polarization FSS Based Polarization Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871277/","displayDocTitle":"Sub-mm Wet Etched Linear to Circular Polarization FSS Based Polarization Converters","volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205161","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5871277/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-mm Wet Etched Linear to Circular Polarization FSS Based Polarization Converters","sourcePdf":"tap-fusco-2158973-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063553S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5970251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5970251","articleId":"5871277","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871278,"authors":[{"name":"David Gonzalez-Ovejero","affiliation":["ICTEAM Institute, Electrical Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gonzalez-Ovejero","id":"38274491300"},{"name":"Christophe Craeye","affiliation":["ICTEAM Institute, Electrical Engineering Department, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Craeye","id":"37267353500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5871278","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":686},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871278","abstract":"An efficient method-of-moments (MoM) technique for analyzing non-periodic antenna arrays of identical elements with fixed orientation is presented. The proposed method, which uses macro basis functions (MBFs), is based on a compact representation of the interactions between MBFs. These interactions are expressed via a low-order harmonic-polynomial function after an explicit pre-computation of the reaction integrals in a very limited set of relative positions. This is possible for arrays of arbitrary size thanks to three transformations- subtraction of the far-field expression for the interactions, phase correction and modified radial distance- applied successively to the pre-computed interactions. After obtaining the harmonic-polynomial expressions, the computation time for the reaction integral between two MBFs is independent from the complexity of the antenna array element.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2158947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970251","startPage":"3117","endPage":"3122","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5970251/05871278.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2158947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolatory Macro Basis Functions Analysis of Non-Periodic Arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Moment methods","Approximation methods","Complexity theory","Wideband","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","method of moments","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolatory macrobasis function analysis","method of moments","MoM technique","nonperiodic antenna arrays","low-order harmonic polynomial function","transformation subtraction","phase correction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Baselines","macro basis functions (MBFs)","method of moments (MoM)","non-periodic arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Interpolatory Macro Basis Functions Analysis of Non-Periodic Arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871278/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5871278/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12205162","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolatory Macro Basis Functions Analysis of Non-Periodic Arrays","sourcePdf":"tap-gonzalezovejero-2158947-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069539S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5970251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5970251","articleId":"5871278","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5871280,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed F.

This predictive system of equations has also been extended and validated for the M24 and FV24 integral-based high-order FDTD algorithms. With this approach, the task of selecting optimum CPML parameters that would usually take several days of intense computations can now be accomplished within a few minutes on an average personal computer.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2158955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5970251/05871280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2158955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970251","startPage":"2933","endPage":"2942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Field PML Optimization for Low and High Order FDTD Algorithms Using Closed-Form Predictive Equations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-Field PML Optimization for Low and High Order FDTD Algorithms Using Closed-Form Predictive Equations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205164","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5871280/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Field PML Optimization for Low and High Order FDTD Algorithms Using Closed-Form Predictive Equations","sourcePdf":"tap-hadi-2158955-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085046S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5970251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5970251","articleId":"5871280","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871283,"authors":[{"name":"Taehyoun Oh","affiliation":["University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5959263/5871283/5871283-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taehyoun Oh (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Of the many variations on the basic formulation, conventional orthogonal schemes remain prevalent because of their high level of accuracy and relative ease of implementation. Inaccuracies do persist, however, and in this paper a simple, computationally efficient remedy to an error that occurs when simulating waves that impinge on a material interface is identified. The detail of when and how the error occurs is illustrated using a simplistic interface scenario, with an analytic electric field being used to drive a single FDTD magnetic field update step. The resulting FDTD approximations are compared to the analytic solution to reveal the extent of the error. The proposed modification is then introduced and its remedial effect shown by repeating the above comparison using the modified FDTD equations. The broader effects of the proposed modification are demonstrated using a practical, 3D, full-wave FDTD forward modeling tool, taking scenario examples from the application area of ground penetrating radar (GPR). It is concluded that the overall accuracy of conventional, orthogonal FDTD schemes is improved, without unduly increasing their computational burden or algorithmic complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Accuracy of FDTD Approximations to Tangential Components of the Coupled Electric and Magnetic Fields at a Material Interface","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2158975","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5970251/05871287.pdf","startPage":"2924","endPage":"2932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2158975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Accuracy of FDTD Approximations to Tangential Components of the Coupled Electric and Magnetic Fields at a Material Interface","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5871287/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205167","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Accuracy of FDTD Approximations to Tangential Components of the Coupled Electric and Magnetic Fields at a Material Interface","sourcePdf":"tap-millington-2158975-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059622S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5970251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5970251","articleId":"5871287","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871288,"authors":[{"name":"Bart De Vuyst","affiliation":["Electronics and Information Systems Department, Ghent University (Ghent), Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5959263/5871288/5871288-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bart De Vuyst was born in Oudenaarde, Belgium, in 1984.

Moreover, in such a modulator, the PWM carrier is generated by a self-oscillation mode that is deliberately introduced. In our approach, this self-oscillation is accurately controlled by a digital delay in the feedback loop. The concept is elaborated for a second-order self-oscillating \u03a3\u0394 modulator with 5-MHz bandwidth. Here, the clock frequency equals 850 MHz, but the loop only has to process signals that are maximally at the self-oscillation frequency (at 106.25 MHz). An additional key element in this design is the use of a feedback FIRDAC which reduces the jitter sensitivity and further relaxes the slewing requirements of the first opamp in the loop. The prototype modulator is fabricated in a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process and achieves a dynamic range of 66 dB.

With their high sensitivity and high dynamic range requirements, the RF circuits have long had a good excuse to avoid any possible source of digital switching activity. With the constant scaling of CMOS feature size and the merciless push for integration, the existence of almost free and powerful digital logic could not go unnoticed. Hence, the environment was ripe to transform the RF functions into digital realizations, as well as to apply digital assistance to help with the performance of RF circuits. This paper revisits the digitization journey of the traditional charge-pump PLL that has resulted in an all-digital frequency synthesizer with the best-in-class RF performance while occupying only a fraction of the silicon area and consuming a fraction of the power. The paper also offers a few novel techniques to further improve area, current consumption, testability, and reliability of frequency synthesizers.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2150890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5934463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2150890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5934463/05871320.pdf","startPage":"1497","endPage":"1510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State-of-the-Art and Future Directions of High-Performance All-Digital Frequency Synthesis in Nanometer CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"State-of-the-Art and Future Directions of High-Performance All-Digital Frequency Synthesis in Nanometer CMOS","volume":"58","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5871320/","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12092986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871320/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State-of-the-Art and Future Directions of High-Performance All-Digital Frequency Synthesis in Nanometer CMOS","sourcePdf":"tcsi-staszewski-2150890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167424S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5934463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5934463","articleId":"5871320","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5871322,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety and the Center of Intelligent Systems and Renewable Energy, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Song","id":"37856907900"},{"name":"Yong-duan Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety and the Center of Intelligent Systems and Renewable Energy, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong-duan","lastName":"Song","id":"37293365200"},{"name":"Tao Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Tang","id":"37575062000"},{"name":"Bin Ning","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, BJTU, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Ning","id":"37948118100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1524-9050"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0016"}],"articleNumber":"5871322","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1152},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society","url":"http://sites.ieee.org/itss/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rail transportation","Position control","Control design","Adaptive control","Aerodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","aerodynamics","braking","control system synthesis","impact (mechanical)","numerical analysis","position control","railways","robust control","tracking","traction","vehicle dynamics","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position control","velocity tracking control","high-speed trains","computationally inexpensive tracking control","resistive friction","aerodynamic drag forces","interactive impacts","nonlinear traction-braking notche","multiple point mass","single coordinate dynamic model","transient impacts","resistive impacts","computationally inexpensive robust adaptive control design","optimal task distribution","aerodynamic resistance","mechanical resistance","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Input saturation","optimal distribution","robust adaptive control","transient impacts"]}],"abstract":"The problem of the position and velocity tracking control of high-speed trains becomes interesting yet challenging when simultaneously considering inevitable factors such as the resistive friction and aerodynamic drag forces, the interactive impacts among the vehicles, and the nonlinear traction/braking notches inherent in train systems.

It is shown that the proposed method is not only robust to external disturbances, aerodynamic resistance, mechanical resistance, and transient impacts but adaptive to unknown system parameters as well. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is also confirmed through numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2143409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6082048/05871322.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2143409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082048","startPage":"1116","endPage":"1125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally Inexpensive Tracking Control of High-Speed Trains With Traction/Braking Saturation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computationally Inexpensive Tracking Control of High-Speed Trains With Traction/Braking Saturation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388557","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally Inexpensive Tracking Control of High-Speed Trains With Traction/Braking Saturation","sourcePdf":"tits-song-2143409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046307S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6082048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"87","articleId":"5871322","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5871324,"authors":[{"name":"Gongjun Yan","affiliation":["Science, Mathematics, and Informatics Department, Indiana University, Kokomo, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6082048/5871324/5871324-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gongjun Yan received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA.","He is currently an Assistant Professor in informatics with Indiana University, Kokomo.

Because of the very dynamic nature of Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) and the short transmission range mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), individual communication links come into existence and vanish unpredictably, making the task of establishing and maintaining routing paths between fast-moving vehicles very challenging. The main contribution of this work is to investigate the probability distribution of the lifetime of individual links in a VANET under the combined assumptions of a realistic radio transmission model and a realistic probability distribution model of intervehicle headway distance.

In addition, they would be essential in developing local and global control schemes aimed at enhancing system stability and reliability. In this paper, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) technique for dynamic state estimation of a synchronous machine using phasor measurement unit (PMU) quantities is developed. The simulation results of the EKF approach show the accuracy of the resulting state estimates. However, the traditional EKF method requires that all externally observed variables, including input signals, be measured or available, which may not always be the case.

As a result, the extended Kalman filter with unknown inputs, referred to as EKF-UI, is proposed for identifying and estimating the states and the unknown inputs of the synchronous machine simultaneously. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the EKF-UI method under noisy or fault conditions, compared to the classic EKF approach and confirms its great potential in cases where there is no access to the input signals of the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871327/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","volume":"26","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"12301764","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic State Estimation in Power System by Applying the Extended Kalman Filter With Unknown Inputs to Phasor Measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic State Estimation in Power System by Applying the Extended Kalman Filter With Unknown Inputs to Phasor Measurements","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ghahremani-2145396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118374S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","isNumber":"6048014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"286","articleId":"5871327","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5871328,"authors":[{"name":"Pukar Mahat","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/5993785/5871328/5871328-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pukar Mahat (M'11) received the B.Eng. degree from Kathmandu University, Nepal, in 2003, in electrical engineering, the M.Eng degree in electrical engineering from Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Aalborg University, Denmark, in 2010, respectively.","He was Research Associate at Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand.

However, overcurrent protection of an islanded distribution system is still an issue due to the difference in fault current when the distribution system is connected to the grid and when it is islanded. This paper proposes the use of adaptive protection, using local information, to overcome the challenges of the overcurrent protection in distribution systems with distributed generation. The trip characteristics of the relays are updated by detecting operating states (grid connected or island) and the faulted section. The paper also proposes faulted section detection using time overcurrent characteristics of the protective relays. Simulation results show that the operating state and faulted section can be correctly identified and the protection system settings can be updated to clear the faults faster.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5993785/05871328.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2149550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2149550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5993785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Adaptive Overcurrent Protection of Distribution Systems With Distributed Generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Circuit faults","Fault currents","Generators","Adaptive systems","Distributed power generation","Wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","overcurrent protection","power distribution protection","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive overcurrent protection","distribution systems","distributed generation","islanded mode","islanded distribution system","fault current","protective relays","faulted section detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive protection","distributed generation","islanding","time overcurrent protection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Adaptive Overcurrent Protection of Distribution Systems With Distributed Generation","volume":"2","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5871328/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12190328","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Adaptive Overcurrent Protection of Distribution Systems With Distributed Generation","sourcePdf":"tsg-mahat-2149550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079401S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5993785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"280","xplore-issue":"5993785","articleId":"5871328","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871329,"authors":[{"name":"O.

A stand-alone battery system might not be sufficient to satisfy peak power demand and transient load variations in hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV, PHEV). Active battery/ultracapacitor hybrid ESS provides a better solution in terms of efficient power management and control flexibility. Moreover, the voltage of the battery pack can be selected to be different than that of the ultracapacitor, which will result in flexibility of design as well as cost and size reduction of the battery pack. In addition, the ultracapacitor bank can supply or recapture a large burst of power and it can be used with high C-rates. Hence, the battery is not subjected to supply peak and sharp power variations, and the stress on the battery will be reduced and the battery lifetime would be increased. Utilizing ultracapacitor results in effective capturing of the braking energy, especially in sudden braking conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2011.2150250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/6155182/05871329.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2011.2150250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Integrated Magnetic Structure Based DC/DC Converter for Hybrid Battery/Ultracapacitor Energy Storage Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871329/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Integrated Magnetic Structure Based DC/DC Converter for Hybrid Battery/Ultracapacitor Energy Storage Systems","volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543416","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5871329/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Integrated Magnetic Structure Based DC/DC Converter for Hybrid Battery/Ultracapacitor Energy Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"tsg-onar-2150250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173292S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6155182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6155182","articleId":"5871329","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871331,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Tao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5937482/5871331/5871331-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Tao Zhang was born in Shaanxi, China.

Being based on a subset of packets, they introduce estimation errors that have to be properly counteracted by using a fine tuning of the sampling strategy and sophisticated inversion methods. This problem has been deeply investigated in the literature with particular attention to the statistical properties of packet sampling and to the recovery of the original network measurements. Herein, we propose a novel approach to predict the energy of the sampling error in the real time estimation of traffic bitrate, based on spectral analysis in the frequency domain. We start by demonstrating that the error introduced by packet sampling can be modeled as an aliasing effect in the frequency domain. Then, we derive closed-form expressions for the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to predict the distortion of traffic bitrate estimates over time. The accuracy of the proposed SNR metric is validated by means of real packet traces. Furthermore, a comparison with respect to an analogous SNR expression derived using classic stochastic tools is proposed, showing that the frequency domain approach grants for a higher accuracy when traffic rate measurements are carried out at fine time granularity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Bit rate","Monitoring","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","sampling methods","spectral analysis","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral models","bitrate measurement","packet sampled traffic","network measurement systems","packet sampling techniques","estimation errors","inversion methods","spectral analysis","signal-to-noise ratio","distortion prediction","SNR metric","Internet measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Packet sampling","internet measurements","spectral models"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2011.050311.100035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4275028/5871348/05871354.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5871348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2011.050311.100035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Models for Bitrate Measurement from Packet Sampled Traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Models for Bitrate Measurement from Packet Sampled Traffic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871354/","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5871354/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12047193","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Models for Bitrate Measurement from Packet Sampled Traffic","sourcePdf":"141-tnsm1102-grieco.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07615S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"5871348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5871348","articleId":"5871354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5871400,"authors":[{"name":"Basak Eraslan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Basak","lastName":"Eraslan","id":"38017044900"},{"name":"Didem Gozupek","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Didem","lastName":"Gozupek","id":"37828735200"},{"name":"Fatih Alagoz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Fatih","lastName":"Alagoz","id":"37299054200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5871400","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1035},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Cognitive radio","Throughput","Optimization","Games","Dynamic scheduling","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auction theory based algorithm","throughput maximizing scheduling","centralized cognitive radio networks","centralized base station","first-price sealed bid auction mechanism","time slot pairs","cognitive user","optimization software CPLEX values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Auction algorithm","first price sealed bid auction","resource allocation","scheduling","dynamic spectrum access","cognitive radio networks"]}],"abstract":"In this letter we propose an auction theory based algorithm for throughput maximizing scheduling in centralized cognitive radio networks (CRN).

The feature extraction, speaker modeling and system classification are discussed. Evaluations of speaker identification performance subject to environmental noise are presented. While performance is impressive in clean speech conditions, there is rapid degradation with mismatched additive noise. Missing data methods can compensate against arbitrary disturbances and remove environmental mismatches. An overview of missing data methods is provided and applications to robust speaker identification summarized. Finally combined approaches involving bottom-up estimation and top-down processing are reviewed, and their significance discussed.","doi":"10.1109/MCAS.2011.941079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5871467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCAS.2011.941079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/7384/5871467/05871484.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"61","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overview of Speaker Identification: Accuracy and Robustness Issues","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Overview of Speaker Identification: Accuracy and Robustness Issues","volume":"11","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5871484/","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2011","accessionNumber":"12047705","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871484/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overview of Speaker Identification: Accuracy and Robustness Issues","sourcePdf":"11mcas02-togneri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183782S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"5871467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"5871467","articleId":"5871484","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":5871538,"authors":[{"name":"Devendra Dilip Potnis","affiliation":["School of Information Sciences, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Devendra Dilip potnis is Assistant Professor in the School of Information Sciences, University of Tennessee, Suite 442 Communications Bldg., 1345 Circle Park, Knoxville, TN 37996; dpotnis@utk.edu."]},"firstName":"Devendra Dilip","lastName":"Potnis","id":"38017045200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0097"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-416X"}],"articleNumber":"5871538","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":755},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology","url":"http://www.ieeessit.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular phones","Mobile communication","Gender issues","Employment","Career development","Employment","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consumer behaviour","customer services","gender issues","market opportunities","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cell phone enabled empowerment","information technology","Wal-Mart","communication channel","customer services","consumer surveys","people earning","market surveys","socioeconomic effects"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MTS.2011.941327","endPage":"45","startPage":"39","publicationTitle":"IEEE Technology and Society Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Technology and Society Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/44/5871524/05871538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MTS.2011.941327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5871524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell-Phone-Enabled Empowerment of Woman Earning Less than $1/Day","abstract":"Cell phones are the fastest spreading information technology (IT) in the developing world, with a penetration rate of over 61%.

Special attention is given to a problem often neglected: missing data in one or more modalities. In offline evaluation the issue can be easily solved by excluding those parts of the corpus where one or more channels are corrupted or not suitable for evaluation. In real applications, however, we cannot neglect the challenge of missing data and have to find adequate ways to handle it. To address this, we do not expect examined data to be completely available at all time in our experiments. The presented system solves the problem at the multimodal fusion stage, so various ensemble techniques-covering established ones as well as rather novel emotion specific approaches-will be explained and enriched with strategies on how to compensate for temporarily unavailable modalities. We will compare and discuss advantages and drawbacks of fusion categories and extensive evaluation of mentioned techniques is carried out on the CALLAS Expressivity Corpus, featuring facial, vocal, and gestural modalities.","doi":"10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6129448","startPage":"206","endPage":"218","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165369/6129448/05871582.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Fusion Methods for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Missing Data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emotion recognition","Speech processing","Feature extraction","Speech recognition","Face recognition","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emotion recognition","face recognition","sensor fusion","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fusion method","multimodal emotion recognition","ensemble-based system","ensemble technique","CALLAS Expressivity corpus","missing data","facial modality","vocal modality","gestural modality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ensemble based systems","decision-level fusion","multimodal emotion recognition","missing data."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Fusion Methods for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Missing Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5871582/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12461065","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Fusion Methods for Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Missing Data","sourcePdf":"tta2011040206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096126S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"6129448","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6129448","articleId":"5871582","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5871588,"authors":[{"name":"Turbo Majumder","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6189397/5871588/5871588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Turbo Majumder received the BTech (Hons.) degree in electronics and electrical communication engineering and MTech degree in automation and computer vision, both from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 2005.

This reduces the breakpoint median problem to one of solving multiple instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is a classical NP-complete problem in graph theory. Exponential time algorithms that apply efficient runtime heuristics, such as branch-and-bound, to dynamically prune the search space are used to solve TSP. In this paper, we present the design and performance evaluation of a network-on-chip (NoC)-based implementation for solving TSP under the bounded edge-weight model, as used in the computation of breakpoint phylogeny. Our approach takes advantage of fine-grain parallelism from the multiple processing elements (PEs) and uses efficient NoC architecture for inter-PE communication. To accelerate the application on hardware, our PE design optimizes a particular lower bound calculation operation which typically tends to be the serial bottleneck in computation of a TSP solution. We also explore two representative NoC architectures-mesh and quad-tree-and show that the latter is more energy-efficient for this application domain. Experimental results show that this new implementation is able to achieve speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art multithreaded software implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12690227","htmlLink":"/document/5871588/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"NoC-Based Hardware Accelerator for Breakpoint Phylogeny","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NoC-Based Hardware Accelerator for Breakpoint Phylogeny","sourcePdf":"ttc2012060857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067665S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6189397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6189397","articleId":"5871588","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5871594,"authors":[{"name":"Vin-sen Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6142500/5871594/5871594-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vin-sen Feng received the BS degree in computer science and engineering from National Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2007.

A hierarchical support vector machines (H-SVM) scheme is proposed with the following advantages. First, H-SVM offers an efficient evaluation procedure in a distributed manner due to hierarchical structure. Second, H-SVM could determine these parameters based only on simpler network information, e.g., the hop counts, without requiring particular ranging hardware. Third, the exact mean and the variance of the estimation error introduced by H-SVM are derived which are seldom addressed in previous works. Furthermore, we present a parallel learning algorithm to reduce the computation time required for the proposed H-SVM. Thanks for the quicker matrix diagonization technique, our algorithm can reduce the traditional SVM learning complexity from O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) to O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) where n is the training sample size.

Although RCU updates are relatively heavy weight, the importance of read-side performance is increasing as computing systems become more responsive to changes in their environments. RCU is heavily used in several kernel-level environments. Unfortunately, kernel-level implementations use facilities that are often unavailable to user applications. The few prior user-level RCU implementations either provided inefficient read-side primitives or restricted the application architecture. This paper fills this gap by describing efficient and flexible RCU implementations based on primitives commonly available to user-level applications. Finally, this paper compares these RCU implementations with each other and with standard locking, which enables choosing the best mechanism for a given workload. This work opens the door to widespread user-application use of RCU.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User-Level Implementations of Read-Copy Update","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2011.159","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6112276/05871597.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112276","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871597/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"User-Level Implementations of Read-Copy Update","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5871597/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12426070","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User-Level Implementations of Read-Copy Update","sourcePdf":"ttd2012020375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056764S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6112276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6112276","articleId":"5871597","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5871598,"authors":[{"name":"Fadi N.

While the two paradigms differ in several dimensions, they also share challenges, stemming from the lack of trust between outsourcers and workers. In this work, we propose a unifying trust framework, where correct participation is financially rewarded: neither participant is trusted, yet outsourced computations are efficiently verified and validly remunerated. We propose three solutions for this problem, relying on an offline bank to generate and redeem payments; the bank is oblivious to interactions between outsourcers and workers. We propose several attacks that can be launched against our framework and study the effectiveness of our solutions. We implemented our most secure solution and our experiments show that it is efficient: the bank can perform hundreds of payment transactions per second and the overheads imposed on outsourcers and workers are negligible.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6112276/05871601.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2011.163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2011.163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112276","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Payments for Outsourced Computations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["banking","cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outsourced computation payment","cloud computing","volunteer computing efforts","trust framework","offline bank","outsourcer-worker interaction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed applications","security and privacy protection."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Payments for Outsourced Computations","volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5871601/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12426073","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Payments for Outsourced Computations","sourcePdf":"ttd2012020313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087986S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6112276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6112276","articleId":"5871601","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5871624,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Tung On","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, KLN, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6247403/5871624/5871624-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sai Tung On received the BEng degree in software engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

In this paper, we study how transaction recovery can be efficiently supported in database management systems (dbmss) running on slc flash disks. Inspired by the classical shadow-paging approach, we propose a new commit scheme, called flagcommit, to exploit the unique characteristics of flash disks such as fast random read access, out-place updating, and partial page programming. To minimize the need of writing log records, we embed the transaction status into flash pages through a chain of commit flags. Based on flagcommit, we develop two recovery protocols, namely commit-based flag commit (cfc) and abort-based flag commit (afc), to meet different performance needs. They are flexible to support no-force buffer management and fine-grained concurrency control. Our performance evaluation based on the tpc-c benchmark shows that both cfc and afc outperform the state-of-the-art recovery protocols.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2011.122","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/6247403/05871624.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2011.122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6247403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","startPage":"1624","endPage":"1639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Flag Commit: Supporting Efficient Transaction Recovery in Flash-Based DBMSs","volume":"24","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5871624/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flag Commit: Supporting Efficient Transaction Recovery in Flash-Based DBMSs","sourcePdf":"ttk2012091624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085813S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6247403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6247403","articleId":"5871624","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5871641,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Wu","affiliation":["Microsoft Bing, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5989906/5871641/5871641-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhong Wu received the BS degree in automation from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and the PhD degree in computer science and technology from the Institute for Advanced Study, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2011.

The leading features for face recognition can achieve good retrieval performance, but these features are not suitable for inverted indexing as they are high-dimensional and global and thus not scalable in either computational or storage cost. In this paper, we aim to build a scalable face image retrieval system. For this purpose, we develop a new scalable face representation using both local and global features. In the indexing stage, we exploit special properties of faces to design new component-based local features, which are subsequently quantized into visual words using a novel identity-based quantization scheme. We also use a very small Hamming signature (40 bytes) to encode the discriminative global feature for each face. In the retrieval stage, candidate images are first retrieved from the inverted index of visual words. We then use a new multireference distance to rerank the candidate images using the Hamming signature. On a one millon face database, we show that our local features and global Hamming signatures are complementary-the inverted index based on local features provides candidate images with good recall, while the multireference reranking with global Hamming signature leads to good precision. As a result, our system is not only scalable but also outperforms the linear scan retrieval system using the state-of-the-art face recognition feature in term of the quality.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5989906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5989906/05871641.pdf","startPage":"1991","endPage":"2001","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Face Image Retrieval with Identity-Based Quantization and Multireference Reranking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Face Image Retrieval with Identity-Based Quantization and Multireference Reranking","volume":"33","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5871641/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206234","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","pubMedId":"21646678","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Face Image Retrieval with Identity-Based Quantization and Multireference Reranking","sourcePdf":"ttp2011101991.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081099S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5989906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5989906","articleId":"5871641","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5871642,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Wagner","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University University at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6107461/5871642/5871642-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrew Wagner received the bachelor's degree in general engineering in 2003 and the master's degree in electrical engineering in 2006 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is currently working toward the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering.

This is mostly due to the difficulty of simultaneously handling variations in illumination, image misalignment, and occlusion in the test image. We consider a scenario where the training images are well controlled and test images are only loosely controlled. We propose a conceptually simple face recognition system that achieves a high degree of robustness and stability to illumination variation, image misalignment, and partial occlusion. The system uses tools from sparse representation to align a test face image to a set of frontal training images. The region of attraction of our alignment algorithm is computed empirically for public face data sets such as Multi-PIE. We demonstrate how to capture a set of training images with enough illumination variation that they span test images taken under uncontrolled illumination. In order to evaluate how our algorithms work under practical testing conditions, we have implemented a complete face recognition system, including a projector-based training acquisition system. Our system can efficiently and effectively recognize faces under a variety of realistic conditions, using only frontal images under the proposed illuminations as training.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward a Practical Face Recognition System: Robust Alignment and Illumination by Sparse Representation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.112","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6107461/05871642.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871642/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Toward a Practical Face Recognition System: Robust Alignment and Illumination by Sparse Representation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5871642/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425410","pubMedId":"21646680","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a Practical Face Recognition System: Robust Alignment and Illumination by Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"ttp2012020372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135884S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6107461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"445","xplore-issue":"6107461","articleId":"5871642","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5871643,"authors":[{"name":"Volkmar Frinken","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (IAM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6107461/5871643/5871643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Volkmar Frinken received the MS degree in computer science from the University of Dortmund, Germany, in 2007.

In the present paper, a novel keyword spotting method for handwritten documents is described. It is derived from a neural network-based system for unconstrained handwriting recognition. As such it performs template-free spotting, i.e., it is not necessary for a keyword to appear in the training set. The keyword spotting is done using a modification of the CTC Token Passing algorithm in conjunction with a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that the proposed systems outperform not only a classical dynamic time warping-based approach but also a modern keyword spotting system, based on hidden Markov models. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the underlying neural networks when using them in a recognition task followed by keyword spotting on the produced transcription. We point out the advantages of keyword spotting when compared to classic text line recognition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Word Spotting Method Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.113","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6107461/05871643.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Word Spotting Method Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5871643/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425411","pubMedId":"21646681","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Word Spotting Method Based on Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"ttp2012020211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098347S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6107461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"186","xplore-issue":"6107461","articleId":"5871643","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5871650,"authors":[{"name":"Shoushun Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6107461/5871650/5871650-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shoushun Chen received the BS degree from Peking University, the ME degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the PhD degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2000, 2003, and 2007, respectively.

The detected line features are organized into vectorial segments. After feature extraction, a modified line segment Hausdorff-distance classifier combined with on-the-fly cluster-based size and position invariant categorization. The system can achieve about 90 percent average success rate in the categorization of human postures, while using only a small number of training samples.

The device consists of an electrostatic actuator and two capacitive sensors, capable of acquiring all measurement data (force and displacement) electronically without relying on electron microscopy imaging. This capability avoids the effect of electron beam (e-beam) irradiation during nanomaterial testing. The bulk-microfabricated devices perform electrical characterization at different mechanical strain levels. To integrate individual nanowires to the MEMS device for testing, a nanomanipulation procedure is developed to transfer individual nanowires from their growth substrate to the device inside a scanning electron microscope. Silicon nanowires are characterized using the MEMS device for their piezoresistive as well as mechanical properties. It is also experimentally verified that e-beam irradiation can significantly alter the characterization results and must be avoided during testing.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5968128/05871668.pdf","startPage":"959","endPage":"967","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2011.2153825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2011.2153825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5968128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piezoresistivity Characterization of Synthetic Silicon Nanowires Using a MEMS Device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Piezoresistivity Characterization of Synthetic Silicon Nanowires Using a MEMS Device","htmlLink":"/document/5871668/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205202","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piezoresistivity Characterization of Synthetic Silicon Nanowires Using a MEMS Device","sourcePdf":"jmems-sun-2153825-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.215669S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5968128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"5968128","articleId":"5871668","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5871673,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Lu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves and Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Lu","id":"38023397000"},{"name":"Kwok Wa Leung","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves and Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kwok Wa","lastName":"Leung","id":"37279720400"},{"name":"Yong Mei Pan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves and Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yong Mei","lastName":"Pan","id":"37555555800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5871673","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1847},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectrics","Bandwidth","Antenna measurements","Frequency measurement","Dielectric resonator antennas","Mathematical model","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric resonator antennas","dielectric waveguides","polarisation","rectangular waveguides","telecommunication transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hollow rectangular antenna","dielectric resonator antenna","dielectric waveguide model","transverse transmission line","dielectric constant method","DRA","HFSS simulation","axial ratio bandwidth","circular polarization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular polarization","dielectric resonator antenna (DRA)","dielectric waveguide model (DWM)"]}],"abstract":"For the first time, the dielectric waveguide model (DWM) is used to calculate the resonance frequency of the hollow rectangular dielectric resonator antenna (DRA).

Using this method each antenna element is replaced by a set of infinitesimal dipoles producing the same electric fields of the antenna. The recently introduced Invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm is employed to find the infinitesimal dipole models. The algorithm is applied to a planar inverted F-antenna designed as an element of a compact array for MIMO applications. Using the obtained IDMs, self and mutual admittances between the antennas are predicted. Therefore, correlation coefficients of the MIMO array system are achieved using S-parameters. Having the correlation of the system, the location and orientation of each antenna are optimized to find the minimum correlation value for the MIMO antenna system. Using the optimization technique, very low cross correlation coefficient is obtained for very close antennas over a finite ground plane.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2158976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5970251/05871688.pdf","startPage":"3112","endPage":"3116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2158976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5970251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Array Optimization Using Dipole Models for MIMO Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871688/","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Array Optimization Using Dipole Models for MIMO Applications","volume":"59","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205180","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5871688/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Array Optimization Using Dipole Models for MIMO Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-karimkashi-2158976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089401S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5970251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5970251","articleId":"5871688","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871689,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Caizzone","affiliation":["Antenna Group, Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Space Agency, Wessling, Germany","DISP, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5970251/5871689/5871689-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Caizzone received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata,\u201d in 2009 and is currently part-time working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His main research interests concern small antennas for RFIDs and navigation, antenna arrays and grids with enhanced sensing capabilities.

The nonlinear plant is represented by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy affine dynamic models with norm-bounded uncertainties, and stochastic variables that satisfy the Bernoulli random binary distribution are adopted to characterize the data-missing phenomenon. The objective is to design an admissible output-feedback controller that guarantees the stochastic stability of the resulting closed-loop system with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level. It is assumed that the plant premise variables, which are often the state variables or their functions, are not measurable so that the controller implementation with state-space partition may not be synchronous with the state trajectories of the plant. Based on a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function combined with an S-procedure and some matrix inequality convexifying techniques, two different approaches to robust output-feedback controller design are developed for the underlying T-S fuzzy affine systems with unreliable communication links. The solutions to the problem are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6087321/05871691.pdf","startPage":"1014","endPage":"1030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2159011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2159011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6087321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Output-Feedback Control of Networked Nonlinear Systems With Multiple Packet Dropouts: T\u2013S Fuzzy Affine Model-Based Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","Lyapunov methods","Takagi-Sugeno model","Robustness","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedback","fuzzy control","H\u221e control","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","networked control systems","nonlinear control systems","piecewise linear techniques","robust control","state-space methods","stochastic processes","telecommunication links","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous output-feedback control","networked nonlinear system","multiple packet dropout","T-S fuzzy affine model-based approach","robust H\u221e output-feedback control","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy affine dynamic model","norm-bounded uncertainty","stochastic variable","Bernoulli random binary distribution","data-missing phenomenon","stochastic stability","closed loop system","H\u221e disturbance attenuation level","state-space partition","plant state trajectory","piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function","S-procedure","matrix inequality convexifying technique","unreliable communication link","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networked nonlinear systems","output feedback","piecewise Lyapunov functions","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T\u2013S) fuzzy affine systems","unreliable communication links"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Output-Feedback Control of Networked Nonlinear Systems With Multiple Packet Dropouts: T\u2013S Fuzzy Affine Model-Based Approach","volume":"19","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388795","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Output-Feedback Control of Networked Nonlinear Systems With Multiple Packet Dropouts: T\u2013S Fuzzy Affine Model-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-qiu-2159011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076166S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","isNumber":"6087321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"190","articleId":"5871691","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871692,"authors":[{"name":"Pingli Huang","affiliation":["Texas Analog Center of Excellence (TxACE), University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5959263/5871692/5871692-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pingli Huang (S'06) received the B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2005, and the M.S. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, in 2008, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree, all in electrical engineering.","She was a Visiting Student with the University of Texas at Dallas from November 2010 to May 2011.","Ms. Huang was the recipient of the Outstanding Student Designer Award from Analog Device and the Intel/CICC Student Scholarship Award in 2010."]},"firstName":"Pingli","lastName":"Huang","id":"37600133800"},{"name":"Szukang Hsien","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5959263/5871692/5871692-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Szu-Kang Hsien received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in material science and engineering from Tsing-Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, in 2001.","From 1995 to 1997, he was involved in the study of ultrathin gate\u2013oxide process reliability for deep-submicron CMOS with National Nano Device Laboratories (NDL), Hsinchu, Taiwan.

The loaded BCMC stub can not only introduce the perturbation to affect the \u03bb/2 microstrip resonator acting as a dual-mode resonator, but also provide two transmission zeros to improve the upper passband selectivity and suppress the first odd-mode spurious. Then, to avoid the first even-mode spurious, two microstrip short-stubs are employed to obtain another transmission zero. Meanwhile, two \u03bb/4 I/O feeding-lines are employed to obtain strong passband enhancement around the dual-resonances. To verify the mechanism mentioned above, a bandpass filter is designed. The proposed filter has the merits of low insertion loss, good passband selectivity, wide stopband, flat group delay, and a compact size.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2011.2157232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5937459/05871696.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2011.2157232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937459","startPage":"353","endPage":"355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Bandpass Filter With Wide Stopband Using Loaded BCMC Stub and Short-Stub","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Bandpass Filter With Wide Stopband Using Loaded BCMC Stub and Short-Stub","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"21","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12141553","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5871696/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Bandpass Filter With Wide Stopband Using Loaded BCMC Stub and Short-Stub","sourcePdf":"lmwc-luo-2157232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055167S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5937459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5937459","articleId":"5871696","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871697,"authors":[{"name":"Isar Mostafanezhad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Isar","lastName":"Mostafanezhad","id":"37398471700"},{"name":"Olga Boric-Lubecke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Boric-Lubecke","id":"38277504400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5871697","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":635},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Tuning","Demodulation","Doppler radar","Mixers","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","biomedical electronics","demodulation","demodulators","microwave mixers","patient monitoring","radar receivers","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF based analog linear demodulator","quadrature homodyne receiver","wireless life sign monitoring application","single mixer receiver architecture","phase tuning method","optimum demodulation point","dc offset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC cancellation","life signs","linear demodulation","phase tuning","wireless"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871697","abstract":"Quadrature homodyne receivers have been used extensively for wireless life sign monitoring applications.

Existing modulation classification algorithms include classic likelihood approaches and feature-based approaches. In this study, approximate entropy, a nonlinear method to analyze a time series, is proposed as a unique characteristic of a modulation scheme. It is projected as a robust feature to identify signal parameters such as number of symbol levels, pulse lengths, and modulation indices of a continuous phase modulated (CPM) signal. The method is then extended to classify CPM signals with differing pulse shapes, which include raised cosine and Gaussian pulses with varying roll-off factors and bandwidth-time products, respectively. This approximate entropy feature-based approach results in high classification accuracies for a variety of signals and performs robustly even in the presence of synchronization errors and carrier phase offsets. Results are presented in the form of extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2159000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5983315/05871718.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2159000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983315","startPage":"843","endPage":"852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation Recognition in Continuous Phase Modulation Using Approximate Entropy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modulation Recognition in Continuous Phase Modulation Using Approximate Entropy","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205666","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5871718/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation Recognition in Continuous Phase Modulation Using Approximate Entropy","sourcePdf":"tifs-pawar-2159000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095601S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5983315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5983315","articleId":"5871718","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5871724,"authors":[{"name":"Sushruth N.

LTE uses a pragmatic combination of several techniques to reduce the channel-state feedback that is required by a frequency-domain scheduler. In the subband-level feedback and user-selected subband feedback schemes specified in LTE, the user reduces feedback by reporting only the channel quality that is averaged over groups of resource blocks called subbands. This approach leads to an occasional incorrect determination of rate by the scheduler for some resource blocks. In this paper, we develop closed-form expressions for the throughput achieved by the feedback schemes of LTE. The analysis quantifies the joint effects of three critical components on the overall system throughput-scheduler, multiple-antenna mode, and the feedback scheme-and brings out its dependence on system parameters such as the number of resource blocks per subband and the rate adaptation thresholds. The effect of the coarse subband-level frequency granularity of feedback is captured. The analysis provides an independent theoretical reference and a quick system parameter optimization tool to an LTE system designer and theoretically helps in understanding the behavior of OFDMA feedback reduction techniques when operated under practical system constraints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Performance Analysis of Channel Quality Indicator Feedback Schemes and Frequency-Domain Scheduling for LTE","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2159034","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05871724.pdf","startPage":"3096","endPage":"3109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2159034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint Performance Analysis of Channel Quality Indicator Feedback Schemes and Frequency-Domain Scheduling for LTE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219098","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Performance Analysis of Channel Quality Indicator Feedback Schemes and Frequency-Domain Scheduling for LTE","sourcePdf":"tvt-mehta-2159034-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055355S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"45","articleId":"5871724","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871725,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Chan Oh","affiliation":["Telecommunication Research and Development Center, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5948446/5871725/5871725-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong-Chan Oh (M'09) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Korea Aerospace University (KAU), Goyang, Korea, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently with the Telecommunications R&D Center, Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea, as a Senior Engineer.

How we can mitigate the interference is of great concern for the deployment of femtocells. When the femto base station has perfect channel information, it can mitigate the interference through transmit power control and beamforming. However, it may not be feasible to get perfect channel information due to unavoidable impairments such as channel estimation, quantization, and feedback delay. In the presence of such channel uncertainty, we consider the combined use of transmit power control and beamforming for femtocells in heterogeneous wireless communication environments. By analyzing the effect of channel uncertainty parameters on the performance, we determine the transmit power level to provide the desired signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the indoor cell edge femtouser and the beam weight to maximize the output SINR of the macrousers and femtousers by mitigating interference in a collaborate manner. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme is quite effective in the presence of channel uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2158615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5948446/05871725.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2158615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5948446","startPage":"2545","endPage":"2554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control and Beamforming for Femtocells in the Presence of Channel Uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5871725","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Control and Beamforming for Femtocells in the Presence of Channel Uncertainty","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12157649","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5871725/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Control and Beamforming for Femtocells in the Presence of Channel Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tvt-oh-2158615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117022S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5948446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5948446","articleId":"5871725","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5871726,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas G.

Participants rated each video in terms of the levels of arousal, valence, like/dislike, dominance, and familiarity. For 22 of the 32 participants, frontal face video was also recorded. A novel method for stimuli selection is proposed using retrieval by affective tags from the last.fm website, video highlight detection, and an online assessment tool. An extensive analysis of the participants' ratings during the experiment is presented. Correlates between the EEG signal frequencies and the participants' ratings are investigated. Methods and results are presented for single-trial classification of arousal, valence, and like/dislike ratings using the modalities of EEG, peripheral physiological signals, and multimedia content analysis. Finally, decision fusion of the classification results from different modalities is performed. The data set is made publicly available and we encourage other researchers to use it for testing their own affective state estimation methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5871728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2012","volume":"3","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12653732","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2012","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5871728/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis ;Using Physiological Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis ;Using Physiological Signals","sourcePdf":"tta2012010018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12317S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"6179756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"1416","xplore-issue":"6179756","articleId":"5871728","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5871850,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The directivity patterns are obtained by optimizing a cost function which is a convex combination of a front-back energy ratio and uniformity within a frontal sector of interest. Most of the standard directivity patterns - omnidirectional, cardioid, subcardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid - are particular solutions of this optimization problem with specific values of two free parameters: the angular width of the frontal sector and the convex combination factor. More general solutions of practical use are obtained by varying these two parameters. Many of these optimal directivity patterns are trigonometric polynomials with complex roots. A new differential array structure that enables the implementation of general higher order directivity patterns, with complex or real roots, is then proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed design framework and the implementation structure are illustrated by design examples, simulations, and measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2159204","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6066252/05872011.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6066252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2159204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","startPage":"162","endPage":"174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design and Implementation of Higher Order Differential Microphones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Design and Implementation of Higher Order Differential Microphones","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872011/","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5872011/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12328807","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design and Implementation of Higher Order Differential Microphones","sourcePdf":"tasl-desena-2159204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101364S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6066252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6066252","articleId":"5872011","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5872014,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron J.

One important obstacle is the difficulty of maintaining system usability with socket misalignment. Misalignment inevitably occurs during prosthesis donning and doffing, producing a shift in electrode contact locations. We investigated how the size of the electrode detection surface and the placement of electrode poles (electrode orientation) affected system robustness with electrode shift. Electrodes oriented parallel to muscle fibers outperformed electrodes oriented perpendicular to muscle fibers in both shift and no-shift conditions (p <; 0.01). Another finding was the significant difference (p <; 0.01) in performance for the direction of electrode shift. Shifts perpendicular to the muscle fibers reduced classification accuracy and real-time controllability much more than shifts parallel to the muscle fibers. Increasing the size of the electrode detection surface was found to help reduce classification accuracy sensitivity to electrode shifts in a direction perpendicular to the muscle fibers but did not improve the real-time controllability of the pattern recognition system. One clinically important result was that a combination of longitudinal and transverse electrodes yielded high controllability with and without electrode shift using only four physical electrode pole locations.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2159216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5992870/05872014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2159216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992870","startPage":"2537","endPage":"2544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effects of Electrode Size and Orientation on the Sensitivity of Myoelectric Pattern Recognition Systems to Electrode Shift","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Effects of Electrode Size and Orientation on the Sensitivity of Myoelectric Pattern Recognition Systems to Electrode Shift","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872014/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206153","pubMedId":"21659017","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872014/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effects of Electrode Size and Orientation on the Sensitivity of Myoelectric Pattern Recognition Systems to Electrode Shift","sourcePdf":"tbme-young-2159216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0829S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5992870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"5992870","articleId":"5872014","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5872020,"authors":[{"name":"Shimeng Yu","affiliation":["Center of Integrated Systems and Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5959271/5872020/5872020-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shimeng Yu (S'10) received the B.S. degree from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2009, and the M.S. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2011, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering.","He is the author or a coauthor of one book chapter in Functional Metal Oxide Nanostructures, and more than 30 papers on different topics, including several papers in IEDM, Symposia of VLSI Technology, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, IEEE Electron Device Letters, Applied Physics Letters, Nanotechnology, etc. He also serves as an active reviewer for Applied Physics Letters, Nanotechnology, Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics, Journal of the Electrochemical Society, and Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters.

The property of gradual resistance change by pulse amplitudes was exploited to demonstrate the spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rule, suggesting that metal oxide memory can potentially be used as an electronic synapse device for the emerging neuromorphic computation system.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2011.2147791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5959271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2011.2147791","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5959271/05872020.pdf","startPage":"2729","endPage":"2737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Electronic Synapse Device Based on Metal Oxide Resistive Switching Memory for Neuromorphic Computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Electronic Synapse Device Based on Metal Oxide Resistive Switching Memory for Neuromorphic Computation","volume":"58","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872020/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12120783","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872020/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Electronic Synapse Device Based on Metal Oxide Resistive Switching Memory for Neuromorphic Computation","sourcePdf":"ted-yu-2147791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097957S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5959271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"498","xplore-issue":"5959271","articleId":"5872020","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5872024,"authors":[{"name":"Hae Jong Seo","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6069499/5872024/5872024-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hae Jong Seo (S'07\u2013M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2006, respectively.

In this paper, we formulate an analytical framework for resource allocation in a downlink orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based broadband network with coexistence of secure users (SUs) and normal users (NUs). The SUs require secure data transmission at the physical layer while the NUs are served with conventional best-effort data traffic. The problem is formulated as joint power and subcarrier allocation with the objective of maximizing average aggregate information rate of all NUs while maintaining an average secrecy rate for each individual SU under a total transmit power constraint for the base station. We solve this problem in an asymptotically optimal manner using dual decomposition. Our analysis shows that an SU becomes a candidate competing for a subcarrier only if its channel gain on this subcarrier is the largest among all and exceeds the second largest by a certain threshold. Furthermore, while the power allocation for NUs follows the conventional water-filling principle, the power allocation for SUs depends on both its own channel gain and the largest channel gain among others. We also develop a suboptimal algorithm to reduce the computational cost. Numerical studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of the achievable pair of information rate for NU and secrecy rate for SU at different power consumptions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5983315/05872025.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2159206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2159206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power and Subcarrier Allocation for Physical-Layer Security in OFDMA-Based Broadband Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Security","Broadband communication","Fading","Joints","Optimization","Information rates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","frequency division multiple access","radio networks","resource allocation","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","subcarrier allocation","physical-layer security","OFDMA-based broadband wireless networks","mobile users","resource allocation","downlink orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","secure users","secure data transmission","dual decomposition","water-filling principle","channel gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual decomposition","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)","physical-layer security","secrecy rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Power and Subcarrier Allocation for Physical-Layer Security in OFDMA-Based Broadband Wireless Networks","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5872025/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205667","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and Subcarrier Allocation for Physical-Layer Security in OFDMA-Based Broadband Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-tao-2159206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068243S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5983315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5983315","articleId":"5872025","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5872026,"authors":[{"name":"Xinpeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6069499/5872026/5872026-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinpeng Zhang (M'11) received the B.S. degree in computational mathematics from Jilin University, China, in 1995, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information systems from Shanghai University, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","Since 2004, he has been with the faculty of the School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, where he is currently a Professor.

If the amount of extracted data is large, we can reconstruct the original coefficients in the tampered area according to the constraints given by the extracted data.

To verify the design approach, the paper demonstrates a step-up/down reconfigurable SC power converter with five optional gain ratios. A dual-loop control scheme is employed to reconfigure the converter according to the instantaneous line/load conditions. A low-power, digital controller is designed in the subthreshold region for the feedback control loop. The converter was fabricated with a 130-nm CMOS process. Experimental results show that its output can be continuously regulated from 0.4 to 2.2 V, while allowing the input voltage to randomly vary between 0.9 and 1.5 V. The line regulation is maintained below 1.4%, with a lowest value of 0.07%.

Scalable video coding (SVC), combined with adaptive modulation and coding schemes (MCS) and wireless multicast, provides an excellent solution for streaming video to heterogeneous wireless devices. By choosing different MCSs for different video layers, SVC can provide good video quality to users in good channel conditions while maintaining basic video quality for users in bad channel conditions. A key issue to apply SVC to wireless multicast streaming is to choose appropriate MCS for each video layer and to determine the optimal resource allocation among multiple video sessions. We formulate this problem as total utility maximization, subject to the constraint of available radio resources. We prove that the formulated problem is NP-hard and propose an optimal, two-step dynamic programming solution with pseudo-polynomial time complexity. Simulation results show that our algorithm offers significant improvement on the video quality over a naive algorithm and an adapted greedy algorithm, especially in the scenarios with multiple real video sequences and limited radio resources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Video Multicast With Adaptive Modulation and Coding in Broadband Wireless Data Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2011.2157700","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/6151256/05872033.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2011.2157700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Video Multicast With Adaptive Modulation and Coding in Broadband Wireless Data Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5872033/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12537095","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Video Multicast With Adaptive Modulation and Coding in Broadband Wireless Data Systems","sourcePdf":"tnet-zhang-2157700-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067101S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6151256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6151256","articleId":"5872033","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5872037,"authors":[{"name":"Alain Hore","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement dInformatique, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6045652/5872037/5872037-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alain Hor\u00e9 received the B.E. degree in computer engineering from the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure Polytechnique, Universit\u00e9 de Yaound\u00e9 1, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, in 2002 and the M.A.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi, Chicoutimi, QC, Canada, in 2005.

Some hardware implementations of microarray image processing have been proposed in the literature and proved to be promising alternatives to the currently available software systems. However, the main drawback of those proposed approaches is the unsuitable addressing of the quantification of the gene spot in a realistic way without any assumption about the image surface. Our aim in this paper is to present a new image-reconstruction algorithm using the cellular neural network that solves the Navier-Stokes equation. This algorithm offers a robust method for estimating the background signal within the gene-spot region. The MATCNN toolbox for Matlab is used to test the proposed method. Quantitative comparisons are carried out, i.e., in terms of objective criteria, between our approach and some other available methods. It is shown that the proposed algorithm gives highly accurate and realistic measurements in a fully automated manner within a remarkably efficient time.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2159231","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6045652/05872042.pdf","startPage":"3296","endPage":"3301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2159231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular Neural Networks, the Navier\u2013Stokes Equation, and Microarray Image Reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cellular Neural Networks, the Navier\u2013Stokes Equation, and Microarray Image Reconstruction","volume":"20","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12300805","pubMedId":"21659025","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872042/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular Neural Networks, the Navier\u2013Stokes Equation, and Microarray Image Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tip-wang-2159231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070337S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6045652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6045652","articleId":"5872042","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5872051,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro Rodr\u00edguez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Terrassa-Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6099646/5872051/5872051-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (S\u201999\u2013M\u201904\u2013SM\u201910) received the B.S. degree from the University of Granada, Granada, Spain, in 1989, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in 1994 and 2004, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","In 1990, he joined as an Assistant Professor in the faculty of UPC where he became an Associate Professor in 1993.

Sample sizes for the two classes need not be the same; they are only assumed to reach a fixed, but arbitrary, asymptotic ratio with the dimensionality. From the asymptotic moment representations, we directly obtain double asymptotic expressions for the bias, variance, and RMS of the error estimators. The asymptotic expressions presented here generally provide good small sample approximations, as demonstrated via numerical experiments. The applicability of the theoretical results is illustrated by finding the minimum sample size to bound the RMS in gene-expression classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872073/","accessionNumber":"12205558","displayDocTitle":"Analytic Study of Performance of Error Estimators for Linear Discriminant Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic Study of Performance of Error Estimators for Linear Discriminant Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsp-dougherty-2159210-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119817S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5872073","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5872076,"authors":[{"name":"Lihi Zelnik-Manor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5872076/5872076-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lihi Zelnik-Manor (M'08) received the B.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, in 1995, where she graduated summa cum laude, and the M.Sc. degree (with honors) and the Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1998 and 2004, respectively.","After graduating, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Engineering and Applied Science, California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena.

In particular, a well-designed sensing matrix can reduce the coherence between the atoms of the equivalent dictionary, and as a consequence, reduce the reconstruction error. In some applications, the signals of interest can be well approximated by a union of a small number of subspaces (e.g., face recognition and motion segmentation). This implies the existence of a dictionary which leads to block-sparse representations. In this work, we propose a framework for sensing matrix design that improves the ability of block-sparse approximation techniques to reconstruct and classify signals. This method is based on minimizing a weighted sum of the interblock coherence and the subblock coherence of the equivalent dictionary. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves signal recovery and classification ability of the Block-OMP algorithm compared to sensing matrix optimization methods that do not employ block structure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing Matrix Optimization for Block-Sparse Decoding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2159211","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5978836/05872076.pdf","startPage":"4300","endPage":"4312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2159211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872076","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.35ffbf7d-99f4-4b58-817b-ab8de4a5586d","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2016/10/13/block-sparse-decoding","name":"Block Sparse Decoding\u00a0","language":"MATLAB","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=35ffbf7d-99f4-4b58-817b-ab8de4a5586d","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Sensing Matrix Optimization for Block-Sparse Decoding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5872076/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205561","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing Matrix Optimization for Block-Sparse Decoding","sourcePdf":"tsp-rosenblum-2159211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103031S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5872076","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5872077,"authors":[{"name":"Yiyin Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5872077/5872077-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiyin Wang (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2002, and the M.S. degree (cum laude) in microelectonics from the Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, and Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2005, respectively.","From 2005 to 2006, she was a Research Assistant with ASIC and System State Key Lab, Fudan University.

However, time-based localization is tightly coupled with clock synchronization. Thus, the reliability of timestamps in time-based localization becomes an important yet challenging task to deal with. In this paper, we propose robust time-based localization strategies to locate a target node with the help of anchors (nodes with known positions) in asynchronous networks. Two kinds of asynchronous networks are considered: one only with clock offsets, labeled quasi-synchronous networks, whereas the other with not only clock offsets but also clock skews, labeled fully asynchronous networks. A novel ranging protocol is developed for both networks, namely asymmetric trip ranging (ATR), to reduce the communication load and explore the broadcast property of WSNs. Regardless of the reliability of the timestamp report from the target node, closed-form least-squares (LS) estimators are derived to accurately estimate the target node position. As a result, we counter the uncertainties caused by the target node by ignoring the timestamps from this node. Furthermore, in order to simplify the estimator in fully asynchronous networks, localization and synchronization are decoupled. A simple yet efficient method is proposed to first Calibrate the Clock Skews of the anchors, and then Estimate the Node Position (CCS-ENP). Finally, Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds (CRBs) and simulation results corroborate the efficiency of our localization schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872077/","accessionNumber":"12205562","displayDocTitle":"Robust Time-Based Localization for Asynchronous Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Time-Based Localization for Asynchronous Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2159215-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129959S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5872077","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5872078,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang-Meng Liu","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5872078/5872078-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhang-Meng Liu (S'09) received the Bachelor's degree in electronic science and engineering from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China, in 2006.","Currently, he is working towards the Ph.D. degree in the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China.

In W-CMSR, the lower left triangular elements of the covariance matrix are aligned to form a new measurement vector, and DOA estimation is then realized by representing this vector on an over-complete dictionary under the constraint of sparsity. The a priori information of the incident signal number is not needed in W-CMSR, and no spectral decomposition or focusing is introduced. Simulation results demonstrate the satisfying performance of W-CMSR in wideband DOA estimation in various settings. Moreover, theoretical analysis and numerical examples show how many simultaneous signals can be separated by W-CMSR on typical array geometries, and that the half-wavelength spacing restriction in avoiding ambiguity can be relaxed from the highest to the lowest frequency of the incident wideband signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal

communication system design. The fixed-complexity sphere decoder (FSD) algorithm is one of the most promising approaches, enabling quasi-ML decoding accuracy and high performance implementation due to its deterministic, highly parallel structure. However, it suffers from exponential growth in computational complexity as the number of MIMO transmit antennas increases, critically limiting its scalability to larger MIMO system topologies. In this correspondence, we present a solution to this problem by applying a novel cutting protocol to the decoding tree of a real-valued FSD algorithm. The new real-valued fixed-complexity sphere decoder (RFSD) algorithm derived achieves similar quasi-ML decoding performance as FSD, but with an average 70% reduction in computational complexity, as we demonstrate from both theoretical and implementation perspectives for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)-MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Valued Fixed-Complexity Sphere Decoder for High Dimensional QAM-MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2159213","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5978836/05872079.pdf","startPage":"4493","endPage":"4499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2159213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Real-Valued Fixed-Complexity Sphere Decoder for High Dimensional QAM-MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5872079/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205564","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Valued Fixed-Complexity Sphere Decoder for High Dimensional QAM-MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-zheng-2159213-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059369S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5872079","onlineDate":"09 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5872082,"authors":[{"name":"Caijun Zhong","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Caijun","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37391285800"},{"name":"Tharm Ratnarajah","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen's University Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Tharm","lastName":"Ratnarajah","id":"37065840000"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5872082","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":155,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1796},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Fading","Temperature distribution","Relays","Random variables","Materials requirements planning","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decode and forward communication","Nakagami channels","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami-m fading channels","outage analysis","decode-and-forward systems","cognitive dual-hop systems","interference constraint","interference temperature limit","outage probability expression","fading severity","channel quality","secondary transmission links"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio systems","decode-and-forward (DF) relaying","interference temperature","Nakagami-$m$ fading","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the outage probability performance of decode-and-forward (DF) cognitive dual-hop systems for Nakagami-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\n fading channels, with consideration of an interference temperature limit.

EXIT analysis is adapted to multi-edge by introducing multi-dimensional EXIT iterated-function system analysis. Under this conceptualization, a successful decoding condition is developed by estimating fixed points of the dynamical system using its numerical gradient. Optimized ensembles are found for 16-QAM with thresholds matching the best known ensembles of equal complexity. For 64 to 1024-QAM, sufficiently high bit-channel capacities allow for extension of lower-order optimized ensembles, leading a practical nested code structure.

Moreover, the cognitive user uses Gel'fand-Pinsker binning in order to reduce the interference at its own receiver. We also provide an outer bound on the capacity region of this channel and show that characterizing the capacity region of a three-user C-ZIFC is non-trivial based on the two-user case; the reason lies in the fact that the three-user setup captures the specifications of the IFC like independent channel inputs.

In this paper, we present a simple but novel technique to develop theoretical PAPR bounds of downlink MC-CDMA system using Golay complementary sequences for spreading and coding. The developed PAPR bounds are independent of the spreading factor in uncoded MC-CDMA. Furthermore, they have no dependency on the number of spreading processes as well as the spreading factor in coded MC-CDMA. Simulation results demonstrate that the theoretical bounds are well followed by 99.9% PAPRs which are also independent of spreading factors (for uncoded and coded cases), and the number of spreading processes (for coded case only).

In other words, the spectral distribution of random matrices from these sequences dramatically differs from that of the random i.i.d. generated matrices. In contrast, Gold sequences manifest the group randomness properties of random i.i.d. sequences.

In this paper we investigate adaptive single-trial error/erasure decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, i.e. we derive an adaptive erasing strategy which minimizes the residual codeword error probability after decoding. Our result is applicable to any error/erasure decoding algorithm as long as its decoding capabilities can be expressed by a decoder capability function. Examples are Bounded Minimum Distance decoding with the Berlekamp-Massey- or the Sugiyama algorithms and the Guruswami-Sudan list decoder.","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2011.5872121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2011.5872121","startPage":"47","endPage":"51","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5765598/5872101/05872121.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 12th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive single-trial error/erasure decoding of Reed-Solomon codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive single-trial error/erasure decoding of Reed-Solomon codes","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872121/","accessionNumber":"12047810","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872121/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive single-trial error/erasure decoding of Reed-Solomon codes","confLoc":"Kelowna, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"1211495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058997S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5765598","isNumber":"5872101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5765598","xplore-issue":"5872101","articleId":"5872121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5872128,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Feng","id":"37307368300"},{"name":"Danilo Silva","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Silva","id":"37320762500"},{"name":"Frank R.

It is shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for a band-limited periodic signal to be positive for all time is that the frequency coefficients form an autocorrelation sequence. Instead of sending data directly on the subcarriers, the autocorrelation of the complex data sequence is performed before transmission to guarantee non-negativity. In z-domain, the average optical power is linked to the position of the zeros and used for the design of signal sets. In contrast to previous approaches, SFO-OFDM is able to use the entire bandwidth for data transmission and does not require reserved subcarriers. Using a sub-optimal design technique with 9 subcarriers and 8 bits per symbol, SFO-OFDM has a 0.5 dB gain over ACO-OFDM at a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n and a reduction in peak-to-average ratio of more than 30%.","doi":"10.1109/CWIT.2011.5872134","publicationTitle":"2011 12th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 12th Canadian Workshop on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/5765598/5872101/05872134.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CWIT.2011.5872134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872101","startPage":"102","endPage":"105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrally factorized optical OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrally factorized optical OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872134/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12047823","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872134/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrally factorized optical OFDM","confLoc":"Kelowna, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"2513031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07994S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5765598","isNumber":"5872101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5765598","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5872101","articleId":"5872134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872139,"authors":[{"name":"Shuangshuang Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Shuangshuang","lastName":"Han","id":"37714643300"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37281000600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0742-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0743-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0741-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5872139","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Complexity theory","MIMO","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Hardware","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","decoding","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity-efficient detection","MIMO relay networks","equivalent maximum likelihood detector","ML detector","multibranch dual-hop multiple-input multiple-output relay networks","complexity-efficient sphere decoder","CSD","fixed complexity sphere decoder","direct link","cooperative partial detection","performance loss","detect-and-forward relaying","amplify-and-forward relaying","optimal ML performance","MIMO relay detection","hardware implementation"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides the equivalent maximum likelihood (ML) detector at the destination of multi-branch dual-hop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks.

Of specific interest is the case of a array of extremely closely spaced antennas with complexity constraints, here implemented being restricted to a single RF chain. Our system model is developed in context of closely spaced metamaterial antennas that have low mutual coupling. Even without mutual coupling, the physical location of the antennas still contributes to strong spatial correlation. We also re-derive the mutual information equation for both RF and digital beamforming techniques under the assumption that the transmitter has no information regards to the channel. Further, by comparing the capacity improvement between different receiver combining techniques, this paper suggests that in a closely spaced antenna system with only one RF-chain and transmitter, selection across beams provides higher capacity than using the traditional approach of element-selection. Furthermore, beamforming based MIMO processing is more robust to different scattering environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12047839","htmlLink":"/document/5872150/","conferenceDate":"17-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"RF beamforming with closely spaced antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF beamforming with closely spaced antennas","confLoc":"Kelowna, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"4115869.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044345S","chronDate":"17-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5765598","isNumber":"5872101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5765598","xplore-issue":"5872101","articleId":"5872150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5872152,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Bayesteh","affiliation":["Research in Motion Limited, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Bayesteh","id":"37327977200"},{"name":"Amin Mobasher","affiliation":["Research in Motion Limited, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Mobasher","id":"37418536800"},{"name":"Yongkang Jia","affiliation":["Research in Motion Limited, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yongkang","lastName":"Jia","id":"38021009900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0742-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0743-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0741-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5872152","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Interference","Time frequency analysis","Throughput","Frequency division multiaccess","Minimization","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radio links","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink multiuser interference alignment","two-cell scenario","downlink multiuser MIMO transmission","interfering transmitter","M antenna","K antenna","transmission scheme","reception scheme","channel state information","Euclidean distance minimization","time extension","frequency extension"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the problem of Downlink Multi-User MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) transmission from two interfering transmitters, each equipped with M antennas to multiple users each equipped with K antennas is considered.

The loss of a packet after traveling some hops results in waste of all the resources allocated to it in previous hops. The existing resource allocation schemes may not provide optimal resource utilization in such network as this issue has been greatly ignored. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scheme to allocate transmit power to different packets favoring those which have traveled more hops before reaching a particular node. We present a cross-layer approach in which link layer gets the hop-count information from network layer module. Distributed implementation is possible with the proposed scheme because each node can access this information. We formulate the power allocation problem as a convex optimization problem and obtain its analytical solution by using Lagrangian duality. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is capable of minimizing wastage of network resources used by packets in their previous hops without any degradation in throughput and outage performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 May

diverse NVM application [1]. Still switching mechanism and classification are not clear, there are simply two kinds of switching polarity: unipolar and bipolar. Considering distribution, operation margin and so on, bipolar switching looks much attractive than unipolar. Along with a selective device, polarity of switching could make the architecture of cell array different. The Crossbar array structure has been considered an attractive solution for unipolar switching with diode. To make the crossbar array with bipolar switching devices, research on a new selective device such as MIEC [2] is much necessary to meet the requirements of current drivability and on/off properties. In addition, self-rectifying device [3-4] could be an alternative for a high density crossbar array. Recently, several research groups have shown very fast and high reliable device. It could be a good signal that ReRAM could have speed and endurance for DRAM or embedded applications. In case of those applications, 1T1R structure could be an effective and it could be used to check the feasibility by changing ReRAM cell with capacitor or MTJ. From now on, transistor has been mainly considered as a controller for the compliance current in set process. But the bipolar 1T1R structure for a high density array, there are several things to be considered, because a transistor would be acting as a changeable resistance at a set and reset process and its resistance goes up as the technology shrinks. So in this paper, we tried to figure out the requirements of bipolar ReRAM switching for the high density 1T1R memory array by changing reset current and symmetry of ReRAM devices.","doi":"10.1109/VTSA.2011.5872232","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Applications","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779880/5872202/05872232.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTSA.2011.5872232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Requirements of bipolar switching ReRAM for 1T1R type high density memory array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tin","Switches","Transistors","Arrays","Resistance","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar switching ReRAM","1T1R type high density memory array","diverse NVM application","switching mechanism","switching polarity","crossbar array structure","unipolar switching","bipolar switching devices","high density crossbar array","ReRAM cell"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Requirements of bipolar switching ReRAM for 1T1R type high density memory array","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12047883","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872232/","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872232/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Requirements of bipolar switching ReRAM for 1T1R type high density memory array","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"T44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071384S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5779880","isNumber":"5872202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779880","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5872202","articleId":"5872232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5872249,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Fully depleted (FD) devices with undoped channels eliminate the threshold voltage VT variability due to random dopant fluctuation (RDF) reducing the overall VT variability by over 60%. For a given power supply FD devices have superior short channel behavior, exhibit significant lower leakage Ioff compared to bulk devices. These FD advantages enable an efficient power-perfomance-area (ppa) optimization at lowest VDD (e.g. ~0.6V) which is not possible with a bulk device architecture without a significant performance and area penalty. FD devices can be planar or FinFETs. In both cases SOI substrates enable an industrial architecture of ultra thin body (UTB) devices. Planar UTB devices offer the benefits of FD behavior in conjunction with an evolutionary IC design approach but require a highly uniform SOI UTB layer. UTSOI is an industrially mature SOI substrate technology that offers a highly uniform SOI thickness layer with \u00b10.5nm (7 sigma) thickness uniformity. Smart Cut technology is here offering its unique advantages in integrating a thin BOX layer thru wafer bonding, while accessing atom level uniformities thru hydrogen implantation. Furthermore, SOI thickness and buried oxide (BOX) thickness are decoupled parameters and can be tuned to meet the requirements of any IC sub-32nm CMOS technology. UTSOI substrates can be produced in large volumes in existing multiple sources, then, FDSOI devices are able to offer the option of merging G and LP technology in a cost effective platform for a wide range of applications.","doi":"10.1109/VTSA.2011.5872261","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779880/5872202/05872261.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTSA.2011.5872261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending planar device roadmap beyond node 20nm through ultra thin body technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872261/","displayDocTitle":"Extending planar device roadmap beyond node 20nm through ultra thin body technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12047907","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872261/","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending planar device roadmap beyond node 20nm through ultra thin body technology","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"T81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042471S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5779880","isNumber":"5872202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779880","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5872202","articleId":"5872261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5872277,"authors":[{"name":"Jerzy Siuzdak","affiliation":["Instytut Telekomunikacji, Politechnika Warszawska, Warszawa, Poland"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Siuzdak","id":"37304004500"},{"name":"Marcin Kowalczyk","affiliation":["Instytut Telekomunikacji, Politechnika Warszawska, Warszawa, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5783449/5872275/5872277/5872277-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marcin Kowalczyk was born in 1981 in Busko-Zdroj, Poland.

The quality of the received signals varied among channels and in time but in general it was better than in the case when central launches were employed in all channels.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872277","publicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783449/5872275/05872277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872275","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"4-Channel incoherent MIMO transmission over MM fiber with different offset light launch","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"4-Channel incoherent MIMO transmission over MM fiber with different offset light launch","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872277/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12048195","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872277/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"4-Channel incoherent MIMO transmission over MM fiber with different offset light launch","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569394237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043764S","chronDate":"15-16 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783449","isNumber":"5872275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783449","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5872275","articleId":"5872277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872278,"authors":[{"name":"Xingzhong Xiong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and technology on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China","Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Zigong, China"],"firstName":"Xingzhong","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37595113300"},{"name":"Jianhao Hu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and technology on Communication, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Jianhao","lastName":"Hu","id":"37366051200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0453-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0452-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5872278","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"abstract":"According to the high complexity of pre-coder in single-carrier interleave-division multiple access (IDMA) systems, in this paper, we propose a precoding technique based on time-reversal (TR) for single-carrier IDMA systems. The proposed scheme gets the channel impulse responses (CIR) through time-division duplexing (TDD) mode, and uses the time-reversed version of the CIR to pre-coder the transmitted signal at transmitter. The receiver adopts the iterative Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) frequency domain equalization (FDE) algorithm. Thus the pre-coder of transmitter is simple and easy to implement as compared with water filling pre-coder and optimal pre-coder, and the receiver can be simplified by canceling complex computation. The simulation results show that the performance of TR pre-coder is close to that of optimized pre-coder and that of water filling in single-carrier IDMA systems based on iterative LMMSE-FDE algorithm when signal to noise ratio (SNR) is higher than 3.5dB. The simulation results also demonstrate that TR pre-coder has potential advantages.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783449/5872275/05872278.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A precoding technique based on time reversal for single-carrier IDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","precoding","time division multiple access","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precoding technique","single-carrier IDMA systems","single-carrier interleave-division multiple access systems","time-reversal","channel impulse responses","time-division duplexing mode","TDD mode","transmitter","receiver","iterative linear minimum mean square error algorithm","frequency domain equalization algorithm","iterative LMMSE-FDE algorithm","signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IDMA","pre-coder","LMMSE","FDE","TR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A precoding technique based on time reversal for single-carrier IDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872278/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12048196","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","conferenceDate":"15-16 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A precoding technique based on time reversal for single-carrier IDMA systems","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569394913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054531S","chronDate":"15-16 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783449","isNumber":"5872275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783449","xplore-issue":"5872275","articleId":"5872278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5872279,"authors":[{"name":"Johnny Karout","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden","Communication Systems Group, Department of Signals and Systems"],"firstName":"Johnny","lastName":"Karout","id":"37680247600"},{"name":"Henk Wymeersch","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden","Communication Systems Group, Department of Signals and Systems"],"firstName":"Henk","lastName":"Wymeersch","id":"37269700200"},{"name":"A.

When modulators are studied in combination with adaptive receiver algorithms that rely on independent data, misconvergence may result. In this contribution, we investigate the impact of such correlation on a standard blind equalization method and provide guidelines to avoid misconvergence. Our results indicate that care needs to be taken when using a single PRBS sequence and that decorrelation delays must be chosen appropriately.

At first considering a generic system in a slowly changing multipath channel where high dispersion in the individual users performance exists, we apply different types of interleaving and show that they in general help in achieving fairness. In particular, by introducing the application of cyclically shifted random interleaver, we demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving BER fairness over others (dispersion in individual users BER reduced by 89% compared to no interleaving at 15dB SNR). Then we explore the comparative performance of different interleavers at varying active user density considering a system based on the IEEE 802.16 standard specifications. Finally, for a generic OFDMA, we investigate the PAPR distribution of different interleavers as the system moves from low to high user loads. Based on the results, we conclude that for a heavily loaded system, cyclically shifted random interleavers can effectively ensure uniform performance amongst active users with reduced system complexity and manageable PAPR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of BER fairness and PAPR for interleaved OFDMA system","publicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872280","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783449/5872275/05872280.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872280/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Study of BER fairness and PAPR for interleaved OFDMA system","conferenceDate":"15-16 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872280/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12048198","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of BER fairness and PAPR for interleaved OFDMA system","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569397087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061461S","chronDate":"15-16 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783449","isNumber":"5872275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783449","xplore-issue":"5872275","articleId":"5872280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5872285,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqin Ning","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, USA","Department of Information Technology, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guoqin","lastName":"Ning","id":"37285616100"},{"name":"Jiaqi Duan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Jiaqi","lastName":"Duan","id":"38018570000"},{"name":"Jian Su","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Su","id":"38026517300"},{"name":"Duo Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Duo","lastName":"Qiu","id":"38019012700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0453-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0452-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5872285","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":401},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872285","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Spread spectrum communication","Channel allocation","Mobile communication","Delay","Numerical models","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","cognitive radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","probability","telecommunication network routing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum heterogeneity","multihop handoff","centralized cognitive radio network","node mobility","link available time","spectrum sharing algorithm","spectrum transmission range","channel predicted usage time","channel allocation","multihop routing","channel handoff","channel utilization","blocking probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sharing","spectrum heterogeneity","multi-hop routing","spectrum handoff"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872285","publicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783449/5872275/05872285.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sharing based on spectrum heterogeneity and multi-hop handoff in centralized cognitive radio networks","abstract":"Most previous work on spectrum sharing in the cognitive radio (CR) networks did not take into account the influence of node mobility on link available time as well as the spectrum heterogeneity. In this paper, a spectrum sharing algorithm based on spectrum heterogeneity is presented for centralized CR network, meanwhile the individual CR users are free to be mobile. A prediction model of channel usage time is proposed, which is based on the mobility of CR users and spectrum transmission range. The channel predicted usage time is main metrics for the spectrum sharing. In order to decrease channel handoffs resulting from short channel usage time, a usage threshold time is set for the channel allocation. When channel handoff cannot be implemented in a single hop, the multi-hop routing will be established to keep the communication. Simulation results reveal that the amount of channel handoffs can be considerably reduced after using the predicted channel usage time, the channel utilization is enhanced and the handoff blocking probability is also dramatically decreased simultaneously. In addition, the further simulation results show that apart from the PU activity, CR node's mobility is also vital to the channel handoffs and link available time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872285/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12048203","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"15-16 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872285/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing based on spectrum heterogeneity and multi-hop handoff in centralized cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing based on spectrum heterogeneity and multi-hop handoff in centralized cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569397855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091707S","chronDate":"15-16 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783449","isNumber":"5872275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783449","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5872275","articleId":"5872285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872287,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Li","affiliation":["Wireless Network Research and Development group, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Zheng Li","id":"37857030800"},{"name":"Rong Zhang","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent Shanghai Bell Company Limited, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Rong Zhang","id":"38021766600"},{"name":"Guoyong Chen","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent Shanghai Bell Company Limited, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Guoyong Chen","id":"38023952000"},{"name":"Doug Clark","affiliation":["Wireless Network Research and Development group, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Doug","lastName":"Clark","id":"37853464200"},{"name":"Hai Chen","affiliation":["Wireless Network Research and Development group, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Hai Chen","id":"37859635400"},{"name":"Yu Wan","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent Shanghai Bell Company Limited, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yu Wan","id":"38025484700"},{"name":"Jiaguan Leng","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent Shanghai Bell Company Limited, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jiaguan Leng","id":"38021207000"},{"name":"Marc Shelton","affiliation":["Wireless Network Research and Development group, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Shelton","id":"37859379600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0453-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0452-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5872287","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Transmitters","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","code division multiple access","phase shift keying","pulse amplitude modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-order modulation scheme","QPSK accelerators","HSPA evolution","UMTS","channel unit processor","3GPP","base station","BTS baseband processor","WCDMA","baseband transmission","BPSK","PAM","QAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASIC","HOM","HSPA","QPSK"]}],"abstract":"The UMTS Channel Unit Processor for 3GPP Base Station introduced earlier in its early version is an advanced 3G BTS baseband processor system that includes the QPSK Tx and couple of other key ASIC accelerators.

At the end the paper gives out a general form of the combinational implementation for the higher order QAM (HOM) schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-order modulation scheme based on combinational QPSK accelerators for HSPA evolution in UE","publicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872287","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783449/5872275/05872287.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"High-order modulation scheme based on combinational QPSK accelerators for HSPA evolution in UE","conferenceDate":"15-16 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872287/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12048205","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-order modulation scheme based on combinational QPSK accelerators for HSPA evolution in UE","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569400239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044114S","chronDate":"15-16 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783449","isNumber":"5872275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783449","xplore-issue":"5872275","articleId":"5872287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5872290,"authors":[{"name":"Fangjiang Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fangjiang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37713253900"},{"name":"Shaowei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shaowei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538887500"},{"name":"Sidan Du","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Sidan","lastName":"Du","id":"37278913000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0453-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0452-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5872290","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","OFDM","Resource management","Cognitive radio","Optimization","Iterative methods","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","intercarrier interference","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","multicell cognitive radio systems","secondary user","radio spectrum","primary user","interference power","intercarrier interference","OFDM subchannels","interference constraints","iterative algorithm","equilibrium point"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we study the resource allocation problem for an OFDM-based multi-cell cognitive radio (CR) system, in which the secondary user (SU) of the CR system shares radio spectrum conditionally with the primary user (PU) of a licensed system. The SUs can use the whole licensed bandwidth of PUs, as long as the interference power introduced to the PUs is within the tolerable margin. Since the SUs of different CR cells can transmit signals using the same subchannels, the inter-carrier interference among the SUs should also be considered. We propose an efficient algorithm to allocate bits of OFDM subchannels in a single CR cell by jointly considering the transmitting power and interference constraints. An iterative algorithm is adopted to update the interference level of each cell until an equilibrium point is reached, which means the interference introduced to all PUs is below the predefined threshold while obtaining the maximum capacity. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm performs better than other methods.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872290","publicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783449/5872275/05872290.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872275","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation in OFDM-based multi-cell cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation in OFDM-based multi-cell cognitive radio systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872290/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12048208","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872290/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation in OFDM-based multi-cell cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569403183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051929S","chronDate":"15-16 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783449","isNumber":"5872275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783449","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5872275","articleId":"5872290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872291,"authors":[{"name":"Hualai Gu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hualai","lastName":"Gu","id":"38020774400"},{"name":"Shaowei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shaowei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538887500"},{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","id":"38008292500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0453-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0452-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5872291","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"abstract":"Resource allocation is an important issue in multiuser cognitive OFDM systems. In this paper, the highest achievable rate of each OFDM subchannel for a cognitive radio user (also referred to as secondary user, SU) is calculated by jointly considering the channel gain and the interference level. A low complexity algorithm is presented to allocate radio resource to the SUs. Each subchannel is assigned to the SU with the highest achievable rate. Then a simple but efficient algorithm is developed to allocate bits to each subchannel, which is also based on the highest achievable rates of subchannels. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm can produce solutions close to the optimal. Furthermore, the algorithm has lower complexity compared to other existing methods, rendering it promising for practical wireless systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783449/5872275/05872291.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2011 20th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC)","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2011.5872291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximize sum capacity of multiuser cognitive OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Interference","Complexity theory","Wireless communication","Bit rate","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cognitive radio","communication complexity","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser cognitive OFDM system","maximize sum capacity","OFDM subchannel","cognitive radio user","channel gain","radiofrequency interference level","low complexity algorithm","radio resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Maximize sum capacity of multiuser cognitive OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872291/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12048209","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","conferenceDate":"15-16 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximize sum capacity of multiuser cognitive OFDM systems","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569403189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053992S","chronDate":"15-16 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783449","isNumber":"5872275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783449","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5872275","articleId":"5872291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872298,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Bkassiny","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Bkassiny","id":"37541910400"},{"name":"Sudharman K.

We assume that the primary users' channel occupancy follows a Markovian evolution, and formulate the spectrum sensing problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DEC-POMDP). We develop a distributed Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that allows each autonomous cognitive radio to distributively learn its own spectrum sensing policy. The resulting decentralized sensing policy enables secondary users to non-cooperatively reach an equilibrium that leads to high utilization of idle channels while minimizing the collisions among secondary cognitive radios. Moreover, we propose a decentralized channel access policy that permits controlling, with high accuracy, the collision probability with primary users. Our numerical results validate the robustness of this collision probability control as the sensing noise changes. They also show the efficiency of the proposed learning algorithm in improving the spectrum utilization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872298/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12048216","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"15-16 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872298/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Reinforcement Learning based MAC protocols for autonomous cognitive secondary users","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Reinforcement Learning based MAC protocols for autonomous cognitive secondary users","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"1569405887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058324S","chronDate":"15-16 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783449","isNumber":"5872275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783449","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5872275","articleId":"5872298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5872301,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Laufer","affiliation":["The Center of Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research ECE, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Laufer","id":"37562264100"},{"name":"Yeheskel Bar-Ness","affiliation":["The Center of Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research ECE, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yeheskel","lastName":"Bar-Ness","id":"38272137900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0454-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0453-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0452-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5872301","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Ice","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Space time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bootstrapping","channel estimation","decoding","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bootstrap decoding","Alamouti space-time scheme","imperfect channel estimation","space time codes","mismatched filter","signal separator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alamouti","Space Time Codes","Imperfect Channel Estimation","Bootstrap Algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Imperfect channel estimation results in the introduction of symbols coupling for system with space time codes encoding when decoded by the mismatched filter.

However, in order for a reference/template to be a useful constraint, it has to be correctly aligned with the target image to be determined. This paper addresses this new image registration problem of registering a high-resolution image to a target image of which only limited measurements are available. We solve this problem using an intermediate image model, which expresses the target image as a combination of a generalized series (with basis constructed from a motion-dependent reference image) and a residual component. An algorithm is proposed to determine the motion parameters. Performance of the proposed method has been analyzed by computer simulations. Accurate motion compensation is demonstrated. The proposed method is expected to make image reconstruction using prior information from a reference more robust in the presence of object motion.","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872357","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872357.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion compensation for reference-constrained image reconstruction from limited data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Motion compensation for reference-constrained image reconstruction from limited data","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872357/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048267","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872357/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion compensation for reference-constrained image reconstruction from limited data","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075121S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872359,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Dong","id":"37596968800"},{"name":"Jim Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Ji","id":"37286273900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4127-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7928"}],"articleNumber":"5872359","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","TV","Minimization","Transforms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Noise","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","data acquisition","image coding","image reconstruction","Laplace transforms","medical image processing","noise","piecewise constant techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing MRI","Laplacian sparsifying transform","data acquisition","sparsity constraint","first-order difference","piecewise constant imaging","second-order difference","Laplacian filters","compresses MR image signals","image reconstruction","noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","B1 inhomogenity","coil sensitivity","total variation","second-order difference"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sensing (CS) is an emerging technique to speed up the data acquisition in MRI. CS relies on the sparsity constraint of the underlying image. Currently total variation (TV) is being used ubiquitously in CS-MRI as a sparsity measurement.

In this paper, a sparsifying transform based on the second-order difference (SD), i.e., Laplacian (LP) filters, is introduced as an alternative to the first-order difference. The new transform compresses MR image signals better than in the conventional TV framework. Therefore it is expected to enable improved CS reconstruction, particularly for images that are not piece-wise constant such as those acquired with nonuniform B\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n sensitivities.

A recent breakthrough concept called compressed sensing (CS) shows that sparse or, more generally, compressible signals can be recovered from a small number of linear random measurements. CS, using random measurements, has also been successfully applied to MRI for fast acquisition. In a recent work, we have preliminarily employed deterministic chaos in CS that potentially offers a more practical and efficient CS framework. This paper adapts chaotic CS to MRI acquisition. In particular, we use chaotic logistic map for CS and adapt it to acquire the 2-dimensional MRI. In addition, we numerically analyze the performance of the proposed chaotic CS for MRI and show that it performs better random CS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast image acquisition in magnetic resonance imaging by chaotic compressed sensing","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872360","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872360.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fast image acquisition in magnetic resonance imaging by chaotic compressed sensing","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872360/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048270","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast image acquisition in magnetic resonance imaging by chaotic compressed sensing","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042317S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872364,"authors":[{"name":"Snehashis Roy","affiliation":["Image Analysis and Communications Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, USA"],"firstName":"Snehashis","lastName":"Roy","id":"37981872300"},{"name":"Aaron Carass","affiliation":["Image Analysis and Communications Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, USA"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Carass","id":"37294199500"},{"name":"Jerry L.

During image acquisition, the inhomogeneity present in the radio-frequency (RF) coil appears as shading artifact in the intensity image. The inhomogeneity poses problem in any automatic algorithm that uses intensity as a feature. It has been shown that at low field strength, the shading can be assumed to be a smooth field that is composed of low frequency components. Thus most inhomogeneity correction algorithms assume some kind of explicit smoothness criteria on the field. This sometimes limits the performance of the algorithms if the actual inhomogeneity is not smooth, which is the case at higher field strength. We describe a model-free, nonparametric patch-based approach that uses compressed sensing for the correction. We show that these features enable our algorithm to perform comparably with a current state of the art method N3 on images acquired at low field, while outperforming N3 when the image has non-smooth inhomogeneity, such as 7T images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872364.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing based intensity non-uniformity correction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonhomogeneous media","Image segmentation","Compressed sensing","Magnetic resonance imaging","Radio frequency","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","image coding","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","intensity nonuniformity correction","gain field removal","magnetic resonance images","human brain","image acquisition","radio-frequency coil","shading artifact","image intensity","model-free nonparametric patch-based approach","N3","7T images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MRI","intensity non-uniformity","intensity inhomogeneity","7T","bias field","bias correction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing based intensity non-uniformity correction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872364/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048274","pubMedId":"24443667","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing based intensity non-uniformity correction","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062056S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5872365,"authors":[{"name":"Yoann Le Montagner","affiliation":["Institut Telecom,CNRS LTCI, TELECOM ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Yoann","lastName":"Le Montagner","id":"38286222300"},{"name":"Elsa Angelini","affiliation":["Institut Telecom,CNRS LTCI, TELECOM ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Elsa","lastName":"Angelini","id":"37289124100"},{"name":"Jean-Christophe Olivo-Marin","affiliation":["Institut Pasteur, Unit\u00e9 d''Analyse d''Image Quantitative, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Christophe","lastName":"Olivo-Marin","id":"38264510300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4127-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7928"}],"articleNumber":"5872365","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":441},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","TV","Minimization","Biomedical imaging","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","data analysis","data compression","fluorescence","image coding","image reconstruction","medical image processing","optical microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconstruction algorithms","compressed sensing","biological imaging","fluorescence microscopy","data fidelity","computational efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","sampling pattern","convex optimization","Fourier transform"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a short presentation of the compressed sensing imaging framework, along with a review of recent applications in the biomedical imaging field.

the most critical components of a computerized system for automated melanoma detection is image sampling and pooling of the extracted features. In this paper, we propose a new method for sampling and pooling based on a combination of spatial pooling and graph theory features. The performance of the new method is evaluated using a dataset of more than 1,500 images representing pigmented skin lesions of known pathology. In our comparisons, we include several methods ranging from simple and multi-scale sampling on a regular grid to more sophisticated approaches, such as blob and curvilinear structure detectors. Our results show that, despite its simplicity, simple sampling on a regular grid provides highly competitive performance, compared to the more sophisticated approaches, while multi-scale sampling yields only trivial improvements. However, the proposed method provides significant performance improvement in terms of sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% t-test), and the best performance in terms of specificity compared to all other methods explored.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872366/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048276","pubMedId":"24443668","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating sampling strategies of dermoscopic interest points","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating sampling strategies of dermoscopic interest points","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064837S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5872372,"authors":[{"name":"Tarun Wadhawan","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tarun","lastName":"Wadhawan","id":"37601854000"},{"name":"Ning Situ","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Situ","id":"37601854200"},{"name":"Keith Lancaster","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Lancaster","id":"38029462700"},{"name":"Xiaojing Yuan","affiliation":["Departments of Engineering Technology, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaojing","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37596681700"},{"name":"George Zouridakis","affiliation":["Departments of Engineering Technology, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Zouridakis","id":"37426618100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4127-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7928"}],"articleNumber":"5872372","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":674},"abstract":"We have developed a portable library for automated detection of melanoma termed SkinScan\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00a9</sup>\n that can be used on smartphones and other handheld devices.

The analysis of biological high content images often requires segmentation as a first step. We propose ilastik as an easy-to-use tool which allows the user without expertise in image processing to perform segmentation and classification in a unified way. ilastik learns from labels provided by the user through a convenient mouse interface. Based on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation. A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier. An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of representative images, it can be exported and used to automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using the CellProfiler pipeline). ilastik is an open source project and released under the BSD license at www.ilastik.org.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872394/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12048303","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872394/","publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ilastik: Interactive learning and segmentation toolkit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ilastik: Interactive learning and segmentation toolkit","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039145S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"525","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":5872425,"authors":[{"name":"Sylvain Merlet","affiliation":["Athena Project-Team, I.N.R.I.A.

In this paper, we describe a new and efficient method to accurately reconstruct the EAP in terms of the Spherical Polar Fourier (SPF) basis from very few diffusion weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRI). This approach nicely exploits the duality between SPF and a closely related basis in which one can respectively represent the EAP and the diffusion signal using the same coefficients, and efficiently combines it to the recent acquisition and reconstruction technique called Compressed Sensing (CS). Our work provides an efficient analytical solution to estimate, from few measurements, the diffusion propagator at any radius. We also provide a new analytical solution to extract an important feature characterising the tissue microstructure: the Orientation Distribution Function (ODF). We illustrate and prove the effectiveness of our method in reconstructing the propagator and the ODF on both noisy multiple q-shell synthetic and phantom data.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spherical Polar Fourier EAP and odf reconstruction via compressed sensing in diffusion mri","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872425","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872425.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spherical Polar Fourier EAP and odf reconstruction via compressed sensing in diffusion mri","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872425/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048333","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spherical Polar Fourier EAP and odf reconstruction via compressed sensing in diffusion mri","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077513S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5872427,"authors":[{"name":"Solveig Badillo","affiliation":["Neurospin, CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Solveig","lastName":"Badillo","id":"37847010700"},{"name":"Thomas Vincent","affiliation":["Neurospin, CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Vincent","id":"37410308900"},{"name":"Philippe Ciuciu","affiliation":["Neurospin, CEA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Ciuciu","id":"37284156700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4127-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7928"}],"articleNumber":"5872427","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872427","abstract":"Inter-subject analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data relies on single intra-subject studies, which are usually conducted using a massively univariate approach.

Our comparative study perfomed during a fast-event related paradigm involves 18 subjects and illustrates the regionspecific differences between the GLM, SAGLM and JDE analyses in terms of statistical sensitivity. On different contrasts of interest, spatial regularization is shown to have a beneficial impact on the statistical sensitivity.

non-invasively visualizing biological processes at the physiological and molecular levels in whole animals. Tomographic bioluminescence imaging (TBI) can further translate planar imaging into three-dimensional quantitative bioluminescent source distribution. Although many reconstruction methods have been developed, efforts are still needed to make the tomographic methods more practical for biomedical imaging experiments. In this paper, a fast reconstruction algorithm based on parallel coordinate descent optimization is proposed for in vivo tomographic bioluminescence imaging. Based on the shrinking operation, the proposed method is very efficient. Moreover, in order to obtain the analytic form of the updating shrinkage function, a smooth and convex approximation to the regularization term L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n is utilized, so this term can be easily generalized for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 2. In the experiments, the imaging performance of the proposed method demonstrates that it has the ability to recover reliable tomographic results with a wide range of regularization parameters and different p. Moreover, the high efficiency makes it potential for real time imaging reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872452","startPage":"492","endPage":"495","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872452.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast reconstruction algorithm based on parallel coordinate descent optimization for in vivo tomographic bioluminescence imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"A fast reconstruction algorithm based on parallel coordinate descent optimization for in vivo tomographic bioluminescence imaging","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872452/","accessionNumber":"12048360","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872452/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast reconstruction algorithm based on parallel coordinate descent optimization for in vivo tomographic bioluminescence imaging","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000492.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058343S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872492,"authors":[{"name":"Sonal Kothari","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Sonal","lastName":"Kothari","id":"37679316900"},{"name":"John H.

cancer confounder classes in prostate histology","abstract":"Gleason grading of prostate cancer is complicated by cancer confounders, or benign tissues closely resembling malignant processes (e.g. atrophy), which account for as much as 34% of misdiagnoses. Thus, it is critical to correctly identify confounders in a computer-aided diagnosis system. In this work, we present a cascaded multi-class pairwise classifier (CascaMPa) to identify the class of regions of interest (ROIs) of prostate tissue biopsies. CascaMPa incorporates domain knowledge to partition the multi-class problem into several binary-class tasks, reducing the intra-class heterogeneity that causes errors in one-versus-all multi-class approaches. Nuclear centroids are detected automatically via a deconvolution and watershed algorithm, and a set of features are calculated from graphs (Voronoi, Delaunay, and minimum spanning tree graphs) constructed on the centroids. The cascaded multi-class algorithm identifies each feature vector as one of six tissue classes: Gleason patterns 3, 4, and 5, normal epithelium and stroma, and non-cancerous atrophy (a cancer confounder) using a decision tree classifier. Performance of CascaMPa is evaluated using positive predictive value (PPV) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). For a database of 50 image patches per class (300 ROIs) from 118 patient studies, the classifier achieves an average PPV of 0.760 and AUC of 0.762 across all classes, while the one-versus-all approach yields an average PPV of 0.633 and AUC of 0.444.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872506/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048414","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cascaded multi-class pairwise classifier (CascaMPa) for normal, cancerous, and cancer confounder classes in prostate histology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascaded multi-class pairwise classifier (CascaMPa) for normal, cancerous, and cancer confounder classes in prostate histology","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0000715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061111S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5872507,"authors":[{"name":"David Mayerich","affiliation":["Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Mayerich","id":"37282589200"},{"name":"Jaerock Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kettering University, USA"],"firstName":"Jaerock","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37688616600"},{"name":"Aaron Panchal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Westmont College, USA"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Panchal","id":"38019527500"},{"name":"John Keyser","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Keyser","id":"37282588300"},{"name":"Yoonsuck Choe","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Yoonsuck","lastName":"Choe","id":"37270214200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4127-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7928"}],"articleNumber":"5872507","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Artificial neural networks","Computer architecture","Training","Feature extraction","Microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","biological tissues","biomedical optical imaging","cellular biophysics","coprocessors","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets","optical microscopy","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast cell detection","high throughput imagery","GPU accelerated machine learning","high throughput microscopy","large tissue samples","subcellular information","data set size","data set complexity","parallel processing algorithms","scalable algorithms","high throughput imaging techniques","cell soma detection","knife edge scanning microscopy","KESM","real time cell detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microscopy","three-dimensional","segmentation","seed points","cell soma"]}],"abstract":"High-throughput microscopy allows fast imaging of large tissue samples, producing an unprecedented amount of sub-cellular information.

We find that compared to healthy controls, the schizophrenic group presents an altered hierarchy with a number of unusual connections and a significantly decreased small-world index, suggesting disease-related changes in the organization of brain connectivity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical and graphical analysis of fMRI network connectivity in healthy and schizophrenic groups","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872577","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872577.pdf","startPage":"1031","endPage":"1034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical and graphical analysis of fMRI network connectivity in healthy and schizophrenic groups","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872577/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048485","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical and graphical analysis of fMRI network connectivity in healthy and schizophrenic groups","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069104S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872579,"authors":[{"name":"SS Vasanawala","affiliation":["Radiology, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"SS","lastName":"Vasanawala","id":"37071130200"},{"name":"MJ Murphy","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"MJ","lastName":"Murphy","id":"37087353212"},{"name":"MT Alley","affiliation":["Radiology, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"MT","lastName":"Alley","id":"37071645400"},{"name":"P Lai","affiliation":["GE Healthcare"],"firstName":"P","lastName":"Lai","id":"38020268100"},{"name":"K Keutzer","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Keutzer","id":"37267034900"},{"name":"JM Pauly","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"JM","lastName":"Pauly","id":"37087352855"},{"name":"M Lustig","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Lustig","id":"37828707700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4127-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7928"}],"articleNumber":"5872579","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1548},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Coils","Compressed sensing","Magnetic resonance imaging","Acceleration","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","coprocessors","image reconstruction","iterative methods","medical image processing","multiprocessing systems","paediatrics","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel imaging compressed sensing MRI","accelerating body MRI","paediatric patients","paediatric body imaging","3D spoiled gradient echo","Poisson disc random undersampling","\u21131-SPIRiT","iterative autocalibrating parallel imaging reconstruction algorithm","wavelet domain data consistency","wavelet domain joint sparsity","on line parallelized implementation","multicore CPU","general purpose graphics processors","GPGPU","3D image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","Parallel Imaging","SPIRiT","Pediatric MRI"]}],"abstract":"For the last two years, we have been experimenting with applying compressed sensing parallel imaging for body imaging of pediatric patients.

First, through mode analysis we are able to capture the dominant component of the respiratory image motion and increase the chance of finding the global optimum. Second, an information theoretic measure is proposed to assess the uncertainty of the motion estimation and automatically detect unreliable motion estimates. The benefits of the proposed method are shown through evaluations performed on real clinical data from different procedures of percutaneous coronary interventions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-assessing image-based respiratory motion compensation for fluoroscopic coronary roadmapping","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872585","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872585.pdf","startPage":"1065","endPage":"1069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Self-assessing image-based respiratory motion compensation for fluoroscopic coronary roadmapping","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872585/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048493","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-assessing image-based respiratory motion compensation for fluoroscopic coronary roadmapping","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056668S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5872600,"authors":[{"name":"B.

lensless, sub-pixel resolving optofluidic microscope (SROFM) based on the super resolution algorithm. The device utilizes microfluidic flow to deliver specimens directly across a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor to generate a sequence of low-resolution (LR) projection images, where resolution is limited by the sensor's pixel size. This image sequence is then processed with a pixel super-resolution algorithm to reconstruct a single high resolution (HR) image, where features beyond the Nyquist rate of the LR images are resolved. We demonstrate the device's capabilities by imaging red blood cell, microspheres, protist Euglena gracilis, and Entamoeba invadens cysts with sub-cellular resolution. We also demonstrate the capability of SROFM for malaria infected red blood cell diagnostics.","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872653","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872653.pdf","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subpixel resolving optofluidic microscope based on super resolution algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Subpixel resolving optofluidic microscope based on super resolution algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048559","htmlLink":"/document/5872653/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subpixel resolving optofluidic microscope based on super resolution algorithm","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060869S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5872707,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37404435100"},{"name":"Justin P.

The CS theory seems to be particularly advantageous in application to diffusion MRI (dMRI), where, for the same region of interest, a number of MRI scans need to be acquired in order to assess the strength of water diffusion along different spatial directions. In this paper, we propose a CS-based reconstruction method which allows a substantial reduction in the number of diffusion encoding gradients required for reliable estimation of high angular resolution diffusion imaging signals. Specifically, the method performs a CS-based reconstruction in the diffusion domain subject to two additional constraints, namely: 1) the diffusion signals have to be spatially regular, and 2) the diffusion signals have to be non-negative valued. Additionally, we detail an efficient numerical solution based on variable splitting and proximity operations, which can be used to perform the proposed reconstruction. The paper is concluded with experimental results which support the practical value of our methodology.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872708.pdf","startPage":"1597","endPage":"1601","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing of diffusion MRI data using spatial regularization and positivity constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Magnetic resonance imaging","Compressed sensing","Image resolution","Arrays","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biodiffusion","biomedical MRI","image reconstruction","medical image processing","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","diffusion MRI data","spatial regularization","positivity constraints","time-efficient reconstruction","water diffusion","diffusion encoding gradients","high angular resolution diffusion imaging signals","numerical solution","variable splitting","proximity operations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diffusion MRI","HARDI","sparse representations","spherical ridgelets","total variation","compressed sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing of diffusion MRI data using spatial regularization and positivity constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872708/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12048614","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing of diffusion MRI data using spatial regularization and positivity constraints","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047539S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5872709,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher A.

The second idea allows for a computationally efficient implementation of the reconstruction procedure, using only one circulant convolution per iteration.","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872791","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872791.pdf","startPage":"1950","endPage":"1953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast wavelet-based single-particle reconstruction in Cryo-EM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast wavelet-based single-particle reconstruction in Cryo-EM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12048695","pubMedId":"22536462","publicationDate":"March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872791/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast wavelet-based single-particle reconstruction in Cryo-EM","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0001950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041141S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5872793,"authors":[{"name":"Qianjin Feng","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qianjin","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085553573"},{"name":"Shuanqiang Li","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shuanqiang","lastName":"Li","id":"38025115000"},{"name":"Wei Yang","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Yang","id":"38238283100"},{"name":"Wufan Chen","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wufan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291853100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4127-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7928"}],"articleNumber":"5872793","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"abstract":"A novel interactive segmentation method based on distance metric learning is proposed for segmentation of tumors in CT and MRI images. Firstly, the moments of the gray-level histogram are extracted as the image features for segmentation. Then, Neighborhood Components Analysis is employed to learn a task-specific distance metric in the feature space using the interactive inputs. The probability of each pixel which belongs to the tumor and the background region is estimated by the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with the learned distance metric. The cost function for segmentation is constructed by these probabilities. Finally, the graph cut algorithm is used to optimize the cost function. The proposed method is evaluated on the CT images of liver tumors and the MR images of brain tumors. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more robust and accurate compared to the other methods using the intensity histogram and the Euclidean distance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

So far no automated approach using only single phase contrast enhancement exist. In this work, a novel fully automated algorithm to extract the pancreas from such CT images is proposed. Discriminative learning is used to build a pancreas tissue classifier that incorporates spatial relationships between the pancreas and surrounding organs and vessels. Furthermore, discrete cosine and wavelet transforms are used to build computationally inexpensive but meaningful texture features in order to describe local tissue appearance. Classification is then used to guide a constrained statistical shape model to fit the data. Cross-validation on 40 CT datasets yielded an average surface distance of 1.7 mm compared to ground truth which shows that automatic pancreas segmentation from single phase contrast enhanced CT is feasible. The method even outperforms automatic solutions using multiple-phase CT both in accuracy and computation time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pancreas","Shape","Computed tomography","Liver","Veins","Image segmentation","Adaptation model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","computerised tomography","diagnostic radiography","discrete cosine transforms","feature extraction","image classification","image enhancement","image segmentation","image texture","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic pancreas segmentation","contrast enhanced CT","learned spatial anatomy","texture descriptors","3-D computed tomography","discriminative learning","pancreas tissue classifier","discrete cosine transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","texture features","phase contrast"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computed tomography","automatic segmentation","pancreas"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872821","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783450/5872340/05872821.pdf","startPage":"2076","endPage":"2082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic pancreas segmentation in contrast enhanced CT data using learned spatial anatomy and texture descriptors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic pancreas segmentation in contrast enhanced CT data using learned spatial anatomy and texture descriptors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872821/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872821/","accessionNumber":"12048725","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic pancreas segmentation in contrast enhanced CT data using learned spatial anatomy and texture descriptors","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0002076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.162538S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5872823,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Kr\u010dah","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic","Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Kr\u010dah","id":"38016548800"},{"name":"G\u00e1bor Sz\u00e9kely","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"G\u00e1bor","lastName":"Sz\u00e9kely","id":"37326053800"},{"name":"R\u00e9mi Blanc","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"R\u00e9mi","lastName":"Blanc","id":"38243227200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4127-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4128-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"CD","value":"1945-7928"}],"articleNumber":"5872823","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1090},"abstract":"Statistical shape and intensity modelling have been subject to an increasing interest within the past decade.

such as the wavelet transform are useful for many signal processing tasks. Graphs are flexible models to represent complex networks and a spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT) has recently been developed as a generalization of conventional wavelet designs. Here we extend the SGWT to obtain a Parseval frame, which conserves energy in the transformed domain and makes the reconstruction easy. Moreover, we also show how to deal with negative edge weights. We then apply the modified SGWT to brain functional connectivity data from two different conditions. This shows that the transform that is adapted to the condition, more efficiently captures coherent activity between inter-connected brain regions. The extended SGWT holds promise for the spatial analysis of fMRI data because it captures coherent activity of distinct brain regions that are functionally connected.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872835/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12048739","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5872835/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet frames on graphs defined by fMRI functional connectivity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet frames on graphs defined by fMRI functional connectivity","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0002136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04589S","chronDate":"March 30 2011-April 2 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783450","isNumber":"5872340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783450","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5872340","articleId":"5872835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5872859,"authors":[{"name":"Dominic FitzPatrick","affiliation":["PoweRFul Microwave, Ryde, Isle of Wight, UK"],"firstName":"Dominic","lastName":"FitzPatrick","id":"37738048900"},{"name":"R.

By applying this novel filter, third harmonic can be suppressed while for fundamental frequency, the filter works as a 50-Ohm transmission line with little insertion loss. With the interdigital hairpin line structure of the filter, the blocking capacitor is not needed in the load matching network.

Specifically, a sensor relocation method is introduced, based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The algorithm objectives are the total travel distance of the sensors from their initial locations to their final locations as well as the coverage area of the sensors. Simulation results clearly show the tradeoff between the travelled distance and coverage area. This algorithm can be used to achieve best coverage, and our results demonstrate that a better coverage always needs a larger travelled distance. Furthermore, redundant sensors decrease the travelled distance. The travelled distance also depends on the initial position of the sensors. The proposed algorithm also works when obstacles appear in the sensing field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872882/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12061769","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872882/","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","conferenceDate":"18-19 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Relocation of wireless sensor network nodes using a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relocation of wireless sensor network nodes using a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Clearwater Beach, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"5390099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050065S","chronDate":"18-19 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783448","isNumber":"5872849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783448","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5872849","articleId":"5872882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5872883,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Gorcin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Gorcin","id":"37398564600"},{"name":"Hasari Celebi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Hasari","lastName":"Celebi","id":"37410115200"},{"name":"Khalid A.

The presented amplifier exhibits an output signal with peak-to-peak voltages up to 60 V and achieves a broadband output power of 17 W with a PAE of 79.5 % at 0.9 Gbps. Considering a bit rate of 5.2 Gbps, the corresponding values are 40 V, 4 W and 38.6 %.

WSNs suffer of some problems such as limited processing capability, low storage capacity, limited time of testing and limited reliability. The Compressed sensing theory holds promising improvements to these parameters. Compressed Sensing shows that spars signals such as signals of WSNs can be exactly reconstructed from a small number of random linear measurements. With this in mind, we introduce a new mechanism of testing in wireless sensor network with compressed sensing theory in order to design a robust WSN with high reliability factor. This paper gives a background of compressed sensing theory, and then describes important concepts in wireless sensor networks, and finally our research combines the compressed sensing theory with wireless sensor network to introduce a new method for testing of wireless sensor networks with compressed sensing theory.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783451/5872911/05872918.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2011.5872918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2011.5872918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872911","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing the reliability of wireless sensor network with a new testing approach based on compressed sensing theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Testing","Compressed sensing","Wireless communication","Sensors","Reliability theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal reconstruction","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network reliability","compressed sensing theory","WSN","wireless nodes","random linear measurements","wireless sensor network testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Wireless sensor networks","Software testing","Reliability","Wireless node"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5872918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Increasing the reliability of wireless sensor network with a new testing approach based on compressed sensing theory","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5872918/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12048752","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","conferenceDate":"24-26 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing the reliability of wireless sensor network with a new testing approach based on compressed sensing theory","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"s013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083641S","chronDate":"24-26 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783451","isNumber":"5872911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783451","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5872911","articleId":"5872918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5872931,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Xiao","affiliation":["Wuhan Maritime Communications Research Institute, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38026208600"},{"name":"Zhang Nan","affiliation":["Wuhan Maritime Communications Research Institute, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Nan","id":"37066065400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0261-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0262-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0260-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"}],"articleNumber":"5872931","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5872931","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Sufficient conditions","Turbo codes","Arrays","Linear matrix inequalities","Shipbuilding industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QC-LDPC codes","quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes","balanced cycles","minimal matrices","B-girth","mother matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Girth","quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes","balanced cycles"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze balanced cycles of quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes.

We will try to present some key anomaly detection methods applicable in the data mining process. Some methods are existing techniques as the DBSCAN algorithm and some have just been presented to the public recently and could be the answer to future anomaly detection development. One example is the filtering-and-refinement approach, a new general two stage technique for more efficient and effective anomaly detection. This paper will try to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the classical techniques presented but as we will see the results are completely dependent on the data sets that are analyzed. We will emphasize on efficiency, robustness and accuracy. We will also try to demonstrate a hybrid approach obtained by combining the filtering-and-refinement method with the DBSCAN algorithm. In our experiments we pursued to compare the performance of the normal DBSCAN algorithm with the performance of the hybrid one. Our results indicate that the hybrid method is more accurate in terms of detecting anomalies and far superior in terms of speed than the normal DBSCAN algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SACI.2011.5872976","publicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783419/5872967/05872976.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SACI.2011.5872976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5872967","startPage":"75","endPage":"83","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection in data mining.

Neural networks are an interesting application for which an ASIP can be tailored to increase performance, lower power consumption and/or increase throughput. Here, both the bidirectional associative memory and hopfield auto-associative memory networks are run through an automated instruction-set identification algorithm to identify and select custom instruction candidates suitable for neural network applications. Clusters of neural networks are highly parallel, and therefore it is interesting to consider a homogeneous multiprocessor composed of ASIPs. The two legacy neural network applications showed a 18-120% improvement with the automatic hardware/software partitioning for a uniprocessor ASIP. However, due to pointers and function calling which did not resolve to hardware, the acceleration was concentrated in the network initialization part of the code.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873060/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12048166","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873060/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ASIPs for artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASIPs for artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Timisoara, Romania","sourcePdf":"096saci2011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083036S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783419","isNumber":"5872967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783419","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5872967","articleId":"5873060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5873117,"authors":[{"name":"Hee-Dong Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hee-Dong","lastName":"Kim","id":"38258187700"},{"name":"Ho-Myoung An","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ho-Myoung","lastName":"An","id":"37531229500"},{"name":"Yujeong Seo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yujeong","lastName":"Seo","id":"37674579700"},{"name":"Tae Geun Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae Geun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37349875600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5873117","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1450},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"This letter covers the fabrication of a transparent resistive random access memory (T-ReRAM) device using ITO/AlN/ITO capacitors and its observed resistive switching characteristics.

We also introduce a closed-form expression for selecting the regularization parameter. With this selection of the regularization parameter, we show that the convex regularized RLS algorithm performs as well as, and possibly better than, the regular RLS when there is a constraint on the value of the convex function evaluated at the true weight vector.

First of all, a finite-time controller is designed to solve finite-time attitude tracking problem for a single spacecraft. Rigorous proof shows that the desired attitude can be tracked in finite time in the absence of disturbances. In the presence of disturbances, the tracking errors can reach a region around the origin in finite time. Then, based on the neighbor rule, a distributed finite-time attitude control law is proposed for a group of spacecraft with a leader-follower architecture. Under the finite-time control law, the attitude synchronization can be achieved in finite time.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2159419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6062566/05873126.pdf","startPage":"2711","endPage":"2717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2159419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Time Attitude Tracking Control of Spacecraft With Application to Attitude Synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873126/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Time Attitude Tracking Control of Spacecraft With Application to Attitude Synchronization","volume":"56","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328661","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873126/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Time Attitude Tracking Control of Spacecraft With Application to Attitude Synchronization","sourcePdf":"tac-li-2159419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148391S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6062566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"483","xplore-issue":"6062566","articleId":"5873126","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5873129,"authors":[{"name":"Chunguang Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563672/6097099/5873129/5873129-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunguang Li received the M.Sc. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems and the Ph.D. degree in circuits and systems from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

It first considers a two-state HMM, i.e., a Gilbert-Elliott process, to model the bit-planes produced by DVC schemes. A statistical analysis shows that this model allows us to accurately capture the memory present in the video bit-planes. The achievable rate bounds are derived for these ergodic sources, first assuming an additive binary symmetric correlation channel between the two sources. These bounds show that a rate gain can be achieved by exploiting the sources memory with the additive BSC model. A Slepian-Wolf decoding algorithm which jointly estimates the sources and the source model parameters is then described. Simulation results show that the additive correlation model does not always fit well with the correlation between the actual video bit-planes. This has led us to consider a second correlation model (the predictive model). The rate bounds are then derived for the predictive correlation model in the case of memory sources, showing that exploiting the source memory does not bring any rate gain and that the noise statistic is a sufficient statistic for the MAP decoder. We also evaluate the rate loss when the correlation model assumed by the decoder is not matched to the true one. An a posteriori estimation of the correlation channel has hence been added to the decoder in order to use the most appropriate correlation model for each bit-plane. The new decoding algorithm has been integrated in a DVC decoder, leading to a rate saving of up to 10.14% for the same PSNR, with respect to the case where the bit-planes are assumed to be memoryless uniform sources correlated with the SI via an additive channel model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","volume":"22","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12524312","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5873137/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Source Modeling for Distributed Video Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Source Modeling for Distributed Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-totozarasoa-2159429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092441S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6145208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6145208","articleId":"5873137","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-26"},{"_id":5873142,"authors":[{"name":"Takenori Atsumi","affiliation":["Research and Development Group, Hitachi and Limited, Fujisawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6191366/5873142/5873142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takenori Atsumi (M'07) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Chiba University, Chiba, Japan, in 1997, 1999, and 2006, respectively.","Since 1999, he has been with the Research and Development Group, Hitachi, Ltd., Fujisawa, Japan.

We define the index of unobservable position based on its rms amplitude to estimate the effect of the unobservable oscillations of mechanical resonances in positioning control systems. This index shows that a sampling frequency and a number of samples of measurement data for estimating the unobservable magnitude of oscillations are important parameters which designers must choose carefully.

Starting from the voltage source inverter and the current source rectifier, the basics of space vector modulation are summarized. Based on that, the topology of the indirect matrix converter (IMC) and its modulation are gradually developed from a voltage dc-link back-to-back converter by omitting the dc-link capacitor. In the next step, the topology of the conventional (direct) matrix converter (CMC) is introduced, and the relationship between the IMC and the CMCs is discussed in a figurative manner by investigating the switching states. Subsequently, three-phase ac-ac buck-type chopper circuits are considered as a special case of matrix converters (MCs), and a summary of extended MC topologies is provided, including three-level and hybrid MCs. Therewith, a common knowledge basis of the individual converter topologies is established.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2159353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6011706/05873144.pdf","startPage":"4988","endPage":"5006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2159353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Review of Three-Phase PWM AC\u2013AC Converter Topologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873144/","displayDocTitle":"Review of Three-Phase PWM AC\u2013AC Converter Topologies","volume":"58","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12216257","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873144/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of Three-Phase PWM AC\u2013AC Converter Topologies","sourcePdf":"tie-friedli-2159353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142103S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6011706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"354","xplore-issue":"6011706","articleId":"5873144","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5873149,"authors":[{"name":"Mari Kobayashi","affiliation":["Telecommunications Department, SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","Telecommunications department of SUPELEC, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5983315/5873149/5873149-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mari Kobayashi (M'06) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Keio University, Yokohama, Japan, in 1999, and the M.S. degree in mobile radio and the Ph.D. degree from Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Paris, France, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","From November 2005 to March 2007, she was a postdoctoral researcher at Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.

It has been known that the secrecy capacity of such a channel does not scale with signal-to-noise ratio under general conditions. Taking into account the different temporal fading structures at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, we characterize lower and upper bounds on the secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) of the channel at hand. Our results show that a positive s.d.o.f. can be ensured whenever two receivers experience the asynchronous variation. Remarkably, simple linear precoding schemes provide the optimal s.d.o.f. in most cases of interest by aligning either the confidential signal at the eavesdropper or the artificial noise at the legitimate receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/5983315/05873149.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2159376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2159376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983315","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Secrecy Degrees of Freedom of the Multiantenna Block Fading Wiretap Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Fading","Coherence","Upper bound","MIMO","Compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","Gaussian channels","linear codes","precoding","radio receivers","radio transmitters","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secrecy degrees of freedom","multiantenna block fading wiretap channels","Gaussian multiantenna wiretap channel","channel state information","confidential message","legitimate receiver","eavesdropper","secrecy capacity","signal-to-noise ratio","temporal fading structures","asynchronous variation","linear precoding","artificial noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel state information","information security","multiple antennas","time-varying channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"On the Secrecy Degrees of Freedom of the Multiantenna Block Fading Wiretap Channels","volume":"6","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5873149/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205668","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Secrecy Degrees of Freedom of the Multiantenna Block Fading Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"tifs-kobayashi-2159376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089306S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"5983315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5983315","articleId":"5873149","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5873151,"authors":[{"name":"Chulwoo Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6106034/5873151/5873151-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chulwoo Lee received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2008, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His research topics include power-constrained image/video enhancement and high dynamic range imaging."]},"firstName":"Chulwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37599676800"},{"name":"Chul Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6106034/5873151/5873151-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Chul Lee (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2003 and 2008, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","From 2002 to 2006, he was with Biospace Inc., Seoul, Korea, where he was involved in the development of medical equipment.

We propose a tumor-customized downhill (TCD) method to achieve these objectives. Our approach includes: 1) automatic formulation of a tumor-customized criterion to improve tumor boundary definition, 2) a monotonic property of the standardized uptake value (SUV) of tumors to separate the tumor from adjacent regions of increased metabolism (\u201chot spot\u201d), and 3) accounts for tumor heterogeneity. Three simulated lesions and 30 PET-CT studies, grouped into \u201csimple\u201d and \u201ccomplex\u201d groups, were used for evaluation. Our main findings are that TCD, when compared to the threshold based on 40% and 50% maximum SUV, adaptive threshold, Fuzzy c-means, and watershed techniques achieved the highest Dice's similarity coefficient average for simulation data (0.73) and \u201ccomplex\u201d group (0.71); the least volumetric error in the \u201csimple\u201d (1.76 mL) and the \u201ccomplex\u201d group (14.59 mL); and TCD solves the problem of leakage into adjacent tissues when many other techniques fail.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Positron emission tomography","Lungs","Computed tomography","Lesions","Pixel","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image segmentation","lung","medical image processing","positron emission tomography","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated lung tumor delineation","PET images","monotonicity","tumor customized criterion","positron emission tomography","tumor boundary definition","lung tumor separation","tumor customized downhill method","TCD method","monotonic property","standardized uptake value","tumor SUV","tumor heterogeneity","Dice's similarity coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lung tumor segmentation","nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)","positron emission tomography (PET)","tumor delineation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Automation","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung","Humans","Lung Neoplasms","Positron-Emission Tomography"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2011.2159307","startPage":"691","endPage":"702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/6008174/05873153.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2011.2159307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Delineation of Lung Tumors in PET Images Based on Monotonicity and a Tumor-Customized Criterion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automated Delineation of Lung Tumors in PET Images Based on Monotonicity and a Tumor-Customized Criterion","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12216118","pubMedId":"21672678","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","volume":"15","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873153/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Delineation of Lung Tumors in PET Images Based on Monotonicity and a Tumor-Customized Criterion","sourcePdf":"titb-ballangan-2159307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088708S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"6008174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6008174","articleId":"5873153","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5873156,"authors":[{"name":"Hesong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK","School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6112283/5873156/5873156-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hesong Liu received the B.Eng. degree from the Department of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2005.

The proposed method consists of two parts. The first part utilizes the voltage differences between the input and output of a minimum-magnitude-error over-modulation block to modify the d-axis current references. The second part uses the compensated q-axis voltage, in which the resistive voltage drop and the distorted voltage due to inverter nonlinearities are taken into account, to detect the maximum torque per voltage (MTPV) line. Under the MTPV condition, a PI controller with a low-pass filter is presented to modify the q-axis current reference. With these two parts, the bus voltage utilization in the proposed method is close to the six-step operation and the actual current trajectory approaches the ideal MTPV line. As a result, the drive performance in the whole flux-weakening region is optimized in terms of maximizing the output torque/power. The method also shows a good performance in transient response. Effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed method are verified by experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2159398","startPage":"942","endPage":"952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2159398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112283","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6112283/05873156.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flux-Weakening Control of Nonsalient Pole PMSM Having Large Winding Inductance, Accounting for Resistive Voltage Drop and Inverter Nonlinearities","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873156/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Flux-Weakening Control of Nonsalient Pole PMSM Having Large Winding Inductance, Accounting for Resistive Voltage Drop and Inverter Nonlinearities","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5873156/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12436971","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flux-Weakening Control of Nonsalient Pole PMSM Having Large Winding Inductance, Accounting for Resistive Voltage Drop and Inverter Nonlinearities","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2159398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066552S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6112283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6112283","articleId":"5873156","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5873166,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammed Bolatkale","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5995181/5873166/5873166-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Muhammed Bolatkale (M'07) was born in Istanbul, Turkey, in 1981.

After single-temperature trimming, it achieves a maximum offset of \u00b1 30 \u03bcV and an offset drift of 0.33 \u03bcV/\u00b0C (3\u03c3) over the temperature range of -40\u00b0C to +125\u00b0C.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5873166/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12190315","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Single-Temperature Trimming Technique for MOS-Input Operational Amplifiers Achieving 0.33 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>V/<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^{\\circ}$</tex></formula>C Offset Drift","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Single-Temperature Trimming Technique for MOS-Input Operational Amplifiers Achieving 0.33 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>V/<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^{\\circ}$</tex></formula>C Offset Drift","sourcePdf":"jssc-bolatkale-2139530-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066735S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5995181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5995181","articleId":"5873166","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5873167,"authors":[{"name":"ChuanKang Liang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA","MediaTek USA, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5995181/5873167/5873167-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["ChuanKang Liang (S'05\u2013M'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU), Taiwan, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2009.

These systems are known as discrete-event dynamic systems (DEDSs), where simulation is the only faithful way for performance evaluation. Due to various advantages in practice, designs (or solution candidates) with low descriptive complexity (called simple designs) are usually preferred over complex ones when their performances are close. However, the descriptive complexity (DC) is usually nonlinear and takes discrete value, which makes traditional methods such as linear programming and gradient-based local search not applicable. Existing methods for simulation-based optimization (SBO) do not explore the preference on descriptive complexity and thus cannot solve the problem efficiently. The major contributions of this paper are to point out the importance of considering SBO problems with DC preference, and to develop an adaptive sampling algorithm (ASA) to find the simplest good design. It is shown that ASA terminates within finite iterations and with controllable probability of making mistake. The computational complexity of ASA and its dependence on various parameters are discussed. ASA is then applied to three parameter optimization problems and a node activation policy optimization problem in a wireless sensor network. Numerical results show that ASA is more efficient than blind picking and Levin search in most cases. We hope this work can shed some insight to how to find simple and good designs in general.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational complexity","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Adaptive algorithms","Wireless sensor networks","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","discrete event systems","gradient methods","linear programming","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive sampling algorithm","simulation based optimization","descriptive complexity preference","discrete event dynamic systems","performance evaluation","linear programming","gradient based local search","finite iterations","computational complexity","blind picking","Levin search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Descriptive complexity","discrete event dynamic system (DEDS)","simulation-based optimization (SBO)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TASE.2011.2158000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/6025294/05873169.pdf","startPage":"720","endPage":"731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6025294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2011.2158000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Simulation-Based Optimization With Descriptive Complexity Preference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Simulation-Based Optimization With Descriptive Complexity Preference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873169/","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873169/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12270692","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Simulation-Based Optimization With Descriptive Complexity Preference","sourcePdf":"tase-jia-2158000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11111S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"6025294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6025294","articleId":"5873169","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5873172,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun-Bae Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/6069619/5873172/5873172-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyun-Bae Jeon received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2011.

The proposed scheme considerably reduces the computational complexity without sacrificing BER and PAPR reduction performance only by requiring additional memory to save the additive mapping signal sequences, especially for the OFDM system with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).

As a PA is driven into saturated operation, the current source of the device generates a large third harmonic current, which creates a quasi-rectangular current waveform. The large nonlinear output capacitor of the transistor generates a second harmonic voltage with a very small third harmonic component. The second harmonic voltage is in-phase with the fundamental voltage, making a half-sine wave voltage waveform with voltage peaking. These waveforms are similar to those of a class F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n .

However, the required harmonic impedances are just larger than the impedance levels of the output capacitance for both the second and third harmonics. Therefore, the circuit topology is similar to that of a class E amplifier, which is very simple.

To support this demand by innovative and resourceful use of technology, future communication systems will have to shift towards higher carrier frequencies. Due to the tight regulatory situation, frequencies in the atmospheric attenuation window around 300 GHz appear very attractive to facilitate an indoor, short range, ultra high speed THz communication system. In this paper, we investigate the influence of diffuse scattering at such high frequencies on the characteristics of the communication channel and its implications on the non-line-of-sight propagation path. The Kirchhoff approach is verified by an experimental study of diffuse scattering from randomly rough surfaces commonly encountered in indoor environments using a fiber-coupled terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system to perform angle- and frequency-dependent measurements. Furthermore, we integrate the Kirchhoff approach into a self-developed ray tracing algorithm to model the signal coverage of a typical office scenario.","doi":"10.1109/TTHZ.2011.2153610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503871/6047823/05873179.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTHZ.2011.2153610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diffuse Scattering From Rough Surfaces in THz Communication Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Diffuse Scattering From Rough Surfaces in THz Communication Channels","volume":"1","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12318420","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873179/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873179/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diffuse Scattering From Rough Surfaces in THz Communication Channels","sourcePdf":"tthz-jansen-2153610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119643S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"6047823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6047823","articleId":"5873179","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5873180,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The proposed method overcomes the constraint of fixed sensing resolution in spectrum sensors based on conventional discrete Fourier transform filter banks (DFTFB). The flexibility in realizing multiple sensing resolution spectrum sensor is achieved by suitably designing the prototype filter and efficiently selecting the varying resolution subbands without hardware re-implementation. Design examples show that the sensing performance of proposed MRFB is comparable to that of conventional fixed resolution DFTFB. The complexity comparison shows that the proposed MRFB architecture has a gate count reduction of 36.5% over the DFTFB.

New Cell-to-Cell Interference Induced by Conduction Band Distortion near S/D Region in Scaled NAND Flash Memories","abstract":"A new cell-to-cell interference phenomenon has been found beyond sub 40nm node. Unlike capacitive coupling between floating gates, the threshold voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TH</sub>\n) shift of interfered cell becomes significantly large beyond some V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TH</sub>\n of interfering cell. This is due to conduction band distortion near source and drain regions. In NAND Flash, drain and source are not biased directly but influenced by adjacent floating gate (FG) potential in small dimension. We named this new phenomenon Floating-gate Induced Barrier enhancement (FIBE). The model is confirmed by experiment and simulation. To reduce FIBE, asymmetric S/D junction structure and the bias scheme by using variable read voltage are suggested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12061810","htmlLink":"/document/5873199/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A New Cell-to-Cell Interference Induced by Conduction Band Distortion near S/D Region in Scaled NAND Flash Memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Cell-to-Cell Interference Induced by Conduction Band Distortion near S/D Region in Scaled NAND Flash Memories","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074194S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871161","isNumber":"5873182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871161","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5873182","articleId":"5873199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5873201,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Wu","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37535047400"},{"name":"Guiqiang Dong","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"firstName":"Guiqiang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37401641100"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0226-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0225-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0224-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-483X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-4864"}],"articleNumber":"5873201","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":811},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873201","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Threshold voltage","Heat recovery","Analytical models","Noise","Encapsulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-healing solid-state drive design strategy","heat-accelerated interface trap recovery","system-level redundancy","thermal modeling","memory cell device modeling","NAND flash memory chip"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a self-healing solid-state drive (SSD) design strategy that exploits heat-accelerated interface trap recovery of NAND flash memory cells to largely improve the SSD lifetime.

Based upon detailed thermal modeling and memory cell device modeling, we carried out simulations and analysis, and the results show that this proposed design strategy can potentially improve SSD lifetime by one order of magnitude at reasonable energy consumption overhead.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2011.5873201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2011.5873201","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871161/5873182/05873201.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A First Study on Self-Healing Solid-State Drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A First Study on Self-Healing Solid-State Drives","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873201/","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12061812","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873201/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A First Study on Self-Healing Solid-State Drives","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057205S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871161","isNumber":"5873182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871161","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5873182","articleId":"5873201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5873202,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This novel cell consists of one cylindrical FG with a line type control gate (CG) and S-SCG structure. For simplifying the process flow, we realized the common S-SCG lines by using the pre-stacked poly silicon layer, through which variable medium voltages are applied not only to control the electrically inverted S/D region but also to assist the program and erase operation. We successfully demonstrate the normal flash cell operation and show its superior performances in comparison with the conventional 3-D NAND cells by using the cylindrical 3-D device simulation. It is shown that the proposed cell can realize the highest CG coupling ratio, low voltage cell operation of program with 15V at Vth=4V and erase with 7V at Vth=-2V and good on/off read current margin by an order of over 1.5. Moreover, the proposed S-SCG cell array can fully suppress both the interference effects and the disturbance problems at the same time by removing the direct coupling effect in the same cell string, which are the most critical problems of the recent 3-D vertical stacked cell structures. Above all, the proposed cell array has good potential for Terabit 3-D vertical NAND flash cell array with highly reliable multi level cell (MLC) operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12061819","htmlLink":"/document/5873208/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel 3-D Vertical FG NAND Flash Memory Cell Arrays Using the Separated Sidewall Control Gate (S-SCG) for Highly Reliable MLC Operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel 3-D Vertical FG NAND Flash Memory Cell Arrays Using the Separated Sidewall Control Gate (S-SCG) for Highly Reliable MLC Operation","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049852S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871161","isNumber":"5873182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871161","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5873182","articleId":"5873208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5873209,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Distribution function of the trapped charge is found through mapping of ERS tunneling current.

In phase-change memory (PCM), however, MLC storage is seriously hampered by the phenomenon of resistance drift. Reference cells may be used to offer some relief, however their effectiveness is limited due to the stochastic nature of drift. In this paper, an alternative way to cope with drift in PCM is introduced, based on modulation coding. The new drift tolerant coding technique encodes information in the relative order of resistance levels in a codeword. Experimental results from a 90-nm PCM prototype chip demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in offering high resilience to drift.

The improved stability of amorphous phase in Te-rich materials gives rise to higher data retention in our devices.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2011.5873232","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871161/5873182/05873232.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2011.5873232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical Performances of Tellurium-Rich GexTe1-x Phase Change Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Electrical Performances of Tellurium-Rich GexTe1-x Phase Change Memories","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12061843","htmlLink":"/document/5873232/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical Performances of Tellurium-Rich GexTe1-x Phase Change Memories","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063242S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871161","isNumber":"5873182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871161","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5873182","articleId":"5873232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5873233,"authors":[{"name":"Xizhen Zhang","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Xizhen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37898411800"},{"name":"Kousuke Miyaji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kousuke","lastName":"Miyaji","id":"37394979200"},{"name":"Mitsue Takahashi","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsue","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37307742100"},{"name":"Ken Takeuchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37323717800"},{"name":"Shigeki Sakai","affiliation":["National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeki","lastName":"Sakai","id":"37284183300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0226-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0225-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0224-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-483X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-4864"}],"articleNumber":"5873233","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873233","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory","Programming","Arrays","Transistors","Silicon","Nonvolatile memory","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferroelectric storage","flash memories","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-line-voltage self-boost-programming","ferroelectric-NAND Flash Memory","miniature memory cell array","power consumption","voltage 0.5 V"]}],"abstract":"Self-boost-programming for ferroelectric-NAND (Fe-NAND) flash memory was investigated by using a miniature memory cell array, which could reduce bit-line voltages for programming.

In order to keep pace with the Moore's Law, the scale chip dimensions decrease to the point where variability effects become significant. Particularly, when printed features go down below the 20 nm, transistors structures are strongly affected by pattern roughness caused by the randomness in advanced lithographies (e.g. Extreme UV), leading to variability induced data errors in the memory functionality. Two treatments for variability are known: roughness smoothing processes at the process stage and on-chip error correcting algorithms. This paper describes a holistic framework, which trades-off between lithography processes and error control codes complexity to ensure data integrity in probabilistic 16 nm memories.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2011.5873235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2011.5873235","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871161/5873182/05873235.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bridging Lithography Processes with NAND Flash ECC Complexity","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12061846","htmlLink":"/document/5873235/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bridging Lithography Processes with NAND Flash ECC Complexity","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077668S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871161","isNumber":"5873182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871161","xplore-issue":"5873182","articleId":"5873235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5873236,"authors":[{"name":"F.

On the basis of RBF and BP neural network, the theory and method of analog circuits fault diagnosis based on ANN (Artificial Neural Network) are described. By the way of hybrid programming with LabVIEW and Matlab, the API for analog circuits fault diagnosis is established.

To solve this problem, a scatterer template-based method is proposed in this paper. The key idea of the proposed method is that the inertia of the sampled image with the maximum energy, not the inertia of the original image, is used to estimate the orientation of the MIMO radar image. Because only part of the image at the stored parameter of high-energy scatterers is involved in the calculation of the inertia and because the noise and clutter outside the sampling locations is filtered, more robust performance can be obtained by the proposed method compared with the existed moment method. Numerical simulations are used to test the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ISA.2011.5873384","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Workshop on Intelligent Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871829/5873244/05873384.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISA.2011.5873384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873244","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Orientation Estimation of MIMO Radar Images: Method and Results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Orientation Estimation of MIMO Radar Images: Method and Results","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873384/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-29 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12061985","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5873384/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Orientation Estimation of MIMO Radar Images: Method and Results","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032781S","chronDate":"28-29 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871829","isNumber":"5873244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871829","xplore-issue":"5873244","articleId":"5873384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5873387,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Yuan","firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Yuan"},{"name":"Xiaosen Shan","firstName":"Xiaosen","lastName":"Shan"},{"name":"Li Su","firstName":"Li","lastName":"Su"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9857-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9855-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5873387","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":606},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Pixel","Histograms","Training","Accuracy","Humans","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Haar transforms","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","support vector machines","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pedestrian detection method","Haar-like features","HOG features","rectangular features","human characteristics","detection speed","AdaBoost learning method","classifier training","support vector machine","histograms of oriented gradients"]}],"abstract":"Considering the simplicity and fast training speed of Haar-like features, the high detecting precision of HOG features, a combined method is proposed on the basis of the two features.

The insertion of lumped capacitor within resonator increases the effective capacitance, and reduces the resonant frequency, so the dimensions of the filter will reduce and the performance of the filter will be improved by enhancing the energy stored in the resonator. A Second order band pass filter with centre frequency of 2.4 GHz has been designed, fabricated and measured. The filter has a wide stop band with a rejection higher than 20 dB up to more than 10 GHz.

Furthermore, their decreased cell sizes provide improved cell capacity through increased spatial reuse. However, co-channel interference is one of the most critical challenges facing LTE femtocell deployment. This paper proposes to use Femtocell Identification (FID) approach to avoid co-channel interference between neighbour femtocells without operator intervention. Each femtocell has to cognitively detect other femtocells FID and their frequency allocation from the network environment and allocate the unoccupied resource blocks for interference avoidance. FID is designed such that each resource blocks assignment to a femtocell has a unique FID frequency allocation that distinguishes this assignment. Each femtocell through its FID allocation sends a message to the nearby femtocells. The simulation results show that the FID detection can be achieved even at low SNR region.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783416/5873575/05873597.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873575","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocells interference avoidance using Femtocell Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocells interference avoidance","femtocell identification","indoor coverage","LTE cellular system","cell capacity","co-channel interference","LTE femtocell deployment","frequency allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","Macrocell","Interference Avoidance","Femtocell Identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873597/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Femtocells interference avoidance using Femtocell Identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873597/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12061692","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocells interference avoidance using Femtocell Identification","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"C12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069099S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783416","isNumber":"5873575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783416","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5873575","articleId":"5873597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5873599,"authors":[{"name":"Hany Ismail","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Hany","lastName":"Ismail","id":"38020386600"},{"name":"Essam Sourour","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Essam","lastName":"Sourour","id":"37320987600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-804-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-805-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-803-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5873599","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":675},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink interference mitigation","two-tier LTE femtocell network","cellular base station","macrocell system","LTE wireless mobile system","femto access point","FAP","random resources assignment","fractional frequency reuse","FFR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","Femtocell","Fractional frequency reuse","Closed subscriber group","Interference mitigation"]}],"abstract":"Femtocells are low-power, very small-service-area (e.g. home or office environment) cellular base stations that will significantly impact the cellular landscape in the next several years.

Then a study of the effect on the macro-cell neighboring users for the cases of the LTE system with random resources assignment, and the case of a new resources assignment procedure proposed for the closed subscriber group FAPs based on the Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) of the macro base stations. The performance of the model is evaluated throughout system level simulations and it is shown that insertion of FAPs has some benefits and some drawbacks on the network, and it is also shown that the using of the proposed assignment procedure overcomes some of these drawbacks.","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873599","publicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783416/5873575/05873599.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink interference mitigation for two-tier LTE femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873599/","displayDocTitle":"Downlink interference mitigation for two-tier LTE femtocell networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12061694","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873599/","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink interference mitigation for two-tier LTE femtocell networks","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"C14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051021S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783416","isNumber":"5873575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783416","xplore-issue":"5873575","articleId":"5873599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5873600,"authors":[{"name":"Mofreh El- Gendy","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mofreh","lastName":"El- Gendy","id":"37085921443"},{"name":"Essam Sourour","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Essam","lastName":"Sourour","id":"37320987600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-804-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-805-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-803-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5873600","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Phase shift keying","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Modulation coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","subscriber loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-tier LTE femtocell network","indoor coverage","OFDMA-based femtocell","cross-layer co-channel interference","overlaid network","closed subscribers group","open access femtocells","closed access method","open access method","hybrid access method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","Access methods","Femtocell","Downlink"]}],"abstract":"Femtocells are a promising solution for the provision of high indoor coverage and capacity. Furthermore, OFDMA-based femtocells have proven to be highly versatile when dealing with cross-layer co-channel interference; however, concerns still exist related to the impact of the different access methods to femtocells in an overlaid network. Femtocells based on a Closed Subscribers group, where only device owners are allowed to connect, introduce severe interference to microcells' users. On the other hand, Open Access femtocells where any user can connect, does not bring many advantages to the femtocell owner. In this paper, a study of the two types of access methods (Closed & Open Access) is proposed and a discussion of how to overcome their drawbacks by using the Hybrid access method is presented, which allows all users to connect but under restrictions. The performance of the model is evaluated throughout system level simulations and it is shown that Hybrid access contributes to seriously improve the performance of the whole network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of access methods effect on the performance of two-tier LTE femtocell networks","publicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873600","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783416/5873575/05873600.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873575","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A study of access methods effect on the performance of two-tier LTE femtocell networks","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873600/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12061695","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of access methods effect on the performance of two-tier LTE femtocell networks","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"C15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102489S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783416","isNumber":"5873575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783416","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5873575","articleId":"5873600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5873603,"authors":[{"name":"Maged Ahmed","affiliation":["M.

CS aim to reconstruct signals and images from significantly fewer measurements. With CS it's possible to make an accurate reconstruction from small number of samples (measurements). Doppler ultrasound is an important technique for non-invasively detecting and measuring the velocity of moving structure, and particularly blood, within the body. Doppler ultrasound signal has been reconstructed with CS by using random sampling and non-uniform sampling via \u21131-norm to generate Doppler sonogram. The result show that the recovered signals with non-uniform sampling are the same as the original signal, there is a loss of very small peaks, when random sampling used for recovering the signals, there is no significant different between the original signal and reconstructed one when we used more than 85% of the data, when less than 85% of the data used, the reconstructed signals and the original signal are different. The sonograms generated from the reconstructed signals with random and non-uniform sampling are same as the original one, but there are some losses in contrast. The error of the reconstructed images was calculated, the result shows that the error in the image decreased with increasing the number of samples.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783416/5873575/05873610.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873575","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing: Doppler ultrasound signal recovery by using non-uniform sampling & random sampling","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler ultrasound signal recovery","compressed sensing","CS","image reconstruction","Doppler sonogram","random sampling","nonuniform sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","sparsity","Doppler ultrasound","\u21131-norm","non-uniform sampling","signal & image processing","random sampling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing: Doppler ultrasound signal recovery by using non-uniform sampling & random sampling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873610/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12061705","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing: Doppler ultrasound signal recovery by using non-uniform sampling & random sampling","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"C24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08103S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783416","isNumber":"5873575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783416","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5873575","articleId":"5873610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5873618,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Mohamed","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mansoura University:, Egypt"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"37085918649"},{"name":"B.M.

The performance of the proposed FSK-OCDMA system is compared with the performance of the existence Pulse Position Modulation (PPM)'OCDMA system. The simulated computer results reveal that the performance of the proposed technique is superior to the performance of the PPM technique in terms of lower bit error rate (BER) and higher bit-rate under the same conditions. Also, the results indicate that the proposed scheme is very power efficient and when the bit-rate is constant; its network capacity can be expanded to accommodate great number of simultaneous active users with low error-rate.

Spectrum sensing methods are often used for finding free channels to be used by CR. In this paper, one of spectrum sensing method will be investigated. This method is cooperative spectrum sensing which is based on energy detection in CR networks in order to overcome fading, noise and shadowing effects on individual CR user and increase the reliability and efficiency of spectrum sensing. The sensing information from CR users combines at the Fusion center (common receiver) by soft combination or conventional hard combination techniques. Soft combination has excellent performance but, it requires a lot of overhead for feedback observation. In contrast, the conventional hard combination scheme requires only one bit of overhead, but it has worst performance because of loss of information caused by local hard decisions. In this paper, the detection performance improves by increasing the levels of local observations by proposing three-bit softened decision scheme which is not clarified until now. Analytical Expressions of proposed three bits scheme will be derived. Design parameters are optimized to find the detection performance with a given false alarm probability. The simulation results show that, at 90% detection probability, the cooperative signal detection improves by 1.75 dB of signal to noise ratio over conventional hard combination (i.e., one bit scheme). Moreover, comparisons between proposed scheme, one bit and two bits schemes will be made.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873630/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12061725","publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873630/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Three bits softened decision scheme in cooperative spectrum sensing among cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three bits softened decision scheme in cooperative spectrum sensing among cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"C6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052638S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783416","isNumber":"5873575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783416","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5873575","articleId":"5873630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5873631,"authors":[{"name":"Hefdhallah Sakran","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, El-Mansoura University, Egypt"],"firstName":"Hefdhallah","lastName":"Sakran","id":"37658716800"},{"name":"Mona Shokair","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, El-Mansoura University, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mona","lastName":"Shokair","id":"37373546400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-804-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-805-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-803-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5873631","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","probability","radio networks","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STBC","Alamouti code scheme","cognitive radio networks","intelligent spectrum sharing technology","spectrum utilization","spectrum hole detection","multiple cognitive user local detection","AND rule","cooperative spectrum sensing","space time block code","probability of detection","false alarm probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","Alamouti code","cooperative spectrum sensing","energy detector"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5873631","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873631","publicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","abstract":"Cognitive radio is an intelligent spectrum sharing technology to improve the spectrum utilization.

If the statistics of the signal are not known, then adaptive filtering algorithms can be implemented to estimate the signals statistics iteratively. This paper aims to combine efficient filter structures with optimized code to create a system-on-chip (SOC) solution for various adaptive filtering problems specially unknown system identification. System identification is one of the most interesting applications for adaptive filters, especially for the Least Mean Square algorithm, due to its strength and calculus simplicity. Based on the error signal, the filter's coefficients are updated and becomes almost exactly as the unknown system' coefficients. Several different adaptive algorithms have been coded in VHDL as well as in MATLAB. The design is evaluated in terms of speed, hardware resources, and power consumption. System identification was mapped into a hardware description language, VHDL.

Efficient implementations of digital ultrasound systems on embedded digital signal processing on FPGA, this miniaturization enables a design with low power consumption, low noise, and light weight. This paper proposed embedded digital signal processing (DSP) for digital ultrasound imaging on FPGA (Xilinx, Inc.). The DSP was composed of FIR Hilbert transform filter, which was used to generate Quadrature component (Q) from the In-phase component (I) of the ultrasound data. The envelope (magnitude) of the received echo was computed. The implementation has been done in the Virtex-5 FPGA. The objective of this work is to build embedded DSP for ultrasound imaging system using the FIR Hilbert transform filter, which will be described in the methods. The system was consisted of: the pipeline adder block to reconstruct the focus ultrasound line, the bit modifier block to modify the bit of the signal to 16 bit, the FIR Hilbert filter block to obtain the quadrature components, the fractional delay filter (in-phase filter) to compensate the delay when we were used a high FIR order, and the envelope detection block to compute the envelope of the in-phase and quadrature components. The Hilbert filter is implemented in the form whereby the zero tap coefficients are not computed and therefore an order L filter uses only L/2 multiplications. This was reducing the computational time by a half. The simulation results of FIR Hilbert filter and the envelope detection are near to the ideal Hilbert. The results of the implementation are good compared to the simulation results. From the implementation result the total estimated power consumption equal to 0.8142W and the device utilization was acceptable. It is possible for the system to accept anther devices for further processing. The hardware architecture of the design provided flexibility.","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873642","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783416/5873575/05873642.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","publicationTitle":"2011 28th National Radio Science Conference (NRSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2011.5873642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded digital signal processing for digital ultrasound imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Embedded digital signal processing for digital ultrasound imaging","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12050518","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5873642/","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded digital signal processing for digital ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"K1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097611S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783416","isNumber":"5873575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783416","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5873575","articleId":"5873642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5873788,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Qi","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Qi","id":"38018579500"},{"name":"Zhi Deng","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Deng","id":"37287682000"},{"name":"Hui Gong","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Gong","id":"38019933600"},{"name":"Yinong Liu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598271000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9105-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9106-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9104-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5873788","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":487},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Real time systems","Clocks","Calibration","Field programmable gate arrays","Binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","clocks","delays","encoding","field programmable gate arrays","high energy physics instrumentation computing","logic design","nuclear electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resolution wave union","FPGA TDC","high level resolution","power supply voltage","on-chip calibration analysis","on-chip real time correction method","fast encoding logic method","dead time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TDC","FPGA","Wave Union","Real Time Correction","Fast Encoding"]}],"abstract":"Benefit from wave union, the bins (especially the ultra-wide bins) are sub-divided by each other, making FPGA TDC achieve a resolution beyond its cell delay.

By connecting both preamplifier and ADC, digital snap-shots of injected test-pulses have been recorded successfully, showing the proper oscilloscope-like operation of the whole mixed-signal data chain from analog amplification to digital output encoding.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5873992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5873992","startPage":"1358","endPage":"1362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05873992.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPADIC \u2014 A self-triggered pulse amplification and digitization ASIC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","displayDocTitle":"SPADIC \u2014 A self-triggered pulse amplification and digitization ASIC","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5873992/","accessionNumber":"12060746","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5873992/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPADIC \u2014 A self-triggered pulse amplification and digitization ASIC","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"287N47122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070629S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5873992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5874005,"authors":[{"name":"J Imrek","affiliation":["Institute for Nuclear Research, Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"J","lastName":"Imrek","id":"37295970000"},{"name":"Gy Hegyesi","affiliation":["Institute of Nuclear Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"Gy","lastName":"Hegyesi","id":"37295969000"},{"name":"G Kalinka","affiliation":["Institute of Nuclear Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"G","lastName":"Kalinka","id":"37295967600"},{"name":"J Molnar","affiliation":["Institute of Nuclear Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"J","lastName":"Molnar","id":"37289292200"},{"name":"F Nagy","affiliation":["Institute of Nuclear Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"F","lastName":"Nagy","id":"38028715000"},{"name":"I Valastyan","affiliation":["Institute of Nuclear Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (ATOMKI), Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"I","lastName":"Valastyan","id":"37295965300"},{"name":"Zs Szabo","affiliation":["Institute of Experimental Physics, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zs","lastName":"Szabo","id":"37284677400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9105-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9106-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9104-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5874005","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":372},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delay","Clocks","Protocols","Conferences","Calibration","Delay lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based TDC","Virtex-4 ISERDES blocks","split-phase arrangement","PVT variations","high channel counts","time-to-digital converters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TDC","interleaving","ISERDES","FPGA","Virtex-4"]}],"abstract":"We report on the implementation of an interleaving TDC architecture based on Virtex-4 ISERDES blocks.

In front-end electronics for PET, power-line fluctuation, dark current, noise disturbances, hum and pulse tail may cause baseline drift, which could lead to the inaccuracy in time, energy and position measurement. We propose a pulse-characterization based baseline calibration restoration algorithm (PCBRA) for digitally sampling scintillation pulses with multi-voltage threshold (MVT) method to correct baseline drift. In this method, a number of threshold-time pairs, digitally sampled from scintillation pulses with preset referenced voltages, are obtained to fit the waveform with a linear curve representing leading edge and an exponential curve representing falling edge, respectively. According to the mathematical model of the falling edge mentioned above, the baseline offset can be obtained and then be subtracted from the waveform to retrieve the pulse without baseline drift. Our preliminary results show that with the application of PCBRA, energy resolution can be obtained accurately, which is close to that obtained with regular-time sampling (RTS) method based baseline calibration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging

The LAr TPC will be used for long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The ASIC must provide low-noise readout of the signals induced on the TPC wires, digitization of those signals at 2 MS/s, compression, buffering and multiplexing. A resolution better than 1000 rms electrons at 200 pF input capacitance for an input range of 300 fC is required, along with low power and operation in LAr (at 87 K). We present the characterization of a commercial technology for operation in cryogenic environment and the first experimental results on the analog front-end. The results demonstrate that CMOS transistors have lower noise and much improved dc characteristics at LAr temperature. Finally, we introduce the concept of \u201c1/f equivalent\u201d to model the low-frequency component of the noise spectral density, for use in the input MOSFET optimization.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874057","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874057.pdf","startPage":"1658","endPage":"1666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Front-end ASIC for a liquid argon TPC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","displayDocTitle":"Front-end ASIC for a liquid argon TPC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874057/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12068128","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874057/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Front-end ASIC for a liquid argon TPC","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"352N56002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106379S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5874069,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Frach","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Frach","id":"37268166000"},{"name":"Gordian Prescher","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gordian","lastName":"Prescher","id":"37398301900"},{"name":"Carsten Degenhardt","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Degenhardt","id":"38227570100"},{"name":"Ben Zwaans","affiliation":["Philips Digital Photon Counting, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Zwaans","id":"38017202600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9105-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9106-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9104-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5874069","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":738},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874069","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonics","Measurement by laser beam","Crystals","Pixel","Laser beams","Photomultipliers","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche photodiodes","nuclear electronics","photomultipliers","photon counting","silicon radiation detectors","solid scintillation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital silicon photomultiplier","system architecture","performance evaluation","fully digital implementation","chip design","technology demonstrator chip","self-contained detector","JTAG controller","integrated acquisition controller","sensor","single photon avalanche photodiode","SPAD technology","standard CMOS process flow","dedicated cell electronics block","active quenching","recharge circuits","balanced trigger network","integrated time-to-digital converters","photon detection","photon counting","temperature variations","electronic noise","serial data interface"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874069","endPage":"1727","startPage":"1722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874069.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The digital silicon photomultiplier \u2014 System architecture and performance evaluation","abstract":"In this paper we present the first fully digital implementation of the Silicon Photomultiplier. The chip design is based on the technology demonstrator chip presented in. The new sensor represents a self-contained detector including a JTAG controller for configuration and test, single-ended and differential clock and test input signals, an integrated acquisition controller and two serial data outputs. The sensor is based on a single photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) technology integrated in a standard CMOS process flow. Photons are detected directly by sensing the voltage at the SPAD terminal using a dedicated cell electronics block next to each diode. This block also contains active quenching and recharge circuits as well as a one bit memory for the selective activation of individual detector cells. A balanced trigger network is used to propagate the trigger signal from all cells to the two integrated time-to-digital converters. Photons are detected and counted as digital signals, thus making the sensor less susceptible to temperature variations and electronic noise. The resulting data packets are transferred to the readout system through a serial data interface. In this paper, we discuss the new sensor architecture and evaluate its performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874069/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874069/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12060822","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The digital silicon photomultiplier \u2014 System architecture and performance evaluation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The digital silicon photomultiplier \u2014 System architecture and performance evaluation","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"364N58001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058516S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5874131,"authors":[{"name":"Ealgoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Department of Electrical Engineering and Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford (MIPS), University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ealgoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"38023422900"},{"name":"Peter Olcott","affiliation":["Department of Bio-engineering, Department of Radiology, Department of Electrical Engineering, Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford (MIPS), and Bio-X Program, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Olcott","id":"37268440900"},{"name":"Craig Levin","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, Department of Electrical Engineering, Department of Physics, and the Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford (MIPS), University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Levin","id":"37268412100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9105-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9106-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9104-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5874131","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data acquisition","Optical fibers","Throughput","Positron emission tomography","Field programmable gate arrays","Optical network units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","biomedical MRI","brain","data acquisition","optical cables","optical fibre networks","optical interconnections","optical transceivers","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical network-based PET DAQ system","one fiber optical connection","MRI compatible PET brain scanner","optical transceiver","daisy-chained structure","optical patch cables","optical connection","analog-to-digital converters","time-to-digital converters","parallel data buses","serial buses","control signals","clock signals","optical fiber channel","asymmetric coincidence processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Positron emission tomography (PET)","Data Acquisition System (DAQ)","synchronization","coincidence event processing"]}],"abstract":"We are developing a DAQ system for an MRI compatible PET brain scanner using an optical transceiver to interconnect boards in a daisy-chained structure.

acquisition of two spectrally distinct attenuation measurements. The two most common techniques are the dual-kV technique and the dual-detector layer technique. More recently, another technique was introduced based on the simultaneous acquisition of photon-counting and current integration data (CIX) by means of a dedicated detector readout ASIC. All of the above methods have certain advantages and disadvantages. While depending on the particular realization (e.g., kVp switching, dual-tube systems in computed tomography), the dual-kV technique suffers from a time-lag between the two acquisitions and as a result from susceptibility to motion. The dual-layer technique usually offers less spectral separation and requires a dedicated detection system. The CIX technique suffers from a reduced dynamic range due to the limiting rate performance in the counting channel. In this paper we introduce yet another dual-energy technique, similar to the CIX, however, without the restrictions coming from the limited count rate. We propose dual-energy imaging based on simultaneous acquisition of the mean (DC) and variance (AC) components of the electrical detector signal, i.e., simultaneous integration-mode readout and Campbell-mode readout (fluctuation mode). The method is based on \u201cCampbell's theorem\u201d which states that the variance of the deviations from the mean detector signal is proportional to the second moment of the incoming x-ray energy spectrum. We compare in simulations the dual-energy performance of the proposed new technique with conventional dual-kV and dual-crystal techniques and present first experimental Campbell-mode CT images obtained from a scintillator crystal coupled to a photomultiplier tube. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of separating iodine from calcium with the novel technique and compare it to the separability achieved with a dual-kV technique.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874151.pdf","startPage":"2112","endPage":"2115","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-energy x-ray imaging by simultaneous integration and campbelling readout","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dual-energy x-ray imaging by simultaneous integration and campbelling readout","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5874151/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12060903","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874151/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-energy x-ray imaging by simultaneous integration and campbelling readout","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"446M07005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046893S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5874155,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is used in practice, e.g., for target imaging in image-guided radiotherapy or for localization and attenuation correction in SPECT/CT imaging. The X-ray projections, acquired on a circular source trajectory, each cover roughly half the CT FoV; a central overlap region is imaged by all projections. Offset-detector CBCT reconstruction requires special algorithms. For large detector offsets, previously proposed filtered-backprojection methods can lead to shading artifacts, specifically left/right intensity imbalance. Here, we propose using iterative reconstruction for offset-detector CBCT. To handle the special acquisition geometry, known iterative reconstruction algorithms are modified in terms of axial truncation compensation, redundancy weighting, and algorithm initialization. An efficient implementation using a graphics processing unit (GPU) delivers clinically feasible reconstruction times. Results from patient and phantom studies are presented, showing a clear reduction of artifacts and improvement in image quality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative reconstruction for circular cone-beam CT with an offset flat-panel detector","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874179","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874179.pdf","startPage":"2228","endPage":"2231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874179/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative reconstruction for circular cone-beam CT with an offset flat-panel detector","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874179/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12060931","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative reconstruction for circular cone-beam CT with an offset flat-panel detector","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"474M09231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081741S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5874184,"authors":[{"name":"Margaret E.

Reconstruction approaches in TOF-PET systems include list-mode and binned iterative algorithms as well as confidence-weighted analytic methods. List-mode iterative TOF reconstruction retains the full accuracy of the data in the spatial and temporal domains but is computationally intensive. We have developed an approach [DIRECT (direct image reconstruction for TOF)] to speed up TOF reconstruction that takes advantage of the reduced angular sampling requirement of TOF data by grouping list-mode data into a small number of azimuthal views and co-polar tilts and depositing the grouped events into histo-images, arrays with the sampling and geometry of the final image. All physical effects are included in the system model and deposited in the same histo-image structure. Using histo-images allows efficient computation during reconstruction without ray-tracing or interpolation operations. The DIRECT approach was compared with the 3D list-mode TOF ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction for phantom and patient data taken on the UPenn prototype LaBr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n TOF-PET scanner. The total reconstruction time with DIRECT for data with 430-ps timing resolution was 1/3 that of list-mode TOF-OSEM to achieve comparable image quality. While the reconstruction time for list-mode TOF-OSEM depends on the number of events and sizes of the spatial and TOF kernels, the time for DIRECT is independent of these factors. The DIRECT approach is able to reproduce the image quality of the list-mode iterative TOF reconstruction both qualitatively and quantitatively in measured data with a significantly reduced time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5874184/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12060936","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of list-mode and DIRECT approaches for time-of-flight PET reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of list-mode and DIRECT approaches for time-of-flight PET reconstruction","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"479M09256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069072S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5874190,"authors":[{"name":"Yusheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yusheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37405710600"},{"name":"Michael Rozler","affiliation":["Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Rozler","id":"37320554000"},{"name":"Wei Chang","affiliation":["Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chang","id":"37273918900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9105-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9106-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9104-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5874190","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image resolution","Image quality","Kernel","Noise","Phantoms","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiology","expectation-maximisation algorithm","Gaussian processes","image sampling","iterative methods","medical image processing","noise","optical transfer function","phantoms","single photon emission computed tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["view sampling requirements","dedicated cardiac SPECT systems","detection efficiency","angular sampling","image quality","iterative reconstruction","sinograms","digital heart phantom","depth-dependent Gaussian PSF","inverse fanbeam geometry","FBP","OSEM","normalized root mean squared error","NRMSE","recovery coefficient","noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["View sampling","iterative image reconstruction","PSF modeling","FBP","image quality","cardiac SPECT"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874190","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874190.pdf","startPage":"2282","endPage":"2287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"View sampling requirements for cardiac SPECT","abstract":"The new generation of dedicated cardiac SPECT systems achieve high detection efficiency by focusing onto a small field of view (FOV) that encloses a patient's heart. They also generally use a relatively small number of views for angular sampling. The objective of this study is to use simulations to investigate the relationship between number of views and image quality when iterative reconstruction is used for cardiac SPECT. In our simulations, sinograms, with number of views from 6 to 60 evenly spaced over an appropriate angular range, were generated from a digital heart phantom. A depth-dependent Gaussian PSF was modeled for a SPECT system with an inverse-fanbeam geometry. We varied the system resolution at the center of the FOV from 9 mm to 18 mm FWHM in 3 mm steps. We performed reconstructions using conventional FBP, and OS-EM with and without PSF modeling. We compared the reconstructed images with different number of views and different system resolutions qualitatively and quantitatively. Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and recovery coefficient (RC) were calculated as indices of image quality. Noise performance was also analyzed as a function of number of iteration. Our results indicate that, NRMSE decreases and RC increases initially as the number of views increases then flatten out around 18-24 views. For a 9-15 mm system resolution, 15-24 views are optimal for a 16 cm FOV since further increase of the number of views only improves image quality marginally. Similar to FBP, OS-EM shows the same trend that the number of views required is inversely proportional to the system resolution. Under the same system resolution and number of views, OS-EM achieves better image quality than FBP does, especially when PSF is modeled in the reconstruction. The simulations demonstrate that modern cardiac SPECT using iterative reconstruction with PSF modeling allows the use of reduced number of views compared to conventional SPECT using FBP.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5874190/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12060942","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"View sampling requirements for cardiac SPECT","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"View sampling requirements for cardiac SPECT","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"485M09296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08405S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5874196,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In conventional PET, coincidence identification is usually carried out through a coincidence electronic unit, so that randoms occur when two photons arising from two annihilation events are detected within the same coincidence time window. To compensate for randoms, the number of random events contributing to each line-of-response (LOR) should be estimated. On the other hand, some novel systems allow coincidences to be selected post-acquisition in software, or in real time through a digital coincidence engine in a FPGA. These approaches provide the user maximum flexibility in the post-processing of acquired data, thus allowing alternative coincidence sorting procedures to be applied. In this work a natural application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods to the problem of reducing random coincidences has been investigated. It has been compared against a conventional coincidence sorting algorithm based on a time coincidence window combined with geometrical conditions. At matched efficiencies, the ANN based method presents always a sorted output with a smaller random fraction. In addition, two differential trends are found: the conventional method presents a maximum achievable efficiency while the ANN-based one is able to increase the efficiency up to unity, the ideal value, but at the cost of increasing the random fraction. Pattern recognition capabilities of ANN could be more adequate for more complex situations, where simple techniques such as the conventional sorter fails to model the underlying physics.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874196","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874196.pdf","startPage":"2308","endPage":"2313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of random coincidences in small animal PET using Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of random coincidences in small animal PET using Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12060948","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5874196/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of random coincidences in small animal PET using Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"491M09331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071629S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5874272,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For the B-ICD method, however, this paper forms and solves a linear system corresponding to a block of voxels in which the correlation is directly accounted for. Using this framework, highly correlated voxels is updated whereas with GCD algorithms it is preferable in terms of the resultant relaxation factors to update voxels with little to no correlation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Acceleration","Correlation","Symmetric matrices","Cost function","Image reconstruction","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","correlation methods","image reconstruction","iterative methods","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block-based iterative coordinate descent","X-ray computed tomography","reconstruction algorithm","image updates","coordinate descent","underrelaxation factor","correlation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874316.pdf","startPage":"2856","endPage":"2859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-based iterative coordinate descent","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block-based iterative coordinate descent","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874316/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874316/","accessionNumber":"12061065","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-based iterative coordinate descent","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"611M14238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052257S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5874319,"authors":[{"name":"Sungsoo Ha","affiliation":["Center of Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sungsoo","lastName":"Ha","id":"38021621900"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Zhang","affiliation":["Center of Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38025124400"},{"name":"Klaus Mueller","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Mueller","id":"37273119700"},{"name":"Samuel Matej","affiliation":["Center of Visual Computing, Computer Science Department, Stony Brook University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Matej","id":"37268307100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9105-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9106-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9104-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5874319","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Image reconstruction","Graphics processing unit","Acceleration","Strontium","Positron emission tomography","Filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","iterative methods","medical image processing","positron emission tomography","predictor-corrector methods","time of flight spectra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel decomposition scheme","3D time-of-flight PET reconstruction","DIRECT approach","iterative predictor-corrector operations","image space","computational bottleneck","convolution operation","spatially variant resolution kernels","Fourier domain","memory cache performance","nonaxis aligned directions","axis-aligned orientation","convolution operations","high speed-performance","orientation angles","cascaded kernels","GPU-accelerating long kernel convolutions","convolution kernels"]}],"abstract":"The DIRECT approach for 3-D Time-of-Flight (TOF) PET reconstruction performs all iterative predictor-corrector operations directly in image space. A computational bottleneck here is the convolution with the long TOF (resolution) kernels. Accelerating this convolution operation using GPUs is very important especially for spatially variant resolution kernels, which cannot be efficiently implemented in the Fourier domain. The main challenge here is the memory cache performance at non-axis aligned directions. We devised a scheme that first re-samples the image into an axis-aligned orientation offering good memory coherence for the convolution operations. In order to maintain good accuracy, we carefully design the resampling and new convolution kernels to combine into the original TOF kernel.

Due to the redundancy of TOF information, data can be compressed almost without loss of resolution. Such compression may consist of azimuthal mashing by a hardware rebinner. In addition to this, some azimuthal and radial information might not be acquired at all due to scanner design. Gaps that exist between the detector blocks are one example of this. TOF iterative and some TOF analytical reconstruction can handle significantly azimuthally undersampled data. Nevertheless, widely used analytical non-TOF reconstruction algorithms, such as FORE+FBP, need fine azimuthal sampling of projection data, as well as TOF FORE. We propose to restore fine azimuthal sampling of measured data for scanner performance assessments exploiting TOF consistency conditions. A practical application is a preprocessing of data for standard scanner characteristics assessment. Point source resolution estimation by analytical non-TOF methods is considered in this paper.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Interpolation","Mashups","Image restoration","Trajectory","Filling","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","data compression","image reconstruction","iterative methods","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine azimuthal sampling","projection data","data compression","TOF analytical reconstruction","TOF iterative reconstrution","FORE+FBP","point source resolution estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874366.pdf","startPage":"3079","endPage":"3084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restoration of fine azimuthal sampling of measured TOF projection data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Restoration of fine azimuthal sampling of measured TOF projection data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874366/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874366/","accessionNumber":"12061112","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restoration of fine azimuthal sampling of measured TOF projection data","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"661M17004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073904S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5874367,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Michaud","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, Sherbrooke, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Michaud","id":"37268343800"},{"name":"Charles-Antoine Brunet","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, Canada"],"firstName":"Charles-Antoine","lastName":"Brunet","id":"37354470700"},{"name":"Roger Lecomte","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear Medicine and Radiobiology, Sherbrooke Molecular ImagingCenter, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, Canada"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Lecomte","id":"37276643100"},{"name":"R\u00e9jean Fontaine","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrook, Canada"],"firstName":"R\u00e9jean","lastName":"Fontaine","id":"37276636700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9105-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9106-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9104-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5874367","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874367","abstract":"High-resolution PET scanners with pixelated detectors have great sensitivity increase potential through the inclusion of multiple coincidences. Indeed, poor energy resolution and in-crystal detection mispositioning often prevent \u201ctraditional\u201d Compton kinematics analysis from yielding high Line-of-Response (LOR) discrimination rates, while Bayesian methods are computationally expensive. Hence multiple coincidences are usually discarded when image degradation is not acceptable. This paper presents results from a new method to include Inter-Crystal Scatter (ICS) triple coincidences in the image without significant image degradation. The triple coincidences analyzed are the simplest inter-crystal Compton scatter scenario. Instead of mathematical models, the method employs geometry simplification of the raw energy and position measurements, which are then fed to a neural network. The paper quickly visits the algorithm structure, presents some Monte-Carlo validation results of the method with the LabPET model and shows images reconstructed from real data. The method achieves a 42% increase in sensitivity at the expense of a 10% degradation in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), with numerous potential improvements.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874367","startPage":"3085","endPage":"3087","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874367.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Results from neural networks for recovery of PET triple coincidences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Sensitivity","Positron emission tomography","Image reconstruction","Photonics","Monte Carlo methods","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","medical image processing","neural nets","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","PET triple coincidences","inter-crystal scatter triple","image degradation","inter-crystal Compton scatter scenario","Monte-Carlo validation","LabPET model","image reconstruction","contrast-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Positron Emission Tomography (PET)","Multiple Coincidences","Sensitivity","Neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","displayDocTitle":"Results from neural networks for recovery of PET triple coincidences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874367/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"12061113","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Results from neural networks for recovery of PET triple coincidences","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"662M17006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038095S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5874372,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This combined with FPGA's low expense, ease of use, and selected dedicated hardware make them an ideal technology for a data acquisition system for a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner. The University of Washington is producing a high-resolution, small-animal PET scanner that utilizes FPGAs as the core of the front-end electronics. For this next generation scanner, functions that are typically performed in dedicated circuits, or offline, are being migrated to the FPGA. This will not only simplify the electronics, but the features of modern FPGAs can be utilizes to add significant signal processing power to produce higher resolution images. In this paper we report on an all-digital pulse pileup correction algorithm that is being developed for the FPGA. The pileup mitigation algorithm will allow the scanner to run at higher count rates without incurring large data losses due to the overlapping of scintillation signals. This correction technique utilizes a reference pulse to extract timing and energy information for most pileup events. Using pulses were acquired from a Zecotech Photonics MAPDN with an LFS-3 scintillator, we show that good timing and energy information can be achieved in the presence of pileup.","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874372.pdf","startPage":"3105","endPage":"3112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based pulse pileup correction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874372/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based pulse pileup correction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12061118","pubMedId":"22228083","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874372/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based pulse pileup correction","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"667M18029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096361S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5874427,"authors":[{"name":"Garry Chinn","affiliation":["Department of Radiology and Molecular Imaging Program, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Garry","lastName":"Chinn","id":"37295883200"},{"name":"Peter D.

First, we develop a new theoretical framework for investigating multiplexing schemes for PET detectors using the theory of \"compressed sensing\" (CS). Second, we develop a new CS decoder that improves the multiplexing SNR. Because the photon events in PET are discrete, the detected photon signals are very sparse. CS theory can be used to specify multiplexing topologies that minimize the number of unique readout channels. In the case of readout for a PET detector array, CS can determine detector sampling criteria for effective \"decoding\" of the individual detector pixel signals and guide the design of multiplexing topologies for PET detector readouts. However, conventional CS methods do not account for the underlying noise model. Therefore, we develop a new method for decoding multiplexed detector signals that optimizes the SNR of the decoded detector pixel signals using maximum likelihood estimation, which we refer to as \"maximum likelihood CS\" (ML-CS) decoding. Using these results, we can describe any multiplexing readout scheme using a unified mathematical framework and formulate the optimal SNR estimator for recovering all detector signal information necessary to determine event interaction location, arrival time and energy with high precision. This ML-CS decoder can be applied to any multiplexing scheme such as standard Anger logic decoding. In this study, we study several different electronic multiplexing schemes for a given photodetector array design and use simulation studies to evaluate this new method. For example, for a conventional electronic multiplexing configuration known as \"cross-strip multiplexing\", we show that the ML-CS decoding algorithm can improve the SNR by 20-55% over conventional cross-strip readout decoding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving SNR with a maximum likelihood compressed sensing decoder for multiplexed PET detectors","publicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874427","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Nuclear Science Symposuim & Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5779755/5873695/05874427.pdf","startPage":"3353","endPage":"3356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.2010.5874427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improving SNR with a maximum likelihood compressed sensing decoder for multiplexed PET detectors","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-6 Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874427/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"12061171","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving SNR with a maximum likelihood compressed sensing decoder for multiplexed PET detectors","confLoc":"Knoxville, TN, USA","sourcePdf":"722M19030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067461S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2010-Nov. 6 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5779755","isNumber":"5873695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5779755","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5873695","articleId":"5874427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5874488,"authors":[{"name":"Kamil Grabowski","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Technical University of Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Kamil","lastName":"Grabowski","id":"37298132000"},{"name":"Andrzej Napieralski","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Technical University of Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Napieralski","id":"37284975000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9105-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9106-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9104-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3654"},{"format":"CD","value":"1082-3654"}],"articleNumber":"5874488","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1219},"abstract":"The computation speed offered by nowadays embedded systems allows combining advanced signal processing and data acquisition in dedicated architectures optimized for given applications. Such architectures can be used for 2D/3D signal analysis and reconstruction in such broad areas as: medical signal processing - tomography object reconstruction (USG, PET, CT, OCT, etc.), biomedical image analysis - automated object segmentation and diagnostic support, biometry - pattern recognition, etc. The technological advances in the scale of integration of integrated circuits as well as image acquisition and processing systems have played a major part in this trend. In particular, for medical image analysis common problems are content segmentation, analysis of selected objects, pattern estimation and storage. In the paper general architecture for advanced image processing is presented which can be adapted to specific needs, depending on intended use. This article describes a system for analysis of biometric data developed as part of the work conducted by the authors on the complete biometric identification system. Thus, the article focuses mostly on the biometrical iris identification system (1:N), chosen as an example well suited to the validation of the developed system. Several issues concerning efficient data processing using Field Programmable Arrays and Digital Signal Processors are presented on the basis of the described architecture. Algorithms computed on a desktop computer were adapted to this specialized, hardware-oriented architecture composed of Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA).

To achieve equal load sharing (in per unit) among sources, droop based controllers are used. However, equal sharing of load is achieved in ideal system. This paper investigates the deviation in load currents from their ideal values. Steady state mathematical model of the system is developed. This model is applicable to any interconnecting structure of sources and loads. Deviation of source currents from their ideal values is expressed in terms of load distribution pattern and differences in nominal voltages. Sensitivity of source currents to load currents and nominal voltages is derived. Effects of branch resistances and droop constants on the sensitivity of source currents are examined. Results obtained by analysis are verified by detailed simulation study. Viability of the model is confirmed by experimental results from a scaled-down laboratory prototype of dc microgrid.","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874577","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783415/5874563/05874577.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5874563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steady state performance analysis for load sharing in DC distributed generation system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Steady state performance analysis for load sharing in DC distributed generation system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12050425","htmlLink":"/document/5874577/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steady state performance analysis for load sharing in DC distributed generation system","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"paper113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063351S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783415","isNumber":"5874563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783415","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5874563","articleId":"5874577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5874597,"authors":[{"name":"Erkan Dursun","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Education, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erkan","lastName":"Dursun","id":"38015677000"},{"name":"Osman Kilic","affiliation":["Faculty of Technical Education, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Osman","lastName":"Kilic","id":"37088375647"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8782-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8779-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8781-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5874597","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874597","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Fuel cells","Mathematical model","Hydrogen","Fuels","Atmospheric modeling","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrochemical electrodes","membranes","neural nets","power engineering computing","proton exchange membrane fuel cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Levenberg-Marquardt neural network model","proton exchange membrane fuel cell","PEMFC","membrane electrode assembly","MEA","fuel cell electrical performance models","artificial neural network","electrochemical reactions","MATLAB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PEMFC","membrane electrode assembly","artificial neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874597","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783415/5874563/05874597.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5874563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Levenberg-Marquardt Neural Network model of the PEMFC's MEA","abstract":"Fuel cells are electrochemically complex, nonlinear, and dynamic energy conversion systems.

In this situation it is necessary to coordinate these two types of relays simultaneously that makes the problem harder to find a global optimal point. To overcome the complexity, it is a good idea to use an optimization algorithm like (GA) to perform coordination between distance and overcurrent relays. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on GA and linear programming (LP) is proposed to obtain the relay settings which are Time Multiplier Setting (TMS) and I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">set</sub>\n for overcurrent relays and Second Zone Time (T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">z2</sub>\n) for distance relays. By this assumption, new variables are added to the problem and size of search space will become bigger, thus finding the global optimal point will be harder. It is shown that the proposed hybrid GA can find a better solution in comparing to the conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874690","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783415/5874563/05874690.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5874563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal coordination of overcurrent and distance relays with hybrid genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protective relaying","Genetic algorithms","Linear programming","Biological cells","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","linear programming","overcurrent protection","power transmission protection","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal coordination","distance relays","hybrid genetic algorithm","overcurrent relays","backup relays","power transmission protection scheme","global optimal point","optimization algorithm","linear programming","relay settings","time multiplier setting","second zone time","search space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Overcurrent and distance relay coordination","Power system protection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal coordination of overcurrent and distance relays with hybrid genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874690/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12061505","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal coordination of overcurrent and distance relays with hybrid genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"paper263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052062S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783415","isNumber":"5874563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783415","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5874563","articleId":"5874690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5874698,"authors":[{"name":"Tahar Boukra","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Skikda University, Algeria"],"firstName":"Tahar","lastName":"Boukra","id":"38018344000"},{"name":"Abdesselam Lebaroud","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Skikda University, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdesselam","lastName":"Lebaroud","id":"37689516700"},{"name":"Guy Clerc","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France","UMR5005, Laboratoire AMPERE, CNRS, Villeurbanne, France","Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Clerc","id":"37271970600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8782-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8779-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8781-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5874698","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874698","abstract":"This paper presents a new diagnosis method for classifying current waveform events that are related to a variety of induction machine faults. The method is composed of two sequential processes: feature extraction and classification. The essence of the feature extraction is to project a faulty machine signal onto a low dimension time-frequency representation (TFR), which is deliberately designed for maximizing the separability between classes. A distinct TFR is designed for each class. The performance of fault classification is presented using two types of classifiers namely the Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) and the classical Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Levenberg Marquardt algorithm. The flexibility of this method allows an accurate classification independently from the level of load. This method has been validated on a 5.5-kW induction motor test bench.","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874698","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference

In the proposed method, medium voltage feeders' cross-sectional areas are calculated regarding not only economic factors and power loss costs, but also constraints such as current carrying capacity of feeder and maximum permissible voltage drop. Since particle swarm algorithm is used as the optimization tool, with high possibility, obtained solution would be near the absolute optimum point. This method was implemented in MATLAB7 environment.

The accuracy of the performance has been validated with the results of the IEEE-118 standard network.","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874768","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5874563","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783415/5874563/05874768.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Jacobian matrices","Instruction sets","Synchronization","Algorithm design and analysis","Kernel","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","load flow","parallel processing","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Jacobi power flow algorithm","SIMD-processor","single instruction multiple data unit processor","CPU","Newton-Raphson algorithm","IEEE-118 standard network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Massive Jacobi power flow based on SIMD-processor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874768/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874768/","accessionNumber":"12061578","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive Jacobi power flow based on SIMD-processor","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"paper377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04879S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783415","isNumber":"5874563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783415","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5874563","articleId":"5874768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":5874776,"authors":[{"name":"Nnamdi I.

A major offshoot of this search for energy efficient solutions is demand management in power systems. The goal of any demand management program is to control the demand for electric power among customers thereby creating load relief for electric utilities and improving system security. Typically demand management contract formulations reward customers who willingly sign up for load interruption with incentives. These forms of contracts are termed incentive compatible contracts and the incentive offered the customer should exceed interruption cost and at the same time should be beneficial to the utility. There are different systems to design these kind of contracts and in the past mechanism design from Game theory, has been used in the design of such contracts. In this work we propose an artificial neural network which is trained to determine the optimal contract. The learning algorithm utilized by the artificial neural network is the back propagation learning algorithm where useful power system parameters serve as the neural networks input while the neural systems output is the contract value. Game theory's mechanism design serves as the target for results obtained from the artificial neural network. Our proposed neural system is tested on the IEEE 14 bus test system.","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874776","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5874563","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783415/5874563/05874776.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network model for optimal demand management contract design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874776/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network model for optimal demand management contract design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874776/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12061586","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network model for optimal demand management contract design","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"paper389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059267S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783415","isNumber":"5874563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783415","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5874563","articleId":"5874776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5874795,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The desired modes in small signal stability are electromechanical modes, so in this paper the recognition of electromechanical modes have been done using sensitivity analysis of eigenvalues of system with respect to machine inertia. For finding the optimal setting of PSS and TCSC parameters, with use of genetic algorithm an objective function based on damping ratio has been considered in this paper. In order to find the optimal placement of PSS, the Participation Factor (PF) technique will be used, in this technique the proper generator for installing the PSS in its excitation system will be that has most contribution to minimum damping ratio of electromechanical modes.

On the basis of recent developments in impedance source (Z-source) inverters the present paper proposes an integration of quasi-Z-source inverter (qZSI) with a built-in high frequency transformer. Two new type LCCT-Z-Source inverters are presented by author. Proposed inverters characterize continuous input current, improved relationship between boost coefficient and modulation index and improved EMI performance. Application of four element (Inductor - Capacitor - Capacitor - Transformer) LCCT impedance network provides higher voltage gain than obtained in quasi-Z-source inverter. The advantage of proposed topology over other recently developed trans Z-source inverters (TZSI) is that two built-in capacitors block DC currents in transformer windings and prevents core saturation. Simulation and experimental results are shown to verify the proposed topologies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783415/5874563/05874799.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEIC.2011.5874799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5874563","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LCCT-Z-Source inverters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Capacitors","Inductors","Topology","Impedance","Modulation","Windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-AC power convertors","electromagnetic interference","invertors","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LCCT-Z-source inverters","renewable generation units","DC-AC converters","step-up power conversion","impedance source inverters","quasi-Z-source inverter","qZSI","built-in high frequency transformer","EMI performance","LCCT impedance network","TZSI","built-in capacitors","transformer windings","DC currents"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quasi Z-source inverter","renewable sources","buck-boost inverter","single stage energy processing","integrated passives"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"LCCT-Z-Source inverters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5874799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12061609","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LCCT-Z-Source inverters","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"paper424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057157S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783415","isNumber":"5874563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783415","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5874563","articleId":"5874799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5874832,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Jafari","affiliation":["University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Jafari","id":"38255830900"},{"name":"Hasan Monsef","affiliation":["University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Monsef","id":"37320353900"},{"name":"Saeed Zolfaghari Moghadam","affiliation":["Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed Zolfaghari","lastName":"Moghadam","id":"38253434000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8782-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8779-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8781-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5874832","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5874832","abstract":"One of the remarkable phenomena in power systems is the appearance of Distributed Generation (DGs).

In the recent past Power System Stabilizer (PSS) was used to damp LFO. FACTs devices, such as Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC), can control power flow, reduce sub-synchronous resonance and increase transient stability. So UPFC may be used to damp LFO instead of PSS. UPFC damps LFO through direct control of voltage and power. In this research the linearized model of synchronous machine (Heffron-Philips) connected to infinite bus (Single Machine-Infinite Bus: SMIB) with UPFC is used and also in order to damp LFO, adaptive neuro-fuzzy controller for UPFC is designed and simulated. Simulation is performed for various types of loads and for different disturbances.

Typically, the analysis of self-similar series is performed using: the variance-time plot, the R/S plot, the periodogram, and Whittle's estimator. The first three are graphical methods, and their accuracy depends strongly on the interpretation of the plot. Whittle's estimator is based on a maximum likelihood technique and offers excellent results; however it is computationally pricey.

This paper enlists the generally dealt objectives and constraints for the three control applications. The presence of distributed generators in smart grids brings in factors that need additional consideration in solving the multi-objective optimization.

Black hole attacks are effective DoS (Denial of Service) attacks committed by fabricating routing information, attracting packets routed through them, and then dropping the packets. The ETX (Expected Transmission Count) metric is a common routing metric in MANETs. It measures the delivery ratio of a wireless link to find the high throughput routes. However, the acquisition of a ETX metric value is subject to abuse. This paper describes a solution to counter black hole attacks on the ETX metric acquisition process. The solution is called the Secure ETX (SETX) protocol. The protocol, instead of allowing individual nodes to advertise their respective delivery ratios (as in ETX) at will, allows nodes to measure neighbours' delivery ratios directly. Simulation results have shown that this novel protocol can provide a marked improvement in network performances in the presence of black hole attacks, and it can do so with a negligible level of additional overhead.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5874867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSC.2011.5874910","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/5781738/5874867/05874910.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"513","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2011.5874910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A countermeasure to black hole attacks in mobile ad hoc networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"A countermeasure to black hole attacks in mobile ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5874910/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12049728","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5874910/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A countermeasure to black hole attacks in mobile ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"0073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056476S","chronDate":"11-13 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5781738","isNumber":"5874867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5781738","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5874867","articleId":"5874910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 SinfraS - Society for Infrastructure Systems","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":5874926,"authors":[{"name":"Pangun Park","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Pangun","lastName":"Park","id":"37530172400"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Ara\u00fajo","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Ara\u00fajo","id":"37590835500"},{"name":"Karl Henrik Johansson","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Karl Henrik","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37270842500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9573-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9570-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9572-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5874926","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":928},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Wireless networks","Protocols","Wireless sensor networks","Control systems","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","optimal control","optimisation","probability","protocols","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless networked control system co-design","sensor measurement","IEEE 802.15.4 protocol","packet loss probability","optimal control technique","optimal traffic load","constrained optimization problem","energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Co-design","Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller","Medium Access Control","IEEE 802.15.4","Optimization"]}],"abstract":"A framework for the joint design of wireless network and controllers is proposed. Multiple control systems are considered where the sensor measurements are transmitted to the controller over the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol.

We first present an analytical model of the packet loss probability and delay of a IEEE 802.15.4 network. Through optimal control techniques we derive the control cost as a function of the packet loss probability and delay. Simulation results show the feasible control performance. It is shown that the optimal traffic load is similar when the communication throughput or control cost are optimized. The co-design approach is based on a constrained optimization problem, for which the objective function is the energy consumption of the network and the constraints are the packet loss probability and delay, which are derived from the desired control cost.

Deploying multiple MUAVs which stably carry sensing equipment in hostile environments yields cost efficiency and reducing the risk to human life. The use of an aerial ad hoc sensor network based on MUAV agents promises more timely and accurate information by fusing measurements from different types of sensors. In this paper, we examine agent-based mobility algorithms that target high spatial coverage distribution, high total coverage, and high-quality communication links. For these key figures, the performance of the different novel mobility algorithms is evaluated. We particularly focus on channel aware mobility and on self-organizing mesh topologies of MUAV-based sensor swarms with respect to communication constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5875861/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12300735","volume":"11","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Agent Mobility for Aerial Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Agent Mobility for Aerial Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-daniel-2159489-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079154S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6046174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6046174","articleId":"5875861","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5875865,"authors":[{"name":"Jaejin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and MINT Center, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Jaejin","lastName":"Lee","id":"38240275800"},{"name":"Yang-Ki Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and MINT Center, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Yang-Ki","lastName":"Hong","id":"38183458400"},{"name":"Seok Bae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and MINT Center, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Seok","lastName":"Bae","id":"37402862100"},{"name":"Gavin S.

The first one is a time-domain equation equivalent to the surface impedance contained in the Cooray-Rubinstein formula, while the second one is an improved equation that provides more accurate results in the vicinity of lightning. The induced voltages are calculated for a strike in the vicinity of the line (50 m) and the results show that, for good-conducting earth, the two formulations are equivalent. However, for poor-conducting earth, the second expression provides a higher and longer induced voltage. Based on the calculation results, a limiting condition for the use of these equations is proposed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5986812/05875878.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2011.2155661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2011.2155661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986812","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5875878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of the Surface Impedance on the Induced Voltages in Overhead Lines From Nearby Lightning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earth","Surface impedance","Impedance","Equations","Lightning","Mathematical model","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earthing","lightning protection","power overhead lines","surface impedance","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface impedance","overhead lines","lightning-induced voltages","horizontal electric field","time-domain equation equivalent","Cooray-Rubinstein formula"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Induced voltage","lightning","soil conductivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Effect of the Surface Impedance on the Induced Voltages in Overhead Lines From Nearby Lightning","volume":"53","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5875878/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12190103","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of the Surface Impedance on the Induced Voltages in Overhead Lines From Nearby Lightning","sourcePdf":"temc-barbosa-2155661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091385S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5986812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5986812","articleId":"5875878","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5875882,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo A.

Among the existing multilevel converter topologies, the modular multilevel converter (MMC) provides the advantages of high modularity, availability, and high power quality. Moreover, the main advantage compared to cascaded multilevel converters is the lack of an input transformer which results in a reduction of cooling requirements, size, and cost. One of the drawbacks of this topology when used as an ac-ac converter is the input and output frequency components in the control loop, resulting in a more complex controller design. In this paper, a single-phase ac-ac MMC predictive control approach is proposed. The controller minimizes the input, output, and circulating current errors and balances the dc voltages. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed predictive control scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6151927/05875882.pdf","startPage":"2832","endPage":"2839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2159349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2159349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151927","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5875882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Control of AC\u2013AC Modular Multilevel Converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Predictive control","Switches","Integrated circuits","Prediction algorithms","Topology","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC power convertors","control system synthesis","cooling","frequency control","power supply quality","power transformers","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC modular multilevel converter topology","medium-voltage operation","high power application","high power quality","cascaded multilevel converter","input transformer","cooling requirement reduction","frequency component","control loop","complex controller design","single-phase AC-AC MMC predictive control","current error","DC voltage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modular multilevel converter (MMC)","power electronics","predictive control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Control of AC\u2013AC Modular Multilevel Converters","volume":"59","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5875882/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12537473","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Control of AC\u2013AC Modular Multilevel Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-perez-2159349-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06154S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6151927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"6151927","articleId":"5875882","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5875883,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Uday Prabhu","affiliation":["Departamento de Ciencia de Computadores, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Vinay Uday","lastName":"Prabhu","id":"37575710800"},{"name":"Miguel.

The constant search for new coil features and improved performance has highlighted the need of employing more versatile optimization techniques capable of dealing with the new requirements. In this paper, the solution of linear and nonlinear optimization problems using particle-swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms is presented. Examples of coil designed using this heuristic method are shown, including a comparison to solutions provided by conventional optimization approaches. Numerical experiments reveal that the application of PSO for the solution of inverse boundary element problems for coil design is a computationally efficient algorithm that is capable of handling nonlinear problems and that offers fast convergence, especially for those symmetric coil geometries where the computational effort can be drastically reduced by using suitable dimensionality-reduction techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2159510","startPage":"4761","endPage":"4768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2159510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6084874","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6084874/05875885.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Gradient Coil for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applying Particle-Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875885/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of Gradient Coil for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applying Particle-Swarm Optimization","volume":"47","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5875885/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12376431","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Gradient Coil for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applying Particle-Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tmag-cobossanchez-2159510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083791S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6084874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6084874","articleId":"5875885","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5875887,"authors":[{"name":"Xueming Ju","affiliation":["Institute for Nanoelectronics, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6122889/5875887/5875887-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xueming Ju was born in Gaocheng, China.

Spin transfer torque (STT)-based switching has advantages in device scaling compared to the field-switching mechanism. However, the previously proposed MTJ logic devices have operated independently and, therefore, are limited to only basic logic operations. Consequently, the MTJ device has only been used as an ancillary device, rather than the main computation device. As a result, the full benefits of MTJ-based computation have not been explored. New designs are needed to accelerate the development of the MTJ-based logic devices. Specifically the realization of direct communication between the MTJ devices is crucial to fully utilize the MTJ devices in the circuits to implement more advanced logic functions. In this paper, new MTJ-based spintronic logic units (building blocks) for spintronic circuits using the STT switching mechanism have been proposed and investigated, which includes the designs of a basic STT-MTJ logic cell, a direct communication between the MTJ logic cells, a three-MTJ logic unit and a spintronic logic circuit acting as an arithmetic logic unit.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2011.2158848","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","startPage":"120","endPage":"126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6122889/05875889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2011.2158848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6122889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic Tunnel Junction-Based Spintronic Logic Units Operated by Spin Transfer Torque","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Magnetoelectronics","Switches","Materials","Electrodes","Torque","Logic functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic circuits","magnetic tunnelling","magnetoelectronics","programmable logic devices","switching","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic tunnel junction device","spintronic logic unit","spin transfer torque","programmable logic device","nonvolatile computation device","Spin transfer torque","switching","field-switching mechanism","ancillary device","arithmetic logic unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic tunnel junction","nonvolatile logic","spin transfer torque (STT)","spintronic logic device"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Magnetic Tunnel Junction-Based Spintronic Logic Units Operated by Spin Transfer Torque","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12443926","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5875889/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875889/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic Tunnel Junction-Based Spintronic Logic Units Operated by Spin Transfer Torque","sourcePdf":"tnano-yao-2158848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094617S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6122889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6122889","articleId":"5875889","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5875890,"authors":[{"name":"Chintan Patel","affiliation":["PEMC Group, The University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6099646/5875890/5875890-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chintan Patel (S\u201908) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from South Gujarat University, Surat, India, in 2000, the M.Tech. degree from Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree from Center for Electronics Design and Technology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 2011.","He is currently a Research Fellow at The University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K. His research interests include sensorless vector control and DTC of induction motors and hysteresis current controller."]},"firstName":"Chintan","lastName":"Patel","id":"37405466400"},{"name":"Rajeevan P.

The conventional DTC scheme uses a stator flux vector for the sector identification and then the switching vector to control stator flux and torque. However, the proposed DTC scheme selects switching vectors based on the sector information of the estimated fundamental stator voltage vector and its relative position with respect to the stator flux vector. The fundamental stator voltage estimation is based on the steady-state model of IM and the synchronous frequency of operation is derived from the computed stator flux using a low-pass filter technique. The proposed DTC scheme utilizes the exact positions of the fundamental stator voltage vector and stator flux vector to select the optimal switching vector for fast control of torque with small variation of stator flux within the hysteresis band. The present DTC scheme allows full load torque control with fast transient response to very low speeds of operation, with reduced switching frequency variation. Extensive experimental results are presented to show the fast torque control for speed of operation from zero to rated.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2159516","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6099646/05875890.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6099646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2159516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","startPage":"400","endPage":"410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Direct Torque Control of an Open-End Induction Motor Drive Using 12-Sided Polygonal Voltage Space Vectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5875890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fast Direct Torque Control of an Open-End Induction Motor Drive Using 12-Sided Polygonal Voltage Space Vectors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875890/","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5875890/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12409242","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Direct Torque Control of an Open-End Induction Motor Drive Using 12-Sided Polygonal Voltage Space Vectors","sourcePdf":"tpel-gopakumar-2159516-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099572S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6099646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6099646","articleId":"5875890","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5875893,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6112283/5875893/5875893-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhe Zhang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201911) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark, in 2010.","From 2005 to 2007, he was an Assistant Professor and Lecturer at Yanshan University.

It will be necessary to efficiently draw the energy from these two sources as well as recharge the energy storage elements by the dc bus. In this paper, a bidirectional isolated dc-dc converter controlled by phase-shift angle and duty cycle for the fuel-cell hybrid energy system is analyzed and designed. The proposed topology minimizes the number of switches and their associated gate driver components by using two high-frequency transformers that combine a half-bridge circuit and a full-bridge circuit together on the primary side. The voltage doubler circuit is employed on the secondary side. The current-fed input can limit the input current ripple that is favorable for fuel cells. The parasitic capacitance of the switches is used for zero voltage switching (ZVS). Moreover, a phase-shift and duty-cycle modulation method is utilized to control the bidirectional power flow flexibly and it also makes the converter operate under a quasi-optimal condition over a wide input voltage range. This paper describes the operation principle of the proposed converter, the ZVS conditions, and the quasi-optimal design in depth. The design guidelines and considerations regarding the transformers and other key components are given. Finally, a 1-kW 30~50-V-input 400-V-output laboratory prototype operating at 100-kHz switching frequency is built and tested to verify the effectiveness of the presented converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875893/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","volume":"27","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"12436973","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5875893/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of a Bidirectional Isolated DC\u2013DC Converter for Fuel Cells and Supercapacitors Hybrid System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of a Bidirectional Isolated DC\u2013DC Converter for Fuel Cells and Supercapacitors Hybrid System","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2159515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135005S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6112283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"6112283","articleId":"5875893","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5875903,"authors":[{"name":"Manohar Ayinala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5875903/5875903-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manohar Ayinala (S'10) received the Bachelor's degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India, in 2006 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2010, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include communication systems, digital signal processing and classification algorithms, and low-power/cost-efficient VLSI architectures and implementation."]},"firstName":"Manohar","lastName":"Ayinala","id":"37589801800"},{"name":"Keshab K.

The contribution of this paper is two fold. First, this paper presents a mathematical proof of existence of a linear transformation to transform LFSR circuits into equivalent state space formulations. This transformation achieves a full speed-up compared to the serial architecture at the cost of an increase in hardware overhead. This method applies to all generator polynomials used in CRC operations and BCH encoders. Second, a new formulation is proposed to modify the LFSR into the form of an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. We propose a novel high speed parallel LFSR architecture based on parallel IIR filter design, pipelining and retiming algorithms. The advantage of the proposed approach over the previous architectures is that it has both feedforward and feedback paths. We further propose to apply combined parallel and pipelining techniques to eliminate the fanout effect in long generator polynomials. The proposed scheme can be applied to any generator polynomial, i.e., any LFSR in general. The proposed parallel architecture achieves better area-time product compared to the previous designs.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2159495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2159495","startPage":"4459","endPage":"4469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5978836/05875903.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Parallel Architectures for Linear Feedback Shift Registers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Parallel Architectures for Linear Feedback Shift Registers","volume":"59","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205566","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5875903/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Parallel Architectures for Linear Feedback Shift Registers","sourcePdf":"tsp-ayinala-2159495-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141696S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5875903","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5875905,"authors":[{"name":"Nele Noels","affiliation":["TELIN Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5875905/5875905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nele Noels (M\u201911) received the diploma of electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Ghent University, Gent, Belgium, in 2001 and 2009, respectively.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher whose work is supported by the Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO Vlaanderen), with the Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University.

In this novel bio-inspired communication paradigm, molecules are employed to encode, transmit and receive information. In the most general case, these molecules are propagated in the medium by means of free diffusion. An information theoretical analysis of diffusion-based MC is required to better understand the potential of this novel communication mechanism. The study and the modeling of the noise sources is of utmost importance for this analysis. The objective of this paper is to provide a mathematical study of the noise at the reception of the molecular information in a diffusion-based MC system when the ligand-binding reception is employed. The reference diffusion-based MC system for this analysis is the physical end-to-end model introduced in a previous work by the same authors, where the reception process is realized through ligand-binding chemical receptors. The reception noise is modeled in this paper by following two different approaches, namely, through the ligand-receptor kinetics and through the stochastic chemical kinetics. The ligand-receptor kinetics allows to simulate the random perturbations in the chemical processes of the reception, while the stochastic chemical kinetics provides the tools to derive a closed-form solution to the modeling of the reception noise. The ligand-receptor kinetics model is expressed through a block scheme, while the stochastic chemical kinetics results in the characterization of the reception noise using stochastic differential equations. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the analytical formulation of the reception noise in terms of stochastic chemical kinetics is compliant with the reception noise behavior resulting from the ligand-receptor kinetics simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2159497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5978836/05875906.pdf","startPage":"4168","endPage":"4182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2159497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Analysis in Ligand-Binding Reception for Molecular Communication in Nanonetworks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5875906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Noise Analysis in Ligand-Binding Reception for Molecular Communication in Nanonetworks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875906/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12205569","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5875906/","volume":"59","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Analysis in Ligand-Binding Reception for Molecular Communication in Nanonetworks","sourcePdf":"tsp-pierobon-2159497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128861S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5875906","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5875908,"authors":[{"name":"Du Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Du","lastName":"Yang","id":"37407653300"},{"name":"Chao Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37714494600"},{"name":"Lie-Liang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Lie-Liang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279441800"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5875908","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":979},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Modulation","Antenna arrays","Indexes","Slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","diversity reception","MIMO communication","modulation","Monte Carlo methods","Rayleigh channels","synchronisation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit-diversity-assisted space-shift keying","colocated MIMO elements","distributed/cooperative MIMO elements","space-shift keying modulation","multiple-input-multiple-output technique","single transmit antenna","time slot","activated transmit antenna","interchannel interference","peak-to-mean power ratio","synchronization","transmit diversity gain potential","SSK-assisted systems","open-loop space-time space-shift keying","closed-loop feedback-aided phase rotation","feedback-aided power allocation","cooperative ST-SSK","Monte Carlo simulations","spatially independent Rayleigh fading channels","channel estimation errors","ST-SSK techniques","bit error rate","feedback overhead","deep shadow fading","spatial correlation","colocated antenna elements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify and forward (AF)","feedback","phase rotation","power allocation","space-shift keying (SSK)","space\u2013time","transmit diversity"]}],"abstract":"Space-shift keying (SSK) modulation is a recently proposed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technique, which activates only a single transmit antenna during each time slot and uses the specific index of the activated transmit antenna to implicitly convey information. Activating a single antenna is beneficial in terms of eliminating the interchannel interference and mitigates the peak-to-mean power ratio while avoiding the need for synchronization among transmit antennas. However, this benefit is achieved at a sacrifice, because the transmit diversity gain potential of the multiple transmit antennas is not fully exploited in existing SSK-assisted systems. Furthermore, a high-SSK throughput requires the transmitter to employ a high number of transmit antennas, which is not always practical. Hence, we propose four algorithms-open-loop space-time space-shift keying (ST-SSK), closed-loop feedback-aided phase rotation, feedback-aided power allocation, and cooperative ST-SSK-to achieve a diversity gain. The performance improvements of the proposed schemes are demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations for spatially independent Rayleigh fading channels. Their robustness to channel estimation errors is also considered. We advocate the proposed ST-SSK techniques, which can achieve a transmit diversity gain of about 10 dB at a bit error rate (BER) of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n, at the cost of imposing a moderate throughput loss that is dedicated to a modest feedback overhead. Furthermore, our proposed ST-SSK scheme lends itself to efficient communication, because the deleterious effects of deep shadow fading no longer impose spatial correlation on the signals that are received by the antennas, which cannot readily be avoided by colocated antenna elements.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2157185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5948446/05875908.pdf","startPage":"2864","endPage":"2869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2157185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5948446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit-Diversity-Assisted Space-Shift Keying for Colocated and Distributed/Cooperative MIMO Elements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5875908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875908/","displayDocTitle":"Transmit-Diversity-Assisted Space-Shift Keying for Colocated and Distributed/Cooperative MIMO Elements","volume":"60","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12108361","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5875908/","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit-Diversity-Assisted Space-Shift Keying for Colocated and Distributed/Cooperative MIMO Elements","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2157185-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076608S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5948446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5948446","articleId":"5875908","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5875910,"authors":[{"name":"Albert Yu-Min Lin","affiliation":["California Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6086909/5875910/5875910-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Albert Yu-Min Lin received the B.S. degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering and the M.Sci. and Ph.D. degrees in materials science and engineering from the University of California at San Diego in 2004, 2005, and 2008, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Research Scientist with the Center for Interdisciplinary Science in Art, Architecture and Archaeology at UC San Diego, a Fellow National of the Explorers Club, and an Emerging Explorer of the National Geographic Society.

For the satellite survey, 50 cm resolution pan-sharpened imagery was generated through a combination of multispectral and panchromatic data, collected from the GeoEye-1 earth-sensing satellite. The imagery was then used to identify the location of the aforementioned sites in an approximate area of 3000 km\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n . Aerial photographs of the sites were obtained with two customized electric-powered UAVs: a fixed flying wing rear-propulsion plane and a multi-propeller \u201coktokopter\u201d helicopter system. Finally, geophysical investigation was conducted with a GSM-19 Overhouser gradiometer, an EM38 electromagnetometer, and an IDS Detector Duo ground penetrating radar. The satellite imagery and aerial photographs were combined with the geophysical survey results and on-site surface observations to provide insight and contextual information about anomalies in multiple layers of data. The results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of the employed method for archaeological investigation in large, rugged and scarcely populated areas.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/6086909/05875910.pdf","startPage":"870","endPage":"876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2143696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2143696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086909","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5875910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining GeoEye-1 Satellite Remote Sensing, UAV Aerial Imaging, and Geophysical Surveys in Anomaly Detection Applied to Archaeology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellite navigation systems","Magnetic resonance imaging","Ground penetrating radar","Image resolution","Satellite broadcasting","Remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["archaeology","autonomous aerial vehicles","geophysical techniques","gravimeters","ground penetrating radar","magnetometers","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GeoEye-1 satellite remote sensing","UAV aerial imaging","geophysical survey","anomaly detection","archaeology","ultra high resolution satellite imaging","unmanned aerial vehicle photography","subsurface geophysical investigation","Northern Mongolia","Bronze Age burial mound","Turkish period tomb","steppe city fortification","pan sharpened imagery","multispectral data","panchromatic data","aerial photograph","rear propulsion plane","multipropeller oktokopter helicopter system","GSM-19 Overhouser gradiometer","EM38 electromagnetometer","IDS detector duo ground penetrating radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerial","anomaly detection","archaeology","electromagnetic survey","GeoEye-1","geophysics","ground penetrating radar","magnetic survey","remote sensing","satellite","UAV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Combining GeoEye-1 Satellite Remote Sensing, UAV Aerial Imaging, and Geophysical Surveys in Anomaly Detection Applied to Archaeology","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5875910/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12409181","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining GeoEye-1 Satellite Remote Sensing, UAV Aerial Imaging, and Geophysical Surveys in Anomaly Detection Applied to Archaeology","sourcePdf":"jstars-lin-2143696-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073942S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6086909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6086909","articleId":"5875910","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5875911,"authors":[{"name":"Jinn-Tsong Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Ping Tung University of Education, Ping Tung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Jinn-Tsong Tsai received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical and electromechanical engineering from National Sun Yat-Sen University, Taiwan, in 1986 and 1988, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering science and technology from National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, in 2004.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science, National Pingtung University of Education, Taiwan.

In this paper, the condensed encoding ensures that the chromosome is a feasible solution in all rows for Japanese nonograms. In the reconstruction process of a Japanese nonogram, the numbers in the left column are used as encoding conditions, and the numbers in the top row with the improved fitness function are employed to evaluate the reconstruction result. From the computational experiments, the proposed IGA approach is applied to solve Japanese nonograms effectively, with better results than using a CGA. The students of the Department of Computer Science, National Pingtung University of Education, Taiwan, have gained practical experience of applying evolutionary algorithms to solve Japanese nonograms using both the proposed IGA and a CGA.

In the near future, a large number of PHEVs in our society will add a large-scale energy load to our power grids, as well as add substantial energy resources that can be utilized. An emerging issue is that a large number of PHEVs simultaneously connected to the grid may pose a huge threat to the overall power system quality and stability. In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm for optimally managing a large number of PHEVs (e.g., 3000) charging at a municipal parking station. The authors used the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to intelligently allocate electrical energy to the PHEVs connected to the grid. A mathematical framework for the objective function (i.e., maximizing the average state-of-charge at the next time step) is also given.

The proposed IG_ST 8 T SRAM cells utilize split-gate FinFET devices with the front-gate devices serving as the stacking devices, and the back-gate devices serving as the intermediate node conditioning devices to provide built-in feedback mechanism for Schmitt Trigger action, thus reducing the cell transistor count/area and achieving improved static noise margin (SNM) and better tolerance to process variation and random variations. 3-D mixed-mode simulations are used to evaluate the Read static noise margin (RSNM), Write static noise margin (WSNM), hold static noise margin (HSNM), and Standby leakage of proposed cells, and results are compared with the standard 6 T cells and previously reported 10 T Schmitt Trigger sub-threshold SRAM cells. Compared with the conventional tied-gate 6 T cell, the proposed IG_ST SRAM cells demonstrate 1.81X and 2.11X higher nominal RSNM at \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">VCS</i>\n= 0.4 and 0.15 V, respectively. The cell layouts and areas are assessed based on scaled ground rules from 32 nm node, and the density advantage over previously reported 10 T Schmitt Trigger sub-threshold SRAM cells are illustrated. The cell AC performance (Read access time, Write time, and Read access time versus the number of cells per bit-line considering worst-case data pattern for bit-line leakage) and temperature dependence are evaluated, and shown to be adequate for the intended sub-threshold applications. Compared with previously reported 10 T Schmitt Trigger sub-threshold SRAM cells, the proposed cells exhibit comparable or better RSNM, higher density, and lower Standby leakage current. 3-D mixed-mode Monte Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the impacts of process variations (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">eff</sub>\n, EOT, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">W</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fin</sub>\n, and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">fin</sub>\n) and random variations (Gate LER and Fin LER) on RSNM, WSNM, and HSNM.

Any entity operating in cyberspace is susceptible to debilitating cyber attacks. As part of the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, the United States acknowledges that the speed and anonymity of cyber attacks makes distinguishing among the actions of terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult. Indeed, today's Internet is an incredibly effective, uncontrolled weapon for eavesdropping and spying. Therefore, anonymity and privacy are increasingly important issues. A plethora of existing or proposed anonymous networks achieve diverse levels of anonymity against a variety of adversarial attacks. However, no known taxonomy provides a comprehensive classification of the varied set of wired, wireless, and hybrid anonymous communications networks. We develop a novel cubic taxonomy to facilitate the systematic definition and classification of anonymity in anonymous communications networks. Three key anonymity components: anonymity property, adversary capability, and network type are thoroughly explored. More importantly, an in-depth description of a new tree-based taxonomy for the state-of-the-art in wireless anonymous protocols is offered. For completeness, a tree-based taxonomy of wired and hybrid anonymous protocols are also provided. Lastly, several evolving anonymity metrics which quantify anonymity preservation, degradation, and elimination in existing and future anonymous networks are examined. Hence, this paper explores extant and emerging issues in anonymous networks via an intuitive taxonomy and surveys anonymous protocols and quantifiable metrics essential for any entity determined to assure anonymity and preserve privacy in cyberspace against an adversary.","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.042011.00080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.042011.00080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6194370/05875920.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6194370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Extant and Emerging Issues in Anonymous Networks: A Taxonomy and Survey of Protocols and Metrics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Extant and Emerging Issues in Anonymous Networks: A Taxonomy and Survey of Protocols and Metrics","volume":"14","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2012","accessionNumber":"12711875","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5875920/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Extant and Emerging Issues in Anonymous Networks: A Taxonomy and Survey of Protocols and Metrics","sourcePdf":"20kelly80.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.204921S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6194370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6194370","articleId":"5875920","onlineDate":"13 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5875937,"authors":[{"name":"Milind Naphade","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The novel algorithm we propose is called SafeChoice (SC). Different from all previous approaches, SC is proposed based on a fundamental theorem, safe condition which guarantees that clustering would not degrade the placement wirelength. To mathematically derive such a theorem, we first introduce the concept of safe clustering, i.e., do clustering without degrading the placement quality. To efficiently check the safe condition for pair-wise clustering, we propose a technique called selective enumeration. SafeChoice maintains a global priority queue based on the safeness and area of potential clusters. Using a simple heuristic, it automatically stops clustering when generating more clusters would degrade the placement wirelength. Moreover, we extend SafeChoice to do clustering while considering the object physical locations, i.e., physical clustering. Finally, we apply SafeChoice into a two-phase placement framework and propose a high-quality analytical placement algorithm called SCPlace. Comprehensive experimental results show that the clusters produced by SC consistently help the placer to achieve the best wirelength among all other clustering algorithms, and SCPlace generates the best half-perimeter wirelength compared with all other state-of-the-art placers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Joining processes","Niobium","Runtime","Design automation","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit CAD","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SafeChoice","hypergraph clustering algorithm","wirelength-driven placement","placement wirelength","placement quality","pair-wise clustering","selective enumeration","global priority queue","two-phase placement framework","high-quality analytical placement algorithm","SCPlace"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hypergraph clustering","physical design","VLSI placement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5875968","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2114950","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5875967/05875968.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2114950","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5875967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SafeChoice: A Novel Approach to Hypergraph Clustering for Wirelength-Driven Placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SafeChoice: A Novel Approach to Hypergraph Clustering for Wirelength-Driven Placement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875968/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","volume":"30","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5875968/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049330","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SafeChoice: A Novel Approach to Hypergraph Clustering for Wirelength-Driven Placement","sourcePdf":"tcad-yan-2114950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.230996S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5875967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5875967","articleId":"5875968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5875969,"authors":[{"name":"Zigang Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5875967/5875969/5875969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zigang Xiao received the B.S. degree in computer science from Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshan) University, Guangzhou, China, in 2008, and the M.Phil. degree in computer science from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, in 2010.

In this paper, we solve the placement and droplet routing problem in cross-referencing biochips. In these biochips, the electrodes are addressed in a row-column manner, which may cause electrode interference that prevents simultaneous movements of multiple droplets. We propose a routing algorithm that solves the droplet routing problem directly. A two-coloring graph-theoretic method is used in our router to detect and prevent the electrode interference. In addition, we propose an integer linear programming based method to solve the placement problem. Our method considers the characteristics of cross-referencing biochips and is aware of droplet routing. Real-life benchmarks are used to evaluate the proposed methods. Compared with previous works, our router improves on average 4% in routing time and 58% in runtime. It can route all the benchmarks within the time limits, while the latest work fails in some cases. Moreover, experimental results show that by running our router on the placement result generated by our method and those generated by the latest work, an average improvement of 11%, 29%, 54%, and 46% in the maximum routing time, average routing time, stalling steps, and cell usage can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2113730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5875967/05875969.pdf","startPage":"1000","endPage":"1010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2113730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5875967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Placement and Routing for Cross-Referencing Digital Microfluidic Biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Placement and Routing for Cross-Referencing Digital Microfluidic Biochips","volume":"30","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049331","htmlLink":"/document/5875969/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Placement and Routing for Cross-Referencing Digital Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"tcad-young-2113730-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07988S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5875967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5875967","articleId":"5875969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5875970,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5875967/5875970/5875970-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Zhao (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering and the M.S. degree in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

Basic operations such as droplet dispensing, mixing, dilution, localized heating, and incubation can be carried out using a 2-D array of electrodes and nanoliter volumes of liquid. The number of independent input pins used to control the electrodes in such microfluidic \u201cbiochips\u201d is an important cost-driver, especially for disposable printed circuit board devices that are being developed for clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. However, most prior work on biochip design-automation has assumed independent control of the electrodes using a large number of input pins. We present a broadcast-addressing-based design technique for pin-constrained multifunctional biochips. The proposed method provides high throughput for bioassays and it reduces the number of control pins by identifying and connecting control pins with \u201ccompatible\u201d actuation sequences. We also describe two scheduling methods to map fluidic operations on the pin-constrained design, in order to minimize the completion time while avoiding pin-actuation conflicts. The proposed methods are evaluated using multifunctional chips designed to execute a set of multiplexed bioassays, the polymerase chain reaction, and a protein dilution assay.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2011.2116250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5875967/05875970.pdf","startPage":"986","endPage":"999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2011.2116250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5875967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcast Electrode-Addressing and Scheduling Methods for Pin-Constrained Digital Microfluidic Biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5875970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Broadcast Electrode-Addressing and Scheduling Methods for Pin-Constrained Digital Microfluidic Biochips","volume":"30","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049332","htmlLink":"/document/5875970/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcast Electrode-Addressing and Scheduling Methods for Pin-Constrained Digital Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"tcad-zhao-2116250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098598S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5875967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5875967","articleId":"5875970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5876081,"authors":[{"name":"John Hosking","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Hosking","id":"37282891200"},{"name":"Peter Smith","affiliation":["Department of Management and International Business, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Smith","id":"38164166400"},{"name":"Elisabeth Krull","affiliation":["Department of Management and International Business, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Krull","id":"38015116300"},{"name":"Nick Jones","affiliation":["Centre of eResearch, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Jones","id":"38030083800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0348-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0349-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0347-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-570X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0175"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1093-0175"}],"articleNumber":"5876081","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line measurements","Organizations","Conferences","Standards organizations","Software","Technological innovation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer science education","professional aspects","software engineering","strategic planning","team working","technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software engineering student","computer science course","business student","strategic business planning","IT organization","technology roadmapping","multidisciplinary context","communication skill","professional vocabulary"]}],"abstract":"We describe a multidisciplinary course introducing Software Engineering, Computer Science and Business students to strategic business planning in IT organizations using technology roadmapping as the focus of instruction.

In addition, software quality is a topic that is becoming increasingly important both because of educational and industry requirements. Software engineering lecturers need to bring their research into the classroom. Bringing all of these together can pose the lecturer with a dilemma that is not easily solvable. This paper presents how problem-based learning, a pedagogical methodology that is popular in medicine and other disciplines, can be used to accomplish these goals in a single course module.

The entire system requires very precise clock and trigger distribution, synchronous with the 1.3 GHz system RF-frequency, over distances of more than 3.4 km. The new experiment demanded features that other commercial solutions could not yet provide. Researchers at Stockholm University and DESY have developed a prototype for the timing system of XFEL. It has been decided that XFEL will use modern ATCA and Micro-TCA systems because of their advanced features and reliability. The timing system has been adapted to the Micro-TCA bus standard and also follows the new upcoming xTCA for physics standard. The prototype is fully functional and complete. It will serve as a platform for future development of the whole timing system.

The WOPIS contains a set of Clos-like optical switches and a handful of output FDL-based optical buffers. The RHNN scheduler determines an optimal set of neurons (I/O paths) to be enabled, achieving maximal system throughput and priority differentiation subject to the switch- and buffer-contention-free constraints. Structured with ranked neurons, the RHNN allows higher-rank neurons (higher-priority and/or lower-delay paths) to disable lower-rank neurons that have been enabled during previous iterations. Ranking the neurons unfortunately gives rise to a convergence problem. We present two theorems that give the sufficient conditions for the RHNN scheduler to converge to the optimal solution. We demonstrate via simulation results that, with the computation time within one system slot time, the RHNN scheduler achieves near 100% throughput and multi-level prioritized scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2159578","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5959262/05876292.pdf","startPage":"2436","endPage":"2446","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2159578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5959262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel QoS Scheduling for WDM Optical Interconnection System Using a New Ranked Hopfield Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Parallel QoS Scheduling for WDM Optical Interconnection System Using a New Ranked Hopfield Neural Network","volume":"29","issue":"16","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12175456","publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5876292/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel QoS Scheduling for WDM Optical Interconnection System Using a New Ranked Hopfield Neural Network","sourcePdf":"jlt-tien-2159578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08359S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5959262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5959262","articleId":"5876292","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5876300,"authors":[{"name":"William B.

We present distributed receding horizon control algorithms and derive sufficient conditions that guarantee asymptotic stability, leader-follower string stability, and predecessor-follower string stability, following a step speed change in the platoon. Vehicles compute their own control in parallel, and receive communicated position and velocity error trajectories from their immediate predecessor. Leader-follower string stability requires additional communication from the lead car at each update, in the form of a position error trajectory. Predecessor-follower string stability, as we define it, implies leader-follower string stability. Predecessor-follower string stability requires stricter constraints in the local optimal control problems than the leader-follower formulation, but communication from the lead car is required only once at initialization. Provided an initially feasible solution can be found, subsequent feasibility of the algorithms are guaranteed at every update. The theory is generalized for nonlinear decoupled dynamics, and is thus applicable to fleets of planes, robots, or boats, in addition to cars.

Overlapping multitemporal images are first organized into 256 m \u00d7 256 m tiles in a global grid reference system. The system quantifies the overall amount of change in a given tile with a tile change score as an aggregation of pixel-level changes. The tiles are initially ranked by these change scores for retrieval, review, and exploitation in a Web-based application. However, the ranking does not account for the wide variety of change types that are typically observed in the top-ranked change tiles. To automatically organize the wide variety of change patterns observed in multitemporal high-resolution imagery, we perform tile clustering using the competitive agglomeration (CA) algorithm stabilized using the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm. Each resulting cluster contains tiles with a visually similar type of change. By visual inspection of these tile clusters, GeoCDX users can quickly find certain types of change without having to sift through a large number of tiles initially organized solely by their tile change score, thereby reducing the time it takes for users to discover and exploit the change pattern(s) of greatest interest to a given application (e.g., urban growth, disaster assessment, facility monitoring, etc.). The tile clusters also provide a high-level overview of the various types of change that occur between the two observations. This overview is compared with a similar yet more limited view offered by a relevance feedback tool that requires a user to select sample tiles for use as samples in the reranking process.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2152847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6079321/05876314.pdf","startPage":"4687","endPage":"4703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2152847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering of Detected Changes in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Using a Stabilized Competitive Agglomeration Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876314/","displayDocTitle":"Clustering of Detected Changes in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Using a Stabilized Competitive Agglomeration Algorithm","volume":"49","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376454","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876314/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering of Detected Changes in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Using a Stabilized Competitive Agglomeration Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tgrs-sjahputera-2152847-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092551S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6079321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6079321","articleId":"5876314","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5876320,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Desjardins","affiliation":["Genetec, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada","Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Laval University, Quebec, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6082048/5876320/5876320-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Charles Desjardins received the degree in software engineering from Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada, in 2006, from which he also received the Master's degree (with honors) in computer science.","His research focused on applying machine learning techniques to the autonomous vehicle control systems problem.

Such systems aim at helping drivers by either providing a warning to reduce crashes or doing some of the control tasks to relieve a driver from repetitive and boring tasks. Thus, for example, adaptive cruise control (ACC) aims at relieving a driver from manually adjusting his/her speed to maintain a constant speed or a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him/her. Currently, ACC can be improved through vehicle-to-vehicle communication, where the current speed and acceleration of a vehicle can be transmitted to the following vehicles by intervehicle communication. This way, vehicle-to-vehicle communication with ACC can be combined in one single system called cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC). This paper investigates CACC by proposing a novel approach for the design of autonomous vehicle controllers based on modern machine-learning techniques. More specifically, this paper shows how a reinforcement-learning approach can be used to develop controllers for the secure longitudinal following of a front vehicle. This approach uses function approximation techniques along with gradient-descent learning algorithms as a means of directly modifying a control policy to optimize its performance. The experimental results, through simulation, show that this design approach can result in efficient behavior for CACC.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2157145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6082048/05876320.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2157145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6082048","startPage":"1248","endPage":"1260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: A Reinforcement Learning Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: A Reinforcement Learning Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12388561","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5876320/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: A Reinforcement Learning Approach","sourcePdf":"tits-desjardins-2157145-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079337S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6082048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"6082048","articleId":"5876320","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5876322,"authors":[{"name":"Meindert Niemeijer","affiliation":["University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Meindert","lastName":"Niemeijer","id":"37418440200"},{"name":"Xiayu Xu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiayu","lastName":"Xu","id":"38004822800"},{"name":"Alina V.

Tortuous and dilated arteries and veins, as well as decreased AVR are also markers for plus disease in retinopathy of prematurity. This work presents an automated method to estimate the AVR in retinal color images by detecting the location of the optic disc, determining an appropriate region of interest (ROI), classifying vessels as arteries or veins, estimating vessel widths, and calculating the AVR. After vessel segmentation and vessel width determination, the optic disc is located and the system eliminates all vessels outside the AVR measurement ROI. A skeletonization operation is applied to the remaining vessels after which vessel crossings and bifurcation points are removed, leaving a set of vessel segments consisting of only vessel centerline pixels. Features are extracted from each centerline pixel in order to assign these a soft label indicating the likelihood that the pixel is part of a vein. As all centerline pixels in a connected vessel segment should be the same type, the median soft label is assigned to each centerline pixel in the segment. Next, artery vein pairs are matched using an iterative algorithm, and the widths of the vessels are used to calculate the AVR. We trained and tested the algorithm on a set of 65 high resolution digital color fundus photographs using a reference standard that indicates for each major vessel in the image whether it is an artery or vein. We compared the AVR values produced by our system with those determined by a semi-automated reference system. We obtained a mean unsigned error of 0.06 (SD 0.04) in 40 images with a mean AVR of 0.67. A second observer using the semi-automated system obtained the same mean unsigned error of 0.06 (SD 0.05) on the set of images with a mean AVR of 0.66.

In lieu of a fusion center, local measurements must be disseminated across the network for each sensor to implement a centralized particle filter (PF). However, disseminating raw measurements incurs formidable communication overhead as large volumes of data are collected by the sensors. To reduce this overhead and thus enable distributed PF implementation, the present paper develops a set-membership constrained (SMC) PF approach that i) exhibits performance comparable to the centralized PF; ii) requires only communication of particle weights among neighboring sensors; and iii) can afford both consensus-based and incremental averaging implementations. These attractive attributes are effected through a novel adaptation scheme, which is amenable to simple distributed implementation using min- and max-consensus iterations. The resultant SMC-PF exhibits high gain over the bootstrap PF when the likelihood is peaky, but not in the tail of the prior. Simulations corroborate that for a fixed number of particles, and subject to peaky likelihood conditions, SMC-PF outperforms the bootstrap PF, as well as recently developed distributed PF algorithms, by a wide margin.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Set-Membership Constrained Particle Filter: Distributed Adaptation for Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2159599","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5978836/05876336.pdf","startPage":"4122","endPage":"4138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2159599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978836","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Set-Membership Constrained Particle Filter: Distributed Adaptation for Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5876336/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205570","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Set-Membership Constrained Particle Filter: Distributed Adaptation for Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-giannakis-2159599-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114961S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5978836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5978836","articleId":"5876336","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5876337,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangyuan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6017237/5876337/5876337-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiangyuan Li (M'10) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from South China University of Technology (SCUT), Guangzhou, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","From 2006 to 2008, he was a Research Associate at the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong.

Two different cooperation schemes are considered. In the first scheme, cooperating nodes retransmit a weighted version of the source signal in a decode-and-forward (DF) fashion. In the second scheme, referred to as cooperative jamming (CJ), while the source is transmitting, cooperating nodes transmit weighted noise to confound the eavesdropper. We investigate two objectives: i) maximization of the achievable secrecy rate subject to a total power constraint and ii) minimization of the total power transmit power under a secrecy rate constraint. For the first design objective, we obtain the exact solution for the DF scheme for the case of a single or multiple eavasdroppers, while for the CJ scheme with a single eavesdropper we reduce the multivariate problem to a problem of one variable. For the second design objective, existing work introduces additional constraints in order to reduce the degree of difficulty, thus resulting in suboptimal solutions. Our work raises those constraints, and obtains either an analytical solution for the DF scheme with a single eavesdropper, or reduces the multivariate problem to a problem of one variable for the CJ scheme with a single eavesdropper. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed results and compare them to existing work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","volume":"59","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12227864","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5876337/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Cooperative Relaying Schemes for Wireless Physical Layer Security","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Cooperative Relaying Schemes for Wireless Physical Layer Security","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2159598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093286S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6017237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"309","xplore-issue":"6017237","articleId":"5876337","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5876338,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Orlando","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInnovazione, Universit\u00e0 del Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5978836/5876338/5876338-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Danilo Orlando was born in Gagliano del Capo, Italy, on August 9, 1978.

A half-duplex regenerative multi-antenna relay station (RS) assists multiple communication groups. In each group, multiple half-duplex nodes communicate with each other. The number of communication phases is defined by the maximum number of nodes among all groups. In the first phase, i.e., the multiple-access (MAC) phase, all nodes simultaneously transmit to the RS, and the RS decodes the data streams of all nodes. In the following broadcast (BC) phases, the RS transmits to the nodes. We propose three BC strategies, i.e., unicasting, multicasting, and hybrid uni/multicasting. For the multicasting strategy, either superposition or exclusive or (xor ) network coding is applied. On the one hand, we propose a transmit beamforming algorithm minimizing the RS's transmit power while guaranteeing that each node receives with a rate equal to the rate received at the RS for each particular data stream. The transmit beamforming algorithm is designed by coupling the MAC and BC phases. On the other hand, for the case where the RS's transmit power is fixed, we design low-complexity transmit beamforming algorithms: matched filter, zero forcing, minimization of mean square error, and MGMW-aware transmit beamforming. It is shown that the multicasting strategy with xor network coding improves the achievable sum rate and requires the least transmit power compared with other strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2159636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05876341.pdf","startPage":"3017","endPage":"3029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2159636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regenerative Multi-Group Multi-Way Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876341/","displayDocTitle":"Regenerative Multi-Group Multi-Way Relaying","volume":"60","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219100","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876341/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regenerative Multi-Group Multi-Way Relaying","sourcePdf":"tvt-amah-2159636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120018S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5876341","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5876347,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Among many of their merits, loss and THD reduction and voltage profile improvement can be the salient specifications of DG. Studies show that non-optimal locations and non-optimal sizes of DG units may lead to losses increase, together with bad effect on voltage profile and harmonics. So, this paper aims at determining optimal DG allocation and sizing. To do so, the heuristic optimization technique named Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used as the solving tool to minimize simultaneously the economic cost of overall system by changing sitting and varying sizes of DGs. In this optimization method, the investment cost of DGs and power losses are considered in order to being minimized. Firstly, a radial distribution power flow (PF) algorithm is executed to find the global optimal solution. Then, with respect to voltage profile, THD and loss reduction and by using the sensitivity analysis, PSO is used to calculate the objective function and to verify bus voltage limits. To include the presence of harmonics, PSO was integrated with a harmonic power flow algorithm (HPF). The proposed (PSO-HPF) based approach is tested on an IEEE 15-bus radial distribution system. Finally, the returning of investmental cost is calculated to show the economic justification of DG placement. These scenarios yields efficiency in improvement of voltage profile and reduction of THD and power losses; it also permits an increase in power transfer capacity and maximum loading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal distributed generation placement and sizing for loss and thd reduction and voltage profile improvement in distribution systems using particle swarm optimization and sensitivity analysis [abstract only]","publicationTitle":"16th Electrical Power Distribution Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"16th Electrical Power Distribution Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783453/5876343/05876347.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876347/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal distributed generation placement and sizing for loss and thd reduction and voltage profile improvement in distribution systems using particle swarm optimization and sensitivity analysis [abstract only]","conferenceDate":"19-20 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal distributed generation placement and sizing for loss and thd reduction and voltage profile improvement in distribution systems using particle swarm optimization and sensitivity analysis [abstract only]","confLoc":"Bandar Abbas, Iran","sourcePdf":"Abstractdgr2745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023732S","chronDate":"19-20 April 2011","isNumber":"5876343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783453","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5876347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5876383,"authors":[{"name":"Moein Moeini-Aghtaie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5783453/5876343/5876383/5876383-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Moein Moeini-Aghtaie (S'11) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman and Sharif University of Technology in 2009 and 2011 respectively.

It seems rather logical to increase the electricity production proportional to the increasing rate of the demand. Distributed Generation (DG) has been recently accepted to be one of the most efficient means of electricity generation, particularly near to the load centers. The DG has been also considered in the generation expansion planning of power systems. In this paper, three main factors associated with the DGs placement procedure is scrutinized through a multi-objective optimization approach. One of the main factors considered in this paper is the network loss. The costs associated with the investment, operation, and maintenance of the DGs, together with the reliability worth and customer interruption cost are the other two criteria to be investigated in this paper. A multi-objective optimization approach is then proposed and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGAII) as a convenient tool to deal with such a problem is utilized. The methodology well proves its applicability and efficiency by being applied to a real electric power distribution system.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"16th Electrical Power Distribution Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876343","displayPublicationTitle":"16th Electrical Power Distribution Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783453/5876343/05876383.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Distributed Generation placement in a restructured environment via a multi-objective optimization approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876383/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Distributed Generation placement in a restructured environment via a multi-objective optimization approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876383/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12063450","publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","conferenceDate":"19-20 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 April 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Distributed Generation placement in a restructured environment via a multi-objective optimization approach","confLoc":"Bandar Abbas, Iran","sourcePdf":"dgr3010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067931S","chronDate":"19-20 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783453","isNumber":"5876343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783453","xplore-issue":"5876343","articleId":"5876383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Iranian Assoc of Electrical","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5876384,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Afaghzadeh","affiliation":["Technical Engineering Department, University of Mohaghegh, Iran"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Afaghzadeh","id":"38016014700"},{"name":"Khalil Valipoor","affiliation":["Technical Engineering Department, University of Mohaghegh, Iran"],"firstName":"Khalil","lastName":"Valipoor","id":"37992478300"},{"name":"Mehdi Ebtehaj","affiliation":["Ardabil Province Electric Energy Distribution Company, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Ebtehaj","id":"38016015500"},{"name":"Hossein Ghadimi","affiliation":["Ardabil Province Electric Energy Distribution Company, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Ghadimi","id":"38016015900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0666-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-9-6446-3149-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876384","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substations","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic distortion","particle swarm optimisation","power capacitors","power distribution planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal capacitor placement","voltage source harmonic distortion effect","radial distribution networks","binary particle swarm optimization","double harmonic current injection","network loss reduction","28-bus IEEE standard","voltage profile improvement","network load"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal capacitor placement","voltage source distortion harmonic","binary PSO","loss reduction and voltage profile improvement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876384","abstract":"This paper proposed a binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) for capacitor optimal placement on radial distribution network.

Nevertheless, some authors indicate that those methods based on artificial intelligence, may be a good alternative. Thus, fuzzy classifiers, which are based on Fuzzy Logic, include additional information in the classification process through based-rule systems. In this work, we propose the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the optimal and minimum set of fuzzy rules to classify remotely sensed images. Input information of GA has been obtained through the training space determined by two uncorrelated spectral bands (2D scatter diagrams), which has been irregularly divided by five linguistic terms defined in each band.

No knowledge of the spreading codes used by the primary CDMA network is available to the cooperative secondary users a priori, other than the spreading factor. An evolutionary algorithm of relatively low complexity order is proposed based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for assigning spreading codes to secondary users such that the mutual interference between existing secondary and primary users is minimized. This is accomplished at the secondary fusion center by minimizing the mean square cross-correlation between the candidate codes and the matrix which includes all independently received signals by the cooperative secondary users. Simulation results show that performance of the ACO-based method can converge to the optimal interference minimizing code assignment method while the complexity order is significantly reduced.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ant Colony Optimization approach to interference minimizing code assignment in cognitive CDMA networks","publicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876441","displayPublicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784216/5876433/05876441.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Ant Colony Optimization approach to interference minimizing code assignment in cognitive CDMA networks","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876441/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12069870","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ant Colony Optimization approach to interference minimizing code assignment in cognitive CDMA networks","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a19shafiee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073462S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5876442,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Gundry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Gundry","id":"37281644700"},{"name":"Elkin Urrea","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Elkin","lastName":"Urrea","id":"37391487100"},{"name":"Cem \u015eafak \u015eahin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Cem \u015eafak","lastName":"\u015eahin","id":"37547092700"},{"name":"Jianmin Zou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Zou","id":"38022758900"},{"name":"M. \u00dcmit Uyar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"M. \u00dcmit","lastName":"Uyar","id":"37282412800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876442","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Mobile communication","Convergence","Topology","Genetic algorithms","Mobile computing","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","genetic algorithms","Markov processes","mobile ad hoc networks","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal convergence analysis","bioinspired topology control","MANET","decision making process","mobile ad hoc network","stochastic model","dynamical system model","ergodic homogeneous Markov chain","force-based genetic algorithm","FGA","Dobrushin's contraction coefficients"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876442","abstract":"We present a convergence analysis of a genetic algorithm based topological control mechanism for the decision making process of evolutionary and autonomous systems that adaptively reconfigures spatial configuration in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).

It is shown that the Markov chain model of our FGA is ergodic and its convergence is shown using Dobrushin's contraction coefficients.

Tuple search (TS) sphere detection was recently introduced, demonstrating to represent a promising approach in this context. It provides significant complexity reduction in comparison to conventional algorithms, providing in addition close to full max-log-APP BER performance. Due to the increasing multiplicity of communication standards as well as variety of mobile applications demanded by users, tackling the lack of flexibility of common receiver realizations has become an additional key challenge in MIMO detection. Aim of this work is to demonstrate that the benefit provided by the tuple search strategy is still present in a wide range of possible transmission schemes. For this purpose, a novel efficiency indicator is introduced, based on which an exhaustive analysis is performed. The existing tuple search detector has been adapted to deal with different constellation orders and transmit/receive antenna configurations. In addition, the applied MMSE strategy has been modified to support undetermined systems. The obtained results show the superiority of the proposed sphere detector under different transmission conditions, thus demonstrating its efficiency and flexibility.","displayPublicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784216/5876433/05876450.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey on an efficient, low-complex tuple search based sphere detector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Bit error rate","MIMO","Detectors","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","error statistics","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","search problems","space division multiplexing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complex tuple search based sphere detector","MIMO communications","spatial multiplexing","full max-log-APP BER performance","receiver realizations","transmit-receive antenna configurations","MMSE strategy","sphere decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO detection","sphere decoder","tuple search","efficiency","overhead","asymmetric MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Survey on an efficient, low-complex tuple search based sphere detector","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876450/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12069878","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey on an efficient, low-complex tuple search based sphere detector","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a29adeva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067636S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5876451,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Montezuma","affiliation":["UNINOVA Instituto de Desenvolvimento de Novas Tecnologias, Caparica, Portugal","DEE, FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Montezuma","id":"37348727400"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["IT, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f3es, Lisboa, Portugal","DEE, FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"},{"name":"Miguel Luzio","affiliation":["DEE, FCT, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Luzio","id":"37392215400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876451","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":186},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Gain","Encoding","Nonlinear distortion","Transmitters","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","modulation coding","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficient coded 16-OQAM schemes","nonlinear transmitters","wireless communications","nonlinearly coded M-OQAM modulations","nonlinearly coded offset quadrature amplitude modulation","nonlinear OQPSK signals","nonlinear offset quadrature phase shift keying signals","pulse modulation","nonlinear amplifiers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonlinear amplification","power efficiency","nonlinear OQPSK-type signals","coding gain"]}],"abstract":"High power and spectral efficiencies are crucial on modern wireless communications.

However, due to large envelope fluctuations levels, nonlinear operations such as an high power amplification are undesirable since can they lead to performance degradation and spectral widening. Nonlinearly coded M-OQAM (Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) modulations can be viewed as a particular case of nonlinear OQPSK signals (Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) when the pulse modulation is designed to take advantage from the nonlinear format. In this paper we present nonlinearly encoded 16-OQAM schemes, based on two nonlinear OQPSK signals, designed to allow higher amplification efficiencies due its robustness against nonlinear distortions. The proposed approach assures an higher robustness against nonlinear effects, namely spectral regrowth and performance degradation. The consequences are improved performances over several drive operations of nonlinear amplifiers and a better compromise between bandwidth and power efficiencies.

The impact of the cooperating set size on system performance is predicted through the analysis of a simplified system, and then confirmed through numerical results of the whole system using the proposed scheduler.","displayPublicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784216/5876433/05876454.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UE centric coordinated beamforming in multi-cell MU-MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","System performance","Joints","Noise","Complexity theory","Array signal processing","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","MIMO communication","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user equipment centric coordinated beamforming","UE centric coordinated beamforming","multicell MU-MIMO systems","cooperating set size","joint space-time-frequency proportionally fair scheduler"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinated Beamforming","3GPP LTE-A","MIMO Systems","Scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"UE centric coordinated beamforming in multi-cell MU-MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876454/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12069881","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UE centric coordinated beamforming in multi-cell MU-MIMO systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a34li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068793S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5876455,"authors":[{"name":"Ajit Reddy","affiliation":["COBHAM Sensor System, USA"],"firstName":"Ajit","lastName":"Reddy","id":"38018019300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876455","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","signal decoding","low complexity methods","antennas","signal detection"]}],"abstract":"A typical MIMO system utilizes multiple antennas to transmit simultaneously several independent data streams to the receiver end. As a result of this inter-stream interference is said to occur since the reception of each stream at the receiver will be disturbed not only by noise but from the interference of other streams as well. In order to successfully detect and decode the received signal, joint detection and decoding can be employed to separate and recover the transmitted data in the best possible manner. This approach has huge complexity which grows exponentially as the number of antennas increases, thus prohibiting its implementation in a real time system. For real time implementation computationally effective methods are sought after but which often does not necessarily yield the best performance thus incurring a performance-complexity trade-off. The current research in this area has led to the development of both linear and non-linear techniques most of which are computationally intensive and complex. This paper discusses low complexity methods which are suitable for real time applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient decoding methods in MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876455","displayPublicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784216/5876433/05876455.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient decoding methods in MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876455/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12069882","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient decoding methods in MIMO systems","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a35reddy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035118S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5876456,"authors":[{"name":"Feichi Long","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feichi","lastName":"Long","id":"38008201900"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189000"},{"name":"Ruohan Cao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruohan","lastName":"Cao","id":"38028640400"},{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403296700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876456","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":543},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Complexity theory","Image edge detection","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Belief propagation","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","fading channels","graph theory","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single edge based belief propagation algorithms","MIMO channel detection","low-complexity belief propagation based detectors","multiple-input multiple-out system","computational complexity","Gaussian approximation","feedback information mechanism","single edge BP detector","pseudo priori information","linear MIMO detector","numerical simulations","factor graph","frequency-flat fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO detection","Belief propagation (BP)","factor graph"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, two low-complexity belief propagation (BP) based detectors are proposed for multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) system. The factor graph is leveraged to represent the MIMO channels, and based on which our algorithms are developed. Unlike the existing complicated standard BP detectors that consider all the edges when updating the messages, our algorithms only focus on single edge, which largely reduce computational complexity. In particular, we propose a novel Gaussian approximation with feedback information (GF) mechanism to enable the proposed single edge BP detector. In order to further improve the detection performance, we also propose to integrate the linear MIMO detector into the initial GF based single edge BP detector, where the pseudo priori (PP) information obtained from linear detector is judiciously exploited. Convergence and complexity analyses, along with the numerical simulations, verify that the proposed single edge BP detectors outperform the existing BP detectors in performance while with low complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single edge based belief propagation algorithms for MIMO detection","publicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876456","displayPublicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784216/5876433/05876456.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Single edge based belief propagation algorithms for MIMO detection","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876456/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12069883","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single edge based belief propagation algorithms for MIMO detection","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a36long.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071427S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5876457,"authors":[{"name":"Dorra Ben Cheikh Battikh","affiliation":["TELECOM Paris Tech & CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Dorra Ben Cheikh","lastName":"Battikh"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Kelif","affiliation":["Issy-les-moulineaux, Orange Labs, Issy-les-moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Kelif","id":"37391908400"},{"name":"Marceau Coupechoux","affiliation":["TELECOM Paris Tech & CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marceau","lastName":"Coupechoux","id":"37391907600"},{"name":"Philippe Godlewski","affiliation":["TELECOM Paris Tech & CNRS LTCI, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Godlewski","id":"37298520700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876457","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","MIMO","Receivers","Interference","Admission control","Rayleigh channels","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","diversity reception","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic system performance","SISO schemes","MIMO Alamouti schemes","maximum ratio combining receiver system","MISO Alamouti transmission system","mean flow throughput","downlink Rayleigh channel","multicellular system","admission control"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the performance of a SISO system, a 2 \u00d7 1 MISO Alamouti transmission system and a 2 \u00d7 N MIMO Alamouti transmission with maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver system is studied in terms of mean flow throughput per user.

There is an increasing need for capacity to support multi-media and other bandwidth-intensive applications while spectrum availability is decreasing. Directional networks allow for high capacity communications by focusing the energy between transmitter and receiver and providing greater frequency reuse. These networks can either be radio frequency (RF) or optical (free-space optical communications). The engineering cost of this improved capability is increased complexity of network formation and control in mobile network applications. In a traditional wireless network, neighbors can be detected through their omnidirectional antennas as long as they are in range. In directional networks, we contend with the \u201cdeafness\u201d problem in that the other nodes are involved in beam-to-beam directional communications and cannot \u201chear\u201d the new node as it attempts to enter a network. The problem of how to enable new nodes to enter or establish a network is called directional network discovery. There has been research conducted on how this can be efficiently implemented with various antenna and protocol innovations. In this paper, we focus on the performance of mobile network discovery techniques and the security of the discovery process.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876433","publicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784216/5876433/05876462.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876462","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional network discovery performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876462/","displayDocTitle":"Directional network discovery performance","htmlLink":"/document/5876462/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12069889","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional network discovery performance","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a41nichols.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072262S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5876464,"authors":[{"name":"Marceau Coupechoux","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, LTCI, CNRS, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marceau","lastName":"Coupechoux","id":"37391907600"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Kelif","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Kelif","id":"37391908400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876464","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1073},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Conferences","Downlink","Vehicular and wireless technologies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","compensation","Long Term Evolution","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional power control compensation factor","long term evolution","LTE cellular networks","uplink power control procedure","open-loop part","closed loop part","signal to interference plus noise ratio","eNode-B","average cell spectral efficiency"]}],"abstract":"The uplink power control procedure in Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular networks is made of an open-loop part and a closed loop part.

Furthermore, it is important to assess energy efficiency improvements from an operator's point of view, since energy costs are increasing and providing ubiquitous high speed mobile access may scale up the operators' operational expenditure. One of two promising approaches to enhance a network's operation regarding energy efficiency is to utilize smaller microcells within one large macrocell. Another approach is to regard macro base stations as coverage providers for areas in between microcells, while reducing their maximum transmit powers to a minimum. In this paper we investigate on the energy efficiency of a heterogeneous OFDM-based mobile network in the downlink taking into account the co-channel interference based on varying traffic demand per area. Furthermore, we carry out an assessment of potential energy savings of the two approaches mentioned above. For a sufficiently large traffic demand, increasing deployment densitiy through additional micro sites may maximize a network's energy efficiency. In that case the network operates at a load of less than 50%. Moreover, a further gain of energy efficiency of about 20% can be achieved due to macrosite transmit power reduction while still providing coverage.","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876468","publicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784216/5876433/05876468.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency gains in interference-limited heterogeneous cellular mobile radio networks with random micro site deployment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876468/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency gains in interference-limited heterogeneous cellular mobile radio networks with random micro site deployment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12069895","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876468/","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency gains in interference-limited heterogeneous cellular mobile radio networks with random micro site deployment","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a4klessig.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041321S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5876469,"authors":[{"name":"I-Tai Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"I-Tai","lastName":"Lu","id":"37297371700"},{"name":"Jialing Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Jialing","lastName":"Li","id":"37405653300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876469","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"abstract":"Two novel numerically efficient approaches are proposed for maximum capacity designs in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems under the practical per-antenna power constraint.

The ES is optimum and the EIA is nearly optimum in the maximum capacity sense. The key advantage of the EIA is that the number of data streams (i.e., the rank of the transmit covariant matrix) can be pre-specified and therefore tradeoffs between multiplexing and diversity gains can be facilitated. Numerical results show that the capacity and MSE performances with the more practical per-antenna power constraint are very similar to those with the less practical total power constraint.","displayPublicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784216/5876433/05876469.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel rank-constrained maximum capacity MIMO designs under practical per-antenna power constraint","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Decoding","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Closed-form solution","Joints","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","iterative methods","MIMO communication","multiplexing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rank-constrained maximum capacity MIMO designs","per-antenna power constraint","multiple-input multiple-output systems","explicit solution","channel matrix rank","transmit antennas","efficient iterative approach","data streams","multiplexing","diversity gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint transceiver design","MIMO systems","Rank constraint","Maximum capacity","Per-antenna power constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Novel rank-constrained maximum capacity MIMO designs under practical per-antenna power constraint","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876469/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12069896","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel rank-constrained maximum capacity MIMO designs under practical per-antenna power constraint","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a50lu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05006S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5876470,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Grieger","affiliation":["Vodafone Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Grieger","id":"37393375200"},{"name":"Peter Helbing","affiliation":["Vodafone Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Helbing","id":"38016171000"},{"name":"Gerhard Fettweis","affiliation":["Vodafone Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Fettweis","id":"37271859700"},{"name":"Patrick Marsch","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks Research, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Marsch","id":"37300839700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876470","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Training","Frequency domain analysis","Time domain analysis","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","data compression","interference suppression","mobile antennas","scheduling","signal detection","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field trial evaluation","distributed antenna systems","scalar compression algorithms","coordinated multipoint","cellular uplink","spectral efficiency","intercell interference","coordinated scheduling","coherent joint detection","backhaul infrastructure","base stations","source coding","vector compression algorithms","SINR","equalized transmit signals"]}],"abstract":"Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) in the cellular uplink, offering large improvements in spectral efficiency and fairness, appears to be an effective option to combat inter-cell interference.

Unfortunately, due to the limitations and/or impracticalities of the proposed designs, the expected performance gains have yet to be realized. In this work, a decentralized framework (and various example designs) is proposed for the practical transceiver and signaling design of a K-pair system desiring to employ CBF. Relying on channel soundings from the users and equivalent channel soundings from the cell sites (all on the same frequency), the optimum performance of centralized interference alignment designs is achieved (if not surpassed) when each pair's number of data streams is equal to its user's number of antennas. In addition, higher sum capacities than the generalized iterative approach, a centralized MMSE CBF design, are numerically observed. Clearly, practical CBF designs which can deliver the expected performance gains are finally available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12069903","htmlLink":"/document/5876477/","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Practical decentralized high-performance coordinated beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical decentralized high-performance coordinated beamforming","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a59lu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083492S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5876478,"authors":[{"name":"Farnaz Shayegh","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Farnaz","lastName":"Shayegh","id":"37397297400"},{"name":"M.

Assuming a Poisson model for the arrival of primary users, we analyze the goodput and the throughput of secondary users. Rateless codes are used for transmitting the secondary data through parallel subchannels available in a spectrum. They can compensate for the packet loss in secondary transmission due to appearance of primary users. We calculate the overall frame error probability at the secondary receiver and use it for calculating the throughput and goodput. Numerical results indicate that LT codes as a class of rateless codes provide reliable transmissions with high throughput and small redundancy. Except for very small Poisson arrival rates, the throughput is much higher than the case without erasure coding. Therefore, in real-time multimedia transmission that retransmitting lost information packets is not possible, the use of rateless codes is very beneficial.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876478/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12069904","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876478/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rateless codes for cognitive radio in a virtual unlicensed spectrum","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rateless codes for cognitive radio in a virtual unlicensed spectrum","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a5shayegh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130452S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5876479,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Boksiner","affiliation":["US Army Communications Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Boksiner","id":"37392003400"},{"name":"Sintayehu Dehnie","affiliation":["SABRE Systems, Manasquan, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sintayehu","lastName":"Dehnie","id":"37294741200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876479","dbTime":"69 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Bandwidth","Probability","Signal to noise ratio","Delay","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["military communication","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy detection","averaging","maximum values detection","opportunistic dynamic spectrum access","Department of Defense","spectrum sensing","energy sensing","total signal energy","random power signals","constant power signals","equivalent average power","incumbent signal detection","wideband signals","Neyman-Pearson criterion","Chernoff-Stein Lemma","detection probability","detection delay","radio policy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Spectrum Access","DSA","energy detection","signal detection","spectrum sensing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of energy detection using averaging and maximum values detection for dynamic spectrum access","doi":"10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876433","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"34th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784216/5876433/05876479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SARNOF.2011.5876479","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876479","abstract":"Opportunistic Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) systems are emerging as a key to enable the Department of Defense (DoD) to meet its technology requirements for access to the electromagnetic spectrum. One of the main goals of DSA is to protect incumbent spectrum users from interference that could be caused by DSA emitters. One of the ways to accomplish this is through spectrum sensing as means to enable the DSA system to detect the presence of emissions from other spectrum users. A simple and practical approach to spectrum sensing is energy sensing that detects other users on the basis of the total signal energy in channel of a given bandwidth. In this paper our goal is to investigate the performance of energy sensing for constant and random power signals using two approaches. The first approach that has been investigated extensively in the past uses the total energy, or equivalent average power, over the entire signal bandwidth as the basis for detecting incumbent signals. The second approach, which needs to be used for wideband signals if the bandwidth of the incumbent signal is not known, uses signal energy in individual FFT bins as the basis for detection. We examine the performance of these detection approach under the Neyman-Pearson criterion and also using the Chernoff-Stein Lemma to obtain the achievable detection probability as a function of detection delay. We find that the method using average over the entire signal achieves better performance than the method that uses values of individual bins. This shows the importance of prior knowledge that can be expressed as radio policy to enable coexistence of DSA with incumbent systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12069905","htmlLink":"/document/5876479/","conferenceDate":"3-4 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of energy detection using averaging and maximum values detection for dynamic spectrum access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of energy detection using averaging and maximum values detection for dynamic spectrum access","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"a60boksiner.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090574S","chronDate":"3-4 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784216","isNumber":"5876433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784216","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5876433","articleId":"5876479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5876482,"authors":[{"name":"Farooq Khan","affiliation":["Dallas Technology Laboratory, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Farooq","lastName":"Khan","id":"37280820600"},{"name":"Zhouyue Pi","affiliation":["Dallas Technology Laboratory, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zhouyue","lastName":"Pi","id":"37269226900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-680-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-681-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876482","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2086},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Dipole antennas","Rain","Attenuation","Fresnel reflection","Broadband communication","Aperture antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","microwave propagation","millimetre wave propagation","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mmWave mobile broadband","cellular mobile communications","first generation analog systems","second generation digital systems","third generation WCDMA","fourth generation OFDMA systems","ultra high frequency band","spectrum availability","frequency 3 GHz to 300 GHz"]}],"abstract":"Almost all cellular mobile communications including first generation analog systems, second generation digital systems, third generation WCDMA, and fourth generation OFDMA systems use Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band of radio spectrum with frequencies in the range of 300 MHz-3 GHz.

Driven by a new generation of devices (smart phones, MIDs, netbooks, etc.), capacity demand increases faster than spectral efficiency improvement, particularly at hotspots/areas. Also, as services migrate from voice centric to data centric, more users operate indoors, which requires increased link budget and coverage extension to provide uniform user experience. Traditional networks optimized for homogeneous traffic face unprecedented challenges to meet the demand cost effectively. Most recently, Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE)-Advanced has started a new study item to investigate heterogeneous network (HetNet) deployments as an efficient way to improve system capacity as well as effectively enhance network coverage. Unlike traditional heterogeneous networks that deal with the interworking of wireless local area networks and cellular networks, which the research community has already studied for more than a decade, in this new paradigm in the cellular network domain, a HetNet is a network containing nodes with different characteristics such as transmission power and radio frequency (RF) coverage area. Low-power micro nodes and high-power macro nodes can be maintained under the management of the same operator. They can share the same frequency band, provided by the operator. In this case, joint radio resource/interference management needs to be provided to ensure the coverage of low-power nodes. In some other cases, the low- and highpower nodes can use discontinuous bands of an operator separately (e.g., through carrier aggregation) so that strong interference with each other can be avoided. Macro network nodes with large RF coverage areas are deployed in a planned way for blanket coverage of urban, suburban, and rural areas. Local nodes with small RF coverage areas aim to complement the macro network nodes for coverage extension or throughput enhancement. In addition to this, global coverage can be provided by satellites (macrocells) according to an integrated system concept. The objective of Het-Nets targets the improvement of overall capacity as well as a cost-effective coverage extension and green radio solution by deploying additional network nodes within the local area range, such as low-power micro/pico network nodes, home-evolved Node-Bs (HeNBs)/closed subscriber group (CSG) cells, and femto and relay nodes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Special issues and sections","Cellular networks","Communication system security","Wireless sensor networks","Channel capacity","Broadband communication","Ad hoc networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.5876495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5876489/05876495.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.5876495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hetnets - a new paradigm for increasing cellular capacity and coverage [Guest Editorial]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hetnets - a new paradigm for increasing cellular capacity and coverage [Guest Editorial]","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876495/","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876495/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hetnets - a new paradigm for increasing cellular capacity and coverage [Guest Editorial]","sourcePdf":"006LYT-GUESTEDIT-Qian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0238S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5876489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5876489","articleId":"5876495","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5876496,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandar Damnjanovic","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., USA"],"bio":{"p":["Aleksandar D.

However, in already dense deployments in today's networks, cell splitting gains can be severely limited by high inter-cell interference. Moreover, high capital expenditure cost associated with high power macro nodes further limits viability of such an approach. This article discusses the need for an alternative strategy, where low power nodes are overlaid within a macro network, creating what is referred to as a heterogeneous network. We survey current state of the art in heterogeneous deployments and focus on 3GPP LTE air interface to describe future trends. A high-level overview of the 3GPP LTE air interface, network nodes, and spectrum allocation options is provided, along with the enabling mechanisms for heterogeneous deployments. Interference management techniques that are critical for LTE heterogeneous deployments are discussed in greater detail. Cell range expansion, enabled through cell biasing and adaptive resource partitioning, is seen as an effective method to balance the load among the nodes in the network and improve overall trunking efficiency. An interference cancellation receiver plays a crucial role in ensuring acquisition of weak cells and reliability of control and data reception in the presence of legacy signals.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.5876496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.5876496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5876489/05876496.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey on 3GPP heterogeneous networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A survey on 3GPP heterogeneous networks","volume":"18","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876496/","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12062891","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876496/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey on 3GPP heterogeneous networks","sourcePdf":"007DAMNJANOVICLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083623S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5876489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"1249","xplore-issue":"5876489","articleId":"5876496","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5876497,"authors":[{"name":"David Lopez-Perez","affiliation":["King''s College, UK"],"bio":{"p":["David L6pez-perez (david.lopez@kcl.ac.uk) received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in telecommunication from Miguel Hernandez University, Elche, Spain, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

Leveraging network topology, increasing the proximity between the access network and the end users, has the potential to provide the next significant performance leap in wireless networks, improving spatial spectrum reuse and enhancing indoor coverage. Nevertheless, deployment of a large number of small cells overlaying the macrocells is not without new technical challenges.

We then focus on multitier deployments with single RAT and investigate the challenges associated with enabling single frequency reuse across tiers. Based on the spectrum usage, heterogeneous networks can be categorized into single carrier usage, where all devices within the network share the same spectrum, and distinct carrier usage, where different types of devices are allocated separate spectra. For single carrier usage, we show that interference management schemes are critical for reducing the resulting cross-tier interference, and present several techniques that provide significant capacity and coverage improvements.

However, some unique features present a challenge in interference mitigation in a two-tier heterogeneous network such as random deployment for femtocells, nonexistence of macro-femto backhaul coordination, and mandates allowing no modifications of existing macrocells. Carefully examining the existing distributed information acquisition mechanisms, cognitive radio is the most promising solution for two-tier heterogeneous networks. We therefore study possible interference mitigation approaches, including orthogonal radio resource assignment in the time-frequency and antenna spatial domains, as well as interference cancellation via novel decoding techniques. According to the information acquired by cognitive radio technology, recent innovations such as game theory and the Gibbs sampler have been explored to mitigate both cross-tier and intratier interferences. Performance evaluations show that considerable performance improvement can be generally achieved, and thus demonstrate the potential of applying cognitive radio in mitigating interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On exploiting cognitive radio to mitigate interference in macro/femto heterogeneous networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.5876499","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5876489/05876499.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.5876499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876499/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"On exploiting cognitive radio to mitigate interference in macro/femto heterogeneous networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5876499/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12062894","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On exploiting cognitive radio to mitigate interference in macro/femto heterogeneous networks","sourcePdf":"010CHENGLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046377S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5876489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"5876489","articleId":"5876499","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5876500,"authors":[{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"bio":{"p":["Mugen Peng (pmg@bupt.edu.cn) received his Ph.D. degree from Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunication (BUPT) in 2005.

The underlined HCR-HeNet divides its coverage into three layers: hierarchical cooperative basic layer, homogeneous cooperative enhanced layer, and heterogeneous cooperative extended layer. In the hierarchical cooperative basic layer, highspeed data transmission is enabled using highorder modulation and coding schemes for unicast services, and hierarchical modulation schemes for multicast services. In the homogeneous cooperative enhanced layer, where users may be located near a cell boundary and thus need the help of relay nodes, cooperative homogeneous diversity gain can be achieved. In the heterogeneous cooperative extended layer, heterogeneous cooperative diversity gain guarantees the convergence and interworking of multiradio access networks. The key techniques in the physical and MAC layers are identified. Issues in the application of cognitive radio and self-organized networking techniques in HCR-HeNet are also discussed. Finally, a physical layer testbed for the proposed HCR-HeNet with multicast services is introduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5876489/05876500.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"56","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.5876500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.5876500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical cooperative relay based heterogeneous networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Modulation","Computer architecture","Unicast","Diversity methods","Encoding","Broadband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","diversity reception","modulation","multicast communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous networks","hierarchical cooperative relay-based heterogeneous network HCRHeNet","unicast services","multicast services","hierarchical cooperative relay nodes","cost-effective coverage extension","heterogeneous radio networks","hierarchical cooperative basic layer","homogeneous cooperative enhanced layer","heterogeneous cooperative extended layer","high speed data transmission","high order modulation","coding schemes","hierarchical modulation schemes","cell boundary","cooperative homogeneous diversity gain","heterogeneous cooperative diversity gain","multiradio access networks","physical layers","MAC layers","cognitive radio","self-organized networking techniques","physical layer testbed"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical cooperative relay based heterogeneous networks","volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5876500/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12062895","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical cooperative relay based heterogeneous networks","sourcePdf":"011CHENLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065468S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5876489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"5876489","articleId":"5876500","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5876502,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Lin","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Peng Lin received his B.

At present, some wireless service providers have launched their femtocell services, although there are still plenty of challenges unsettled. In this article we discuss the business mode in macro-femto heterogeneous networks. We propose three frameworks according to the deployment types of femtocells, which are joint deployment, WSP deployment, and user deployment frameworks. Their unique characteristics, corresponding challenges, and potential solutions are further investigated to provide deeper insight systematically. We also present two schemes for WSP revenue maximization under the WSP deployment framework. The first scheme jointly handles the interference and users' demand satisfaction via cross-tier channel allocation, and the second scheme further considers the optimal pricing selection for accessing different networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/5876489/05876502.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2011.5876502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2011.5876502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Macro-femto heterogeneous network deployment and management: from business models to technical solutions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrafast electronics","Interference","Femtocells","Resource management","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","femtocellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["macrofemto heterogeneous network deployment","network management","in-building coverage problem","wireless service providers","femtocell services","WSP revenue maximization","users demand satisfaction","cross-tier channel allocation","optimal pricing selection","business models","technical solutions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Macro-femto heterogeneous network deployment and management: from business models to technical solutions","volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5876502/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12062897","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Macro-femto heterogeneous network deployment and management: from business models to technical solutions","sourcePdf":"013ZHANGLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074288S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"5876489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5876489","articleId":"5876502","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5876503,"authors":[{"name":"Haoming Li","affiliation":["Electrical engineering, University of British Columbia, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Haoming Li [S'08] (hlih@ece.ube.ca) is a Ph.D. candidate in electrical engineering at the University of British Columbia and received his M.

Inertia of the prosthesis plays an important role in natural and smooth gaits during the swing phase. We suppose that goodness of gait is strongly related to effective use of the prosthesis inertia. So far we have proposed the inertia-induced measure as a new method to quantify the effective use of the inertia property of the prosthesis leg in the swing phase based on Riemannian distance. In this paper, we analyzed walking skill with trans-femoral prosthesis leg based on the inertia-induced measure. Gait of a prosthesis leg user was measured at 5th, 8th, and 15th months after amputation. Changes of gait, inertia-induced measure, and subjective evaluation were investigated.","doi":"10.1109/ICCME.2011.5876819","publicationTitle":"The 2011 IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2011 IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871253/5876692/05876819.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCME.2011.5876819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of walking skill with trans-femoral prosthesis based on inertia-induced measure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876819/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of walking skill with trans-femoral prosthesis based on inertia-induced measure","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12070036","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876819/","conferenceDate":"22-25 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of walking skill with trans-femoral prosthesis based on inertia-induced measure","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"CME2011126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092255S","chronDate":"22-25 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871253","isNumber":"5876692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871253","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5876692","articleId":"5876819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5876823,"authors":[{"name":"Xichuan Lin","affiliation":["Kagawa University, Japan"],"firstName":"Xichuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37533752600"},{"name":"Shuxiang Guo","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Shuxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155200"},{"name":"Koujirou Tanaka","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagawa University, Japan"],"firstName":"Koujirou","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37538090200"},{"name":"Seji Hata","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagawa University, Japan"],"firstName":"Seji","lastName":"Hata","id":"37298341000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9323-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9322-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876823","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":436},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a spherical underwater robot","abstract":"This paper presents a spherical underwater robot which uses three vectored water-jet propellers as its propulsion system.

Broadcast, and Surveillance video. Intra-prediction is one of the top 3 compute-intensive processing functions in the H.264/AVC baseline decoder and, therefore, consumes significant number of compute cycles a processor. In this paper, we propose a configurable, high-throughput, and area-efficient hardware design for the intra-prediction unit. The intra-prediction algorithm is optimized to significantly reduce the redundancy in addition operations (e.g., 27% reduction when compared with state-of-the-art in literature). The area requirement for our hardware implementation of the optimized intra-prediction algorithm is further reduced by employing a configurable design to reuse data paths for mutually exclusive processing scenarios. The proposed design is described in VHDL and synthesized under 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS standard cell technology. While working at a clock frequency of 150 MHz, it can easily meet the throughput requirement of HDTV resolutions and consumes only 21K gates.","doi":"10.1109/SIECPC.2011.5876914","publicationTitle":"2011 Saudi International Electronics, Communications and Photonics Conference (SIECPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Saudi International Electronics, Communications and Photonics Conference (SIECPC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783968/5876683/05876914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIECPC.2011.5876914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876683","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient hardware design for intra-prediction in H.264/AVC decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient hardware design for intra-prediction in H.264/AVC decoder","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876914/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12063512","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5876914/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient hardware design for intra-prediction in H.264/AVC decoder","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"siecpc2011submission149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056703S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783968","isNumber":"5876683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783968","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5876683","articleId":"5876914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5876918,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah Alshammary","affiliation":["ECP Program, KACST, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Alshammary","id":"38015958000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0069-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0068-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0067-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5876918","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876918","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","delay lines","discrete Fourier transforms","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency invariant beamforming","sensor delay line","pattern shaping","planar array antenna","array pattern","spatial response variation constraint pattern synthesis","SRVCPS","inverse discrete Fourier transform","IDFT","sidelobe level","processing speed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wideband beamforming","spatial filtering","spatial response variation (SRV)","frequency invariant beam pattern"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIECPC.2011.5876918","publicationTitle":"2011 Saudi International Electronics, Communications and Photonics Conference (SIECPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Saudi International Electronics, Communications and Photonics Conference (SIECPC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783968/5876683/05876918.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIECPC.2011.5876918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency invariant beamforming using sensor delay line","abstract":"Wideband operation and pattern shaping in one dimension can be achieved using a planar array antenna with a real-valued coefficients or weights.

Thus the paper presents the design of an adaptive Viterbi decoder that uses survivor path with parameters for wireless communication in an attempt to reduce the power and cost and at the same time increase the speed. The decoder was simulated using MATLAB 7. In the simulation the BER is calculated and compared with the other models. Furthermore, the system operation under high frequency conditions is also investigated. Next a VHDL description has been adopted to embed the low-power design. The adopted design were coded in VHDL and implemented on a SPARTAN 3. The results show that speed has been increased since the the processing execution time has been reduced by removing the trace back algorithms that is used to find the correct paths. Furthermore, the survivor path decoder is capable of supporting frequency up to 790 MHz for constraint lengths 7, and 9, rate 1/3 and long survivor path is 4. Finally, the cost has been reduced since the different constraint length didn't affect of the complexity of the decoder and the processing time of computing the correct path.","doi":"10.1109/SIECPC.2011.5876958","publicationTitle":"2011 Saudi International Electronics, Communications and Photonics Conference (SIECPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Saudi International Electronics, Communications and Photonics Conference (SIECPC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5783968/5876683/05876958.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIECPC.2011.5876958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of modified architecture for adaptive Viterbi decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5876958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5876958/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of modified architecture for adaptive Viterbi decoder","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12063553","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5876958/","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of modified architecture for adaptive Viterbi decoder","confLoc":"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","sourcePdf":"siecpc2011submission228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050546S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5783968","isNumber":"5876683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5783968","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5876683","articleId":"5876958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5876971,"authors":[{"name":"Mazhar B.

GaN HEMT is considered to be suitable for harmonic tuned high efficiency amplifiers compared with existing GaAs FET amplifiers, due to its high voltage operation and high impedance natures. A high efficiency GaN HEMT amplifier is designed and evaluated, which is equipped with fundamental, second and third harmonic matching circuits in a hermetically sealed metal package. As a result, a high power added efficiency of 70.5% was obtained with associated output power of 7.3W. As the GaN HEMT employed in this work has already passed space qualify tests (SQT), this amplifier will be an important component to realize space solar power systems. Moreover, the module composed of this high efficiency GaN HEMT amplifier supplies the condition for the maximum performance of this amplifier. As a result, a high power added efficiency of 43+/-1% was obtained as a module.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","HEMTs","Power amplifiers","Microwave amplifiers","Power generation","Microwave FETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","power amplifiers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internally-matched HEMT","high efficiency power amplifier","HEMT amplifier","third harmonic matching circuits","second harmonic matching circuits","hermetically sealed metal package","space qualify tests","frequency 5.8 GHz","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solar system","Microwave amplifiers","Microwave circuits","Gallium nitride","Wide band gap semiconductors","HEMTs","Modules"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMWS.2011.5877087","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Innovative Wireless Power Transmission: Technologies, Systems, and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Innovative Wireless Power Transmission: Technologies, Systems, and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871959/5876647/05877087.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS.2011.5877087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internally-matched GaN HEMT high efficiency power amplifier for SPS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5877087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Internally-matched GaN HEMT high efficiency power amplifier for SPS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5877087/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5877087/","accessionNumber":"12070980","conferenceDate":"12-13 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internally-matched GaN HEMT high efficiency power amplifier for SPS","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"IWPT24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055656S","chronDate":"12-13 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871959","isNumber":"5876647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871959","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5876647","articleId":"5877087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5877090,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Chih Lo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Chih","lastName":"Lo","id":"38000136300"},{"name":"Yu-Lin Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Lin","lastName":"Yang","id":"38025918800"},{"name":"Chi-Lin Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Lin","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37961487500"},{"name":"Chieh-Sen Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chieh-Sen","lastName":"Lee","id":"38025756000"},{"name":"Chin-Lung Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Lung","lastName":"Yang","id":"38184040600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-217-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-214-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-216-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-362X"}],"articleNumber":"5877090","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3368},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel wireless impulsive power transmission to enhance the conversion efficiency for low input power","abstract":"This paper applies UWB technologies in a special aspect for the transmission of energy rather than messages to achieve a novel wireless impulsive powering approach and enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for low average input power. The whole impulsive wireless power transmitting and receiving systems are implemented to validate the feasibility of the wireless power transmission (WPT) using impulsive waves and the improvement of the conversion efficiency of the rectifier circuitry. Experimental results prove that this technique is quite suitable for low input power transmission which is good for biomedical applications. In order to deliver the UWB power efficiently, a horn antenna with high directivity, large gain, and broad bandwidth acts as the transmit antenna. The impulsive power generated by the impulse generator is amplified by the UWB power amplifier and then delivered through the horn antenna. And the received impulsive power is converted by the voltage-doubler rectifier composed of Schottky diodes into a direct current (dc) power to supply the chips or rechargeable batteries. In this paper, the UWB impulsive wireless transmission systems have been proved to achieve 50% power conversion efficiency (PCE) even when the input power of the rectifier is lower than 0 dBm. Due to the fact that low transmission power has relatively little impacts and causes relatively slight injury to human bodies, it is one of the essential key technologies in biomedical implant chips and devices.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871959/5876647/05877090.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Workshop Series on Innovative Wireless Power

Several publications have proposed depth down-/up-sampling as part of the depth coding strategy. Recently, we proposed a depth up-sampling method which uses the high resolution view in the process of depth up-sampling. Actually, in 2007 Kopf et.al. already proposed a Joint Bilateral Upsampler(JBU), which uses a high resolution input image as prior in a joint bilateral filter for upscaling. In this paper we compare our previous method with the JBU approach, in the context of depth coding. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of view coding on the depth up-sampling result.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Pixel","Image color analysis","Image resolution","Joints","PSNR","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","filtering theory","image coding","image representation","image resolution","image sampling","three-dimensional television"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth up-sampling method","3DTV","free viewpoint imaging systems","view information","view-plus-depth representation","depth compression","depth coding strategy","joint bilateral upsampler","high resolution input image","joint bilateral filter","JBU approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["depth up-sampling","joint bilateral upsampler","depth coding","free viewpoint television (FTV)","3DTV"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3DTV.2011.5877198","publicationTitle":"2011 3DTV Conference: The True Vision - Capture, Transmission and Display of 3D Video (3DTV-CON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3DTV Conference: The True Vision - Capture, Transmission and Display of 3D Video (3DTV-CON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871444/5877142/05877198.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5877142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DTV.2011.5877198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth up-sampling for depth coding using view information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5877198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Depth up-sampling for depth coding using view information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5877198/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5877198/","accessionNumber":"12070140","conferenceDate":"16-18 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth up-sampling for depth coding using view information","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"p101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046419S","chronDate":"16-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871444","isNumber":"5877142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871444","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5877142","articleId":"5877198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5877202,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey Matyunin","affiliation":["Graphics & Media Laboratory, Moscow State University, Russia"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Matyunin","id":"38016590500"},{"name":"Dmitriy Vatolin","affiliation":["Graphics & Media Laboratory, Moscow State University, Russia"],"firstName":"Dmitriy","lastName":"Vatolin","id":"37658162800"},{"name":"Yury Berdnikov","affiliation":["Graphics & Media Laboratory, Moscow State University, Russia"],"firstName":"Yury","lastName":"Berdnikov","id":"38016474400"},{"name":"Maxim Smirnov","affiliation":["YUVsoft Corporation, Russia"],"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Smirnov","id":"38227679200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-162-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-161-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-160-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-203X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-2021"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-2021"}],"articleNumber":"5877202","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":85,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":4440},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Pixel","Three dimensional displays","Image color analysis","Partitioning algorithms","Robot sensing systems","Motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","filtering theory","image colour analysis","image motion analysis","video cameras","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal filtering","depth maps","Kinect depth camera","depth sensor","depth map temporal stability","digital filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital filters","Image processing","Image enhancement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5877202","abstract":"We propose a method of filtering depth maps provided by Kinect depth camera.

The pair of input stereo images is first decomposed into its low-pass and high-pass views using a motion compensated lifting based wavelet transform. A 2D spatial wavelet transform is then further de-correlates the low-pass view into its sub-bands. Wavelet transform gains are employed to regulate threshold value for different sub-bands. The coefficients in high frequency sub-bands and high-pass view are then hard thresholded to generate their sparse sub-bands and view. The compressive sensing method is then used to generate measurements for different resulting sparse sub-bands and view. The baseband coefficients and measurements are finally losslessly coded. The application of compressive sensing in compressing natural images is in its early stages. Therefore, their performances are usually compared with each other than standard codecs. The performance of the proposed codec is superior to the state of the art and is superior to JPEG subjectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3DTV Conference: The True Vision - Capture, Transmission and Display of 3D Video (3DTV-CON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871444/5877142/05877208.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 3DTV Conference: The True Vision - Capture, Transmission and Display of 3D Video (3DTV-CON)","doi":"10.1109/3DTV.2011.5877208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DTV.2011.5877208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5877142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5877208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereo image representation using compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Compressed sensing","Wavelet transforms","Transform coding","Codecs","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image reconstruction","image representation","motion compensation","stereo image processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereo image representation technique","compressive sensing method","motion compensation","2D spatial wavelet transform","baseband coefficients","natural image compression","standard image codecs","JPEG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Stereo codec","compressive sensing","lifting based wavelet transform","wavelet weights"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5877208/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Stereo image representation using compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5877208/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12070150","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereo image representation using compressive sensing","confLoc":"Antalya, Turkey","sourcePdf":"p117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11071S","chronDate":"16-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871444","isNumber":"5877142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871444","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5877142","articleId":"5877208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"}]
