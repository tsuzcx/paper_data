To learn which one shares more information with the complex model, we show in this paper that the matrices produced by singular value decomposition and QR-decomposition of the complex and new real channel matrices for the complex and new real models, respectively, are fully related. Also, the new real zero-forcing successive interference cancellation (ZF-SIC) detector is shown to find the same solution as the complex ZF-SIC detector. Comparisons of the two real ZF-SIC detectors based on the two real models are therefore equivalent to the comparisons of the complex and conventional real ZF-SIC detectors. Plenty comparisons of the two real ZF-SIC detectors over the Rayleigh fading channel are reported, including the average joint error probability at finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), outage probability at different layers, average error probability at high SNR, and the scenario with optimal transmit power allocation. These comparisons provide much understanding about the complex and two real models as well as their associated detectors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6685967/06661317.pdf","startPage":"6054","endPage":"6066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TW.2013.103113.121600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TW.2013.103113.121600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685967","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparisons of Two Real-Valued MIMO Signal Models and Their Associated ZF-SIC Detectors over the Rayleigh Fading Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Vectors","MIMO","Computational modeling","Fading","Lattices","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","interference suppression","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","signal detection","signal representation","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmit power allocation","outage probability","SNR","finite signal-to-noise ratio","average joint error probability","zero-forcing successive interference cancellation detector","channel matrices","QR-decomposition","singular value decomposition","lattice representation","Rayleigh fading channel","ZF-SIC detectors","real-valued MIMO signal models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system","zero-forcing successive interference cancellation (ZF-SIC) detection","spatially multiplexed MIMO system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Comparisons of Two Real-Valued MIMO Signal Models and Their Associated ZF-SIC Detectors over the Rayleigh Fading Channel","volume":"12","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6661317/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13976983","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparisons of Two Real-Valued MIMO Signal Models and Their Associated ZF-SIC Detectors over the Rayleigh Fading Channel","sourcePdf":"6054-tw1312-tsung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111446S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6685967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6685967","articleId":"6661317","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6661318,"authors":[{"name":"Vo Nguyen Quoc Bao","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6685967/6661318/6661318-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vo Nguyen Quoc Bao received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of Ulsan, South Korea, in 2009.

To deal with this problem, we consider three opportunistic relay selection schemes. The first scheme tries to reduce the overheard information at the eavesdroppers by choosing the relay having the lowest instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to them. The second scheme is conventional selection relaying that seeks the relay having the highest SNR to the destination. In the third scheme, we consider the ratio between the SNR of a relay and the maximum among the corresponding SNRs to the eavesdroppers, and then select the optimal one to forward the signal to the destination. The system performance in terms of probability of non-zero achievable secrecy rate, secrecy outage probability and achievable secrecy rate of the three schemes are analyzed and confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.110813.121671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.110813.121671","startPage":"6076","endPage":"6085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6685967/06661318.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Selection Schemes for Dual-Hop Networks under Security Constraints with Multiple Eavesdroppers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Relay Selection Schemes for Dual-Hop Networks under Security Constraints with Multiple Eavesdroppers","volume":"12","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13976960","publicationDate":"December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6661318/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Selection Schemes for Dual-Hop Networks under Security Constraints with Multiple Eavesdroppers","sourcePdf":"6076-tw1312-bao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073433S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6685967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"6685967","articleId":"6661318","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6661319,"authors":[{"name":"Shree Krishna Sharma","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6685967/6661319/6661319-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shree Krishna Sharma received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, India, in 2004; the M.Sc. degree in information and communication engineering from the Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk, Nepal, in 2010; the M.A. degree in economics from Tribhuvan University Patan Multiple Campus, Patan, Nepal, and the M.Res. degree in computing science from Staffordshire University, Staffordshire, U.K., in 2011.

In practical scenarios, channel and noise may be correlated due to various reasons and SNR estimation techniques with the assumption of white noise and uncorrelated channel may not be suitable for estimating the primary SNR. In this paper, firstly, we study the performance of different eigenvalue-based SS techniques in the presence of channel or/and noise correlation. Secondly, we carry out detailed theoretical analysis of the signal plus noise hypothesis to derive the asymptotic eigenvalue probability distribution function (a.e.p.d.f.) of the received signal's covariance matrix under the following two cases: (i) correlated channel and white noise, and (ii) correlated channel and correlated noise, which is the main contribution of this paper. Finally, an SNR estimation technique based on the derived a.e.p.d.f is proposed in the presence of channel/noise correlation and its performance is evaluated in terms of normalized Mean Square Error (MSE). It is shown that the PU SNR can be reliably estimated when the CR sensing module is aware of the channel/noise correlation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661319/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13976969","htmlLink":"/document/6661319/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"12","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SNR Estimation for Multi-dimensional Cognitive Receiver under Correlated Channel/Noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SNR Estimation for Multi-dimensional Cognitive Receiver under Correlated Channel/Noise","sourcePdf":"6392-tw1312-shree.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115311S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6685967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6685967","articleId":"6661319","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6661325,"authors":[{"name":"Natalia Y.

We study the resource allocation algorithm design for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bits/Joule delivered to the receivers). In particular, we focus on power splitting hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting. Two scenarios are investigated considering different power splitting abilities of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can split the received power into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary power splitting ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can split the received power only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed power splitting ratios. For both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm design as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. By exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the non-convex problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and wireless power transfer: (1) wireless power transfer enhances the system energy efficiency by harvesting energy in the radio frequency, especially in the interference limited regime; (2) the presence of multiple receivers is beneficial for the system capacity, but not necessarily for the system energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.103113.130470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.103113.130470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6685967/06661329.pdf","startPage":"6352","endPage":"6370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Information and Power Transfer: Energy Efficiency Optimization in OFDMA Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Information and Power Transfer: Energy Efficiency Optimization in OFDMA Systems","volume":"12","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6661329/","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13976978","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661329/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Information and Power Transfer: Energy Efficiency Optimization in OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"6352-tw1312-kwan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085244S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6685967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"400","xplore-issue":"6685967","articleId":"6661329","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6661330,"authors":[{"name":"Yaniv George","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6685967/6661330/6661330-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yaniv George received the B.Sc and M.Sc degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Tel Aviv, Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 2002 and 2004 respectively.

However, most works have concentrated on an outage rate model which does not accurately describe the performance of modern communication systems. In this work we consider the ergodic rate density (ERD) of a random ALOHA WANET with a homogenous Poisson point process node distribution. We present two novel lower bounds on the ERD, one for general transmission and reception strategies and the other for receivers with a spatial interference cancellation capability. The bounds are simpler than previously published results for ALOHA WANETs (that have primarily considered the outage rate density). In addition, the bounds and the bounding technique are quite general and enable the derivation of closed form expressions of the ERD for various network models. The efficiency and simplicity of the bounds are demonstrated through several applications, and insights are drawn on the behavior of the network performance as function of the path-loss factor, transmission strategies and number of antennas. Simulation results demonstrate that these simple lower bounds predict the performance of ALOHA WANETs with high accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Ergodic Rate Density of ALOHA Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.110813.130451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6685967/06661330.pdf","startPage":"6340","endPage":"6351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.110813.130451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685967","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"The Ergodic Rate Density of ALOHA Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6661330/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13976949","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Ergodic Rate Density of ALOHA Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"6340-tw1312-yaniv.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6685967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6685967","articleId":"6661330","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6661331,"authors":[{"name":"Hongli Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6685967/6661331/6661331-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongli Xu received his Ph.

Using this mechanism, multiple single-antenna nodes can coordinate their transmissions and receptions so as to reduce power consumption. This paper studies the problem of constructing an energy-efficient topology in wireless sensor networks using vMIMO communication. We first define the problem involving joint optimization of vMIMO, partner selection and topology control. As this problem is NP-Complete, a distributed and heuristic algorithm, called vMIMO topology control (VMTC), is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm uses an improved binary searching method to obtain an initial power assignment. A local competition method is then adopted to implement the partner selection. At last, we reduce the power consumption of each node by using efficient vMIMO modes. Our theoretical analysis show that this algorithm can achieve an approximate performance of O(1). Our simulations show that VMTC helps to decrease the power consumptions by about 32% compared to the existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.110413.130444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6685967/06661331.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.110413.130444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685967","startPage":"6328","endPage":"6339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology Control with vMIMO Communication in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Topology Control with vMIMO Communication in Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661331/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13996521","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6661331/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Control with vMIMO Communication in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"6328-tw1312-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102229S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6685967","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6685967","articleId":"6661331","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6661335,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Javad Abdoli","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd., Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Javad Abdoli (S'09\u2013M'13) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2012.

This paper presents an analysis of both attenuated max-product decoding and weighted min-sum decoding for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which guarantees convergence to a fixed point when a weight factor, \u03b2, is sufficiently small. It also shows that, if the fixed point satisfies some consistency conditions, then it must be both a linear-programming (LP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding solution. For (d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">v</sub>\n, d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n)-regular LDPC codes, the weight factor must satisfy \u03b2(d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">v</sub>\n-1) <; 1 to guarantee convergence to a fixed point, whereas the results proposed by Frey and Koetter require instead that \u03b2(d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">v</sub>\n-1)(d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</sub>\n-1) \u2264 1. In addition, the range of the weight factor for a provable ML decoding solution is extended to 0 <; \u03b2(d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">v</sub>\n-1) 1.

These arrays usually provide a single-channel output, so that no spatial information is available in the output signal. However, spatial information on the sound sources may increase the intelligibility of a speech signal perceived by a human listener. This work presents a mathematical framework for generalized spherical array beamforming that in addition to suppressing noise and reverberation, is aiming to preserve spatial information on the sources in the recording venue. The generalized beamforming, formulated in the spherical harmonics domain, is based on binaural sound reproduction where the head-related transfer functions are incorporated into a headphones presentation. The performance of the proposed generalized beamformer is compared to that of a single-channel output maximum-directivity beamformer. Listening tests with human subjects show that when the generalized beamformer is used the intelligibility is improved at low input SNRs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661358/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","volume":"22","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"13968938","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6661358/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Spherical Array Beamforming for Binaural Speech Reproduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Spherical Array Beamforming for Binaural Speech Reproduction","sourcePdf":"taslp-shabtai-2290499-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105705S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6663728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6663728","articleId":"6661358","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6661359,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, School of Electrical Engineering, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jun Yang is currently pursuing the Doctoral degree with the School of Electrical Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China.

Collaborative in-network processing among multiple nodes is essential when executing such a task due to the strictly constrained energy and resources in single node. Task allocation is essential to allocate the workload of each task to proper nodes in an efficient manner. In this paper, a modified version of binary particle swarm optimization (MBPSO), which adopts a different transfer function and a new position updating procedure with mutation, is proposed for the task allocation problem to obtain the best solution. Each particle in MBPSO is encoded to represent a complete potential solution for task allocation. The task workload and connectivity are ensured by taking them as constraints for the problem. Multiple metrics, including task execution time, energy consumption, and network lifetime, are considered a whole by designing a hybrid fitness function to achieve the best overall performance. Simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed MBPSO-based approach for task allocation problem in WSN. The proposed MBPSO-based approach also outperforms the approaches based on genetic algorithm and BPSO in the comparative analysis.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6704724/06661359.pdf","startPage":"882","endPage":"892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task Allocation for Wireless Sensor Network Using Modified Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2290433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2290433","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Task Allocation for Wireless Sensor Network Using Modified Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14055204","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6661359/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task Allocation for Wireless Sensor Network Using Modified Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"jsen-zhang-2290433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097898S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6704724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6704724","articleId":"6661359","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6661363,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhuo Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Vic., Australia"],"firstName":"Yizhuo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37310959600"},{"name":"Christina Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Vic., Australia"],"firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Lim","id":"37279826900"},{"name":"Ampalavanapillai Nirmalathas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Vic., Australia"],"firstName":"Ampalavanapillai","lastName":"Nirmalathas","id":"37270057800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"6661363","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":794},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical fibers","Optical distortion","Radio frequency","Optical fiber communication","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","optical links","radio-over-fibre"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband OFDM transmission","fibre-wireless links","high-frequency broadband OFDM signals","analog RoF","RF-OFDM signal","BS/RRH","inter-modulation distortion","IMD","RF power fading","digitized RoF transport scheme","bandpass sampling","digital optical link","signal clipping","ADC","fibre-wireless integration system","broadband RF-OFDM transmission","short-range transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband OFDM","fibre-wireless integration","RF digitization","radio-over-fibre"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the different transport schemes for delivery of high-frequency broadband OFDM signals via fibre-wireless links. We have investigated analog RoF, digitized RoF, and sampled RoF transport schemes and experimentally demonstrated the transmission of broadband RF-OFDM signal using these schemes. Analog RoF results in the simplest BS/RRH configuration but it demands for large optical bandwidth. The performance of this transport scheme is limited by inter-modulation distortion (IMD) and RF power fading. For the digitized RoF transport scheme based on bandpass sampling, although digital optical link is used for signal delivery, the performance is limited by signal clipping and ADC resolution. The sampled RoF transport scheme requires only a narrow optical bandwidth, but the performance is limited by IMD and noise processes introduced by bandpass sampling. Based on our analysis and experimental results, a design guide of fibre-wireless integration system for broadband RF-OFDM transmission is provided. It is found that: analog RoF is best suitable for short-range transmission; digitized RoF has the best performance; and sampled RoF offers a low-cost solution.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2290295","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6678720/06661363.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2290295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6678720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation on Transport Schemes for Efficient High-Frequency Broadband OFDM Transmission in Fibre-Wireless Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661363/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation on Transport Schemes for Efficient High-Frequency Broadband OFDM Transmission in Fibre-Wireless Links","volume":"32","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"13969440","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6661363/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation on Transport Schemes for Efficient High-Frequency Broadband OFDM Transmission in Fibre-Wireless Links","sourcePdf":"jlt-yang-2290295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068304S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6678720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6678720","articleId":"6661363","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6661372,"authors":[{"name":"Huai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/6728629/6661372/6661372-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huai Wang (S'07\u2013M'12) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2012.","He has been with Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, since 2012, where he is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Energy Technology.

PCG has seldom been deployed for generating entire game levels, a notable exception to this being dungeons: a specific type of game level often encountered in adventure and role playing games. Due to their peculiar combination of pace, gameplay, and game spaces, dungeon levels are among the most suited to showcase the benefits of PCG. This paper surveys research on procedural methods to generate dungeon game levels. We summarize common practices, discuss pros and cons of different approaches, and identify a few promising challenges ahead. In general, what current procedural dungeon generation methods are missing is not performance, but more powerful, accurate, and richer control over the generation process. Recent research results seem to indicate that gameplay-related criteria can provide this high-level control. However, this area is still in its infancy, and many research challenges still lie ahead, e.g., improving the intuitiveness and accessibility of such methods for designers. We also observe that more research is needed into generic mechanisms for automating the generation of the actual dungeon-geometric models. We conclude that the foundations for enabling gameplay-based control of dungeon-level generation are worth being researched, and that its promising results may be instrumental in bringing PCG into mainstream game development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661386/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6661386/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14159290","volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Procedural Generation of Dungeons","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Procedural Generation of Dungeons","sourcePdf":"tciaig-lopes-2290371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064294S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"6766678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6766678","articleId":"6661386","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6661389,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Meyer","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Meyer","id":"38469615800"},{"name":"Ondrej Hlinka","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Hlinka","id":"37646081200"},{"name":"Franz Hlawatsch","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Hlawatsch","id":"37285048000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6661389","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1059},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661389","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Covariance matrices","Bayes methods","Belief propagation","Kalman filters","Vectors","Message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","particle filtering (numerical methods)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sigma point belief propagation","SP filter","unscented Kalman filter","extended Kalman filter","particle filter","nonsequential Bayesian inference","loopy factor graphs","SPBP","low-complexity approximation","belief propagation message passing scheme","BP message passing scheme","posterior distribution marginalization","loopy factor graph","decentralized inference","decentralized dynamic sensor localization problem","nonparametric BP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Belief propagation","cooperative localization","factor graph","sigma points","unscented transformation"]}],"abstract":"The sigma point (SP) filter, also known as unscented Kalman filter, is an attractive alternative to the extended Kalman filter and the particle filter.

A major advantage of the proposed controller is emulating the behavior of synchronous machines (SMs) with proper regulation of dc-link voltage which eases integration of VSCs interfacing distributed and renewable generation units into ac systems in the presence of conventional SMs. A cascaded frequency, angle and virtual torque control topology is developed to emulate the mechanical behavior of an SM which offers synchronization power to eliminate the need for a phase-locked-loop after initial converter synchronization, and damping power dynamics to damp power oscillations; and presents frequency dynamics similar to SMs, thus it introduces some inertia to the grid. The controller presents high stability margin and fast dc-link voltage regulation, whereas it can provide frequency support in the ac-side during contingencies. Frequency and voltage amplitude are adjusted by two separate loops. Two different variants are proposed for dc-link voltage control; namely direct dc-link voltage control and indirect dc-link voltage control via a dc-link voltage controller. Small-signal dynamics, analysis, and design process are presented. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the controller effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2287291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2287291","startPage":"943","endPage":"957","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6740879/06661424.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Comprehensive Control Framework for Incorporating VSCs to Smart Power Grids Using Bidirectional Synchronous-VSC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Novel Comprehensive Control Framework for Incorporating VSCs to Smart Power Grids Using Bidirectional Synchronous-VSC","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14111731","publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6661424/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Comprehensive Control Framework for Incorporating VSCs to Smart Power Grids Using Bidirectional Synchronous-VSC","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ashabani-2287291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079997S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6740879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"6740879","articleId":"6661424","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6661429,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Assuming that both the MS and Pan images have the same sparseness, a close approximation to the MS image is obtained from the Pan image using the theory of compressive sensing and l1 minimization. We then use regularization framework to obtain fused image. The low resolution (LR) MS image is modeled as degraded and noisy version of fused image in which degradation matrix entires estimated using the close approximation are used. The regularization is carried out by using truncated quadratic smoothness prior which takes care of preservation of the discontinuities in the fused image. A suitable energy function is then formed consisting of data fitting term and prior term. Minimization of the energy function is carried out using a computationally efficient graph cuts optimization to obtain final fused image. Advantage of our approach is that the Pan and MS images need not be registered. This is because, we are not directly using the Pan digital numbers to derive the fused image. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by conducting experiments on real satellite images. Subjective and quantitative comparison of the proposed method with the state-of-the-art approaches indicates efficacy of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2287891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6834838/06661429.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2287891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6834838","startPage":"1771","endPage":"1780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresolution Image Fusion: Use of Compressive Sensing and Graph Cuts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiresolution Image Fusion: Use of Compressive Sensing and Graph Cuts","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14379601","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6661429/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresolution Image Fusion: Use of Compressive Sensing and Graph Cuts","sourcePdf":"jstars-gajjar-2287891-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091863S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6834838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6834838","articleId":"6661429","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6661455,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

The modular multilevel cascaded converters have been deemed as strong contenders for the development of medium-voltage converters, but the converters require multiple isolated and balanced dc supplies. In this paper, a high-frequency link multilevel cascaded medium-voltage converter is proposed. The common high-frequency link generates multiple isolated and balanced dc supplies for the converter, which inherently minimizes the voltage imbalance and common mode issues. An 11-kV system is designed and analyzed taking into account the specified system performance, control complexity, cost, and market availability of the power semiconductors. To verify the feasibility of the proposed system, a scaled down 1.73-kVA laboratory prototype test platform with a modular five-level cascaded converter is developed and explored in this paper, which converts a 210 V dc (rectified generator voltage) into three-phase 1 kV rms 50 Hz ac. The experimental results are analyzed and discussed. It is expected that the proposed new technology will have great potential for future renewable generation systems and smart grid applications.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2290313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2290313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778795","startPage":"4167","endPage":"4182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6778795/06661455.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661455","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Medium voltage","Generators","Windings","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency convertors","power semiconductor devices","power transformers","renewable energy sources","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-frequency link medium-voltage converter","direct grid integration","renewable energy systems","step-up transformers","renewable power generation systems","modular multilevel cascaded converters","multiple isolated dc supplies","balanced dc supplies","dc control complexity","market availability","solid-state semiconductors","power semiconductors","five-level converter","rectified generator voltage","smart grid applications","apparent power 1.73 kVA","voltage 6 kV to 36 kV","voltage 1 kV","voltage 210 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct grid integration","high-frequency link","medium-voltage converters","modular multilevel cascaded (MMC) converters","renewable energy systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A High-Frequency Link Multilevel Cascaded Medium-Voltage Converter for Direct Grid Integration of Renewable Energy Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14196426","dateOfInsertion":"26 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6661455/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661455/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Frequency Link Multilevel Cascaded Medium-Voltage Converter for Direct Grid Integration of Renewable Energy Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-islam-2290313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119222S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6778795","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"6778795","articleId":"6661455","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6661456,"authors":[{"name":"Melpomeni Kalofonou","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6863720/6661456/6661456-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Melpomeni Kalofonou (S'10) received the Dipl.Eng. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Patras, Patras, Greece, and the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2007 and 2009, respectively.","Currently, she is working toward the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering at the Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London.

The fabricated system, with only a few transistors, achieves differential measurements and therefore drift minimisation of continuously recorded pH signals obtained from biochemical reactions such as DNA amplification in addition to combined gain tunability using only a single current. Experimental results are presented, demonstrating the capabilities of the front-end at a microscopic level through integration in a lab-on-chip (LoC) setup combining a microfluidic assembly, suitable for applications that require differential monitoring in small volumes, such as DNA detection where more than one gene needs to be studied. The system was designed and fabricated in a typical 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS process with the resulting topology achieving good differential pH sensitivity with a measured low power consumption of only 165 nW due to weak inversion operation. A tunable gain is demonstrated with results confirming 15.56 dB gain at 20 nA of ISFET bias current and drift reduction of up to 100 times compared to a single-ended measurement is also reported due to the differential current output, making it ideal for robust, low-power chemical measurement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Power Sub--W Chemical Gilbert Cell for ISFET Differential Reaction Monitoring","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2013.2282894","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/6863720/06661456.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2013.2282894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6863720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Low Power Sub-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>W Chemical Gilbert Cell for ISFET Differential Reaction Monitoring","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6661456/","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14481506","pubMedId":"24240008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Power Sub-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>W Chemical Gilbert Cell for ISFET Differential Reaction Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tbcas-kalofonou-2282894-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09893S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"6863720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6863720","articleId":"6661456","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6661459,"authors":[{"name":"Ibraheem Al-Naib","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy, Kingston, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/6666060/6661459/6661459-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ibraheem Al-Naib (S'06\u2013GSM'08\u2013M'09) was born in Mosul, Iraq.

The skin effect is modeled by imposing the surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC) to the surface of the conductor, which significantly reduces the computational effort. Two methods of applying SIBC are proposed and discussed in detail. A procedure for transferring the time-domain convolution into Laguerre domain in recursive form is also discussed. In addition, a method for embedding and de-embedding port resistors for fast simulation and accurate extraction of frequency-domain response is proposed. The results have been validated using measurements, along with the stability analysis of the two implementation methods. Simulation results from the multiscale structures are presented and are compared with measurements which show good accuracy and improved computational efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6677544/06661466.pdf","startPage":"4029","endPage":"4039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2287475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2287475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skin-Effect-Incorporated Transient Simulation Using the Laguerre-FDTD Scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductors","Magnetic domains","Time-domain analysis","Surface impedance","Computational modeling","Skin effect","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","frequency response","frequency-domain analysis","stochastic processes","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skin effect incorporated transient simulation","Laguerre FDTD scheme","Laguerre finite difference time domain method","multiscale structures","surface impedance boundary condition","SIBC","time domain convolution","Laguerre domain","recursive form","deembedding port resistors","frequency domain response","stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Laguerre finite-difference time-domain (Laugerre-FDTD)","skin effect","surface impedance boundary condition (SIBC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Skin-Effect-Incorporated Transient Simulation Using the Laguerre-FDTD Scheme","volume":"61","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6661466/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13933809","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skin-Effect-Incorporated Transient Simulation Using the Laguerre-FDTD Scheme","sourcePdf":"tmtt-yi-2287475-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07585S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6677544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6677544","articleId":"6661466","onlineDate":"11 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6661513,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Burgio","affiliation":["Universite de Bretagne-Sud, Lorient, FR"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Burgio"},{"name":"Andrea Marongiu","affiliation":["Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, IT"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Marongiu"},{"name":"Robin Danilo","affiliation":["Universite de Bretagne-Sud, Lorient, FR"],"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Danilo"},{"name":"Philippe Coussy","affiliation":["Universite de Bretagne-Sud, Lorient, FR"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Coussy"},{"name":"Luca Benini","affiliation":["Universita di Bologna, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna, IT"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Benini"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"979-10-92279-01-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6661513","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Couplings","Reactive power","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared memory systems","workstation clusters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application development","acceleration capabilities standardization","heterogeneous shared memory cluster","system complexity","programming model","heterogeneous computing","modern computer vision","image processing","embedded systems","hardware acceleration","parallel architectures","tightly-coupled shared-memory clusters","energy efficiency targets","shared memory processor-to-accelerator communication","code offloading","HW IP","critical computational kernels"]}],"abstract":"Modern computer vision and image processing embedded systems exploit hardware acceleration inside scalable parallel architectures, such as tightly-coupled clusters, to achieve stringent performance and energy efficiency targets. Architectural heterogeneity typically makes software development cumbersome, thus shared memory processor-to-accelerator communication is typically preferred to simplify code offloading to HW IPs for critical computational kernels. However, tightly coupling a large number of accelerators and processors in a shared memory cluster is a challenging task, since the complexity of the resulting system quickly becomes too large. We tackle these issues by proposing a template of heterogeneous shared memory cluster which scales to a large number of accelerators, achieving up to 40% better performance/area/watt than simply designing larger main interconnects to accommodate several HW IPs. In addition, following a trend towards standardization of acceleration capabilities of future embedded systems, we develop a programming model which simplifies application development for heterogeneous clusters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture and programming model support for efficient heterogeneous computing on tigthly-coupled shared-memory clusters","publicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653325/6661501/06661513.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Architecture and programming model support for efficient heterogeneous computing on tigthly-coupled shared-memory clusters","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899429","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture and programming model support for efficient heterogeneous computing on tigthly-coupled shared-memory clusters","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"0022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056711S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","isNumber":"6661501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653325","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6661513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6661514,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Rodriguez","affiliation":["ETIS Lab UMR 8051 CNRS / ENSEA / UCP, 6 Avenue du Ponceau, 95000 Cergy-Pontoise, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Rodriguez"},{"name":"Laurent Fiack","affiliation":["ETIS Lab UMR 8051 CNRS / ENSEA / UCP, 6 Avenue du Ponceau, 95000 Cergy-Pontoise, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Fiack"},{"name":"Beno\u00eet Miramond","affiliation":["ETIS Lab UMR 8051 CNRS / ENSEA / UCP, 6 Avenue du Ponceau, 95000 Cergy-Pontoise, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Beno\u00eet","lastName":"Miramond"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"979-10-92279-01-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6661514","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Neurons","Hardware","Feature extraction","Vectors","Computational modeling","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology","computer vision","multiprocessing systems","neural nets","parallel architectures","plasticity","resource allocation","self-adjusting systems","substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","self-organizing behaviors","neural fields equations","distributed hardware artificial neural network","robot","neurocognitive processes","hardware controller","bio-inspired hardware substrate","distributed load-balancing","processing cores","dynamically partitioning application tasks","neurosciences","biology","classical computation model","massively parallel many-core architectures","artificial vision systems","hardware plasticity","neural model"]}],"abstract":"The advent of massively parallel many-core architectures on a chip can be considered as a good opportunity to rethink the classical computation model used for several decades and that now shows some limitations to follow both the potential and the usage of new technologies. In this paper, the way explored to study new solutions is directly inspired from biology, and more precisely from neurosciences. This way could lead, for example, to best practices for dynamically partitioning application tasks onto a set of processing cores. Distributed load-balancing is known to bring more efficient utilization of resources in the case of regular applications. We propose in this paper a bio-inspired hardware substrate that brings a plasticity property into many-core architectures. We describe a hardware controller in which a grid of processing elements will support a set of neurocognitive processes in order to drive a robot in different tasks. We propose an original distributed hardware artificial neural network as support for this plasticity. It is inspired by Neural Fields equations that have shown self-organizing behaviors and can be suitable for this purpose. It can be used to take allocation decisions locally, taking into account the state of the whole system through the emergent behaviour of the network.

On the one hand, these algorithms are typically computationally demanding, on the other hand, they are often used in embedded systems, which have stringent constraints on, e. g., size or power. In this work, we present the benefits of mapping compute-intensive imaging algorithms on programmable massively parallel processor arrays. More specific, we propose different variants of a combined corner and edge detection algorithm, the Harris Corner Detector (HCD), map these variants onto tightly-coupled processor arrays (TCPAs), and prototype the TCPA architecture, executing the different HCD implementations, in FPGA technology. Because floating-point operations are very costly in FPGAs, we use fixed-point arithmetic in our design, and evaluate our implementation by means of accuracy and performance against two state-of-the-art implementations: (a) the OpenCV library of programming functions for real-time computer vision, using 64-bit floating-point precision, and (b) a 32-bit fixed-point DSP-based embedded system. The accuracy of our work is evaluated by considering the number of corners detected. Here, our approach achieves an average error of less than 1.5% when compared with a reference implementation. Our different variants, trading accuracy for performance, are mapped to the programmable processor elements of a TCPA. Here, the fastest TCPA implementation achieves a 55 times higher frame rate than a state-of-the-art implementation of the HCD on a digital signal processor. Finally, we show how our implementation can be used in the context of a new resource-aware parallel computing paradigm, called invasive computing. Here, an application can adapt itself at run-time in order to satisfy different quality and throughput requirements.","publicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653325/6661501/06661523.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accuracy and performance analysis of Harris Corner computation on tightly-coupled processor arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661523/","displayDocTitle":"Accuracy and performance analysis of Harris Corner computation on tightly-coupled processor arrays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899417","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accuracy and performance analysis of Harris Corner computation on tightly-coupled processor arrays","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"0088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035729S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","isNumber":"6661501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653325","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6661523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6661534,"authors":[{"name":"Mateusz Komorkiewicz","affiliation":["Akademia Gorniczo-Hutnicza imienia Stanislawa Staszica w Krakowie, Krakow, Wojew\u00c3\u00b3dztwo ma\u00c5\u201aopolskie, PL"],"firstName":"Mateusz","lastName":"Komorkiewicz"},{"name":"Marek Gorgon","affiliation":["Akademia Gorniczo-Hutnicza imienia Stanislawa Staszica w Krakowie, Krakow, Wojew\u00c3\u00b3dztwo ma\u00c5\u201aopolskie, PL"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Gorgon"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"979-10-92279-01-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6661534","dbTime":"46 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Context","Image segmentation","Equations","Symmetric matrices","Labeling","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","image segmentation","image sequences","image texture","matrix algebra","object detection","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["foreground object feature extraction","GLCM texture descriptor","2D scene feature extraction","object detection method","background subtraction","optical-flow thresholding","labeled segment","pipelined approach","FPGA based system","single pass connected components analysis module","gray level cooccurrence matrix","texture descriptor computation block","external memory access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","feature extraction","GLCM","Haralick features","texture descriptor","real-time","image processing"]}],"abstract":"Texture descriptors are a powerful tool for 2D scene features extraction.

This paper discusses two new 3D stacked architectures for burst high speed imaging with in-situ A/D conversion, one with analog memories, the other based on digital storage. We propose appraisals of frame-rate, memory depth and power consumption for both architectures. Thanks to this assessment, analog storage architecture appears as a good way to reach unmatched speed performances (>10Terapixel/s) while digital storage architecture seems an interesting solution to reach high memory depth (>200 frames). Moreover, this study identifies a very high power consumption of the digital and analog storage architectures during the image capture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New 3D-integrated burst image sensor architectures with in-situ A/D conversion","publicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653325/6661501/06661545.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"New 3D-integrated burst image sensor architectures with in-situ A/D conversion","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6661545/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899450","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New 3D-integrated burst image sensor architectures with in-situ A/D conversion","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"0215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093523S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653325","isNumber":"6661501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653325","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6661501","articleId":"6661545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Electronic Chips & Systems design Initiative - ECSI","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6661546,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Schumacher","affiliation":["Merses Center for Applied Research, Pforzheim University, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Schumacher"},{"name":"Thomas Greiner","affiliation":["Merses Center for Applied Research, Pforzheim University, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Greiner"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"979-10-92279-01-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6661546","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Vectors","Pipelines","Transforms","Shape","Computer architecture","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Hough transforms","parallel architectures","pipeline processing","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA architecture","generalized Hough transform","real-time stereo correspondence","GHT","image processing method","arbitrary shaped image determination","Hough voting scheme","hardware implementation","processing regularity","data storage requirements","pipelining","raster scan architecture","image processing blocks","data throughput","latency","resource utilization","disparity information calculation performance","real world benchmark datasets","hardware architecture","speed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","Stereo vision","Hardware architecture","Real-time systems","Feature extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661546","abstract":"The Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) is a widely known image processing method to find arbitrary shapes in images.

A modern channelizer uses advantages of polyphase filter banks to process multiple channels at the same time, allowing down conversion, downsampling, and filtering all at the same time. However, due to limitations imposed by the structure and requirements of channelizers, their usage is limited and poses significant challenges due to inflexibility using conventional implementation techniques, which are intensively hardware-based. However, with advances in graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, we now have the potential to deliver high computational throughput along with the flexibility of software-based implementation. In this paper, we demonstrate how this potential can be exploited by presenting a novel GPU-based channelizer implementation. Our implementation incorporates methods for eliminating complex buffer managements and performing arbitrary resampling on all channels simultaneously. We also introduce the notion of simultaneously processing many channels as a high data rate parallel receiver system using blocks of threads in the GPU. The multi-channel, flexible, high-throughput, and arbitrary resampling characteristics of our GPU-based channelizer make it attractive for a variety of communication receiver applications.","startPage":"231","endPage":"238","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653325/6661501/06661548.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient GPU implementation of an arbitrary resampling polyphase channelizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An efficient GPU implementation of an arbitrary resampling polyphase channelizer","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6661548/","accessionNumber":"13899448","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661548/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient GPU implementation of an arbitrary resampling polyphase channelizer","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"0231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070598S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653325","isNumber":"6661501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653325","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6661501","articleId":"6661548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Electronic Chips & Systems design Initiative - ECSI","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6661550,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Airoldi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Airoldi","id":"37589418900"},{"name":"Jari Nurmi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Nurmi","id":"37274976400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"979-10-92279-01-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6661550","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Synchronization","Algorithm design and analysis","Correlation","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","digital signal processing chips","energy consumption","filtering theory","software radio","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filter design","timing synchronization","receiver architectures","signal-to-noise ratio level","SNR level","DSP-like core","digital signal processor","computation time metric","energy consumption metric","computation time reduction","energy reduction","flexible radios","software defined radio","W-CDMA receivers","wireless code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["software defined radios","timing synchronization","matched filters","W-CDMA"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a matched filter for timing synchronization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661550","startPage":"247","endPage":"251","publicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653325/6661501/06661550.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661501","abstract":"This paper presents the design and evaluation of two algorithms for the implementation of a matched filter for timing synchronization in receiver architectures.

The advantage of speed using GPU advocates our system for practical applications such as aerial reconnaissance, cartography, robotic navigation and obstacle detection.","publicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653325/6661501/06661552.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3D reconstruction from real-time stereoscopic images using GPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661552/","displayDocTitle":"A 3D reconstruction from real-time stereoscopic images using GPU","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899440","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3D reconstruction from real-time stereoscopic images using GPU","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"0253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03937S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","isNumber":"6661501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653325","articleId":"6661552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6661555,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhui Bai","affiliation":["Universite de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Yuhui","lastName":"Bai"},{"name":"Syed-Zahid Ahmed","affiliation":["Universite de Cergy-Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Syed-Zahid","lastName":"Ahmed"},{"name":"Bertrand Granado","affiliation":["Sorbonne Universite Campus Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"firstName":"Bertrand","lastName":"Granado"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"979-10-92279-01-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6661555","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"abstract":"Hierarchical Enumerative Coding (HENUC) is a lossless compression algorithm used in a wavelet based image encoder. By manipulating the wavelet coefficients into locally stationary sequences, HENUC is demonstrated to provide good compression efficiency according to our experimental results. We extended our previous work on FPGA encoder SoC, exploiting an innovative on-chip memory access manner in the bit-plane coding using dual port, as well as an address-based data traversal technique during the coding. Performance results are based on the Altera's 40nm Stratix IV EP4SGX230 FPGA, on a DE4 board from Terasic, where the optimized dual port HENUC architecture is implemented in a Nios II processor based system on chip. We present the resource utilization and the execution time evaluations. We show that our implementation at 100MHz can provide around 10X speedup over 2.4GHz Intel Xeon 8-core CPU, which is about twice as faster as our previous result.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653325/6661501/06661555.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"278","publicationTitle":"2013 Conference on Design and Architectures for Signal and Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of an FPGA based encoder SoC for locally stationary image source","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Image coding","Ports (Computers)","Field programmable gate arrays","Indexes","Vectors","System-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","data compression","field programmable gate arrays","image coding","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based encoder SoC","locally stationary image source","hierarchical enumerative coding","lossless compression algorithm","wavelet coefficients","compression efficiency","innovative on-chip memory access","bit-plane coding","dual port","address-based data traversal technique","Altera","Stratix IV EP4SGX230 FPGA","DE4 board","Terasic","optimized dual port HENUC architecture","Nios II processor based system on chip","resource utilization","execution time evaluations","Intel Xeon 8-core CPU","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hierarchical enumerative coding","image compression","embedded system","FPGA","SoC","locally stationary source"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of an FPGA based encoder SoC for locally stationary image source","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899426","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of an FPGA based encoder SoC for locally stationary image source","confLoc":"Cagliari, Italy","sourcePdf":"0271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069778S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","isNumber":"6661501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653325","articleId":"6661555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6661573,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Congiu","affiliation":["DIEE - Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Congiu","id":"37074490700"},{"name":"Massimo Barbaro","affiliation":["DIEE - Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Barbaro","id":"37372540800"},{"name":"Andrea Picciau","affiliation":["DIEE - Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Picciau","id":"37074659700"},{"name":"Emanuele Bodano","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Villach, Austria"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Bodano","id":"37542465700"},{"name":"Dirk Hammerschmidt","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Villach, Austria"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Hammerschmidt","id":"37296164900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"979-10-92279-01-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6661573","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661573","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Silicon","Digital control","Power electronics","Steady-state","Power supplies","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","DC-DC power convertors","delta-sigma modulation","digital control","field programmable gate arrays","perturbation techniques","quantisation (signal)","self-adjusting systems","switched mode power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steady-state load identification technique","digitally controlled DC-DC power supply","selftuning technique","digitally controlled switching mode power supply","SMPS","perturbations","load information","power supply output filter","closed loop condition","closed-loop system","quantization noise","low-resolution delta-sigma modulator","\u0394\u03a3 modulator","digital control","PSD computation","extraction-regulation blocks","Virtex6 FPGA","analog blocks","buck converter","ADC","test chip","control loop configuration"]}],"abstract":"This demo will show a novel method of Selftuning technique suitable for digitally controlled Switching Mode Power Supplies (SMPS).

Photonics allow broad regions of the spectrum to be covered with a single link.

RF-over-fiber enables heavy stove-piped RF cabling tied to specific frequencies to be replaced by lightweight fiber that can be used for any RF frequency. Integrated photonics technology can provide the ultra stable oscillators needed for future systems, enabling today's specialized laboratory-only equipment to fielded in future systems. Photonic mixing and switching technology enables apertures to be used for multifunctions (like RADAR and communications) without having to change the \u201cboxes\u201d generating and processing the signals. RF photonic technology can enable broadly tunable receivers and transmitters that can provide wide instantaneous bandwidth (BW) anywhere over broad ranges of spectrum with a single receiver.

Thermal comfort depends on the combination of various physical quantities, such as temperature, humidity, density of people and air flow speed. Usually, most of commercial solutions measure only temperature and humidity in a single location of the room. However, better results can be achieved if distributed measurements are performed using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The WSN described in this paper consists of nodes that are equipped not only with basic temperature and humidity sensors, but also with two further types of transducers measuring the air flow speed and the radiant temperature, respectively, thus greatly improving thermal comfort estimation accuracy. In the following, the WSN architecture and the performance of the sensors used on each WSN node are analyzed in detail.

The distinctive feature of these systems is a high real performance and low power consumption, high-speed interfaces, and practically linear growth of the performance when hardware resource is expanding. The use of an application development system software suit for reconfigurable computer systems is viewed.

Previous literature has pointed to the role of trust and control to mitigate the risks associated with the adoption of the cloud. However, there is a paucity of research on how the combination of different types of trust with formal control can mitigate the risk of cloud adoption involving highly confidential data. This paper improves our understanding of this issue by applying a framework adopted from the strategic alliance literature. Drawing on a case study of a Children's charity, this paper demonstrates how control and trust building helped the charity to mitigate the risk of adopting cloud computing involving highly sensitive and confidential data.

Trends in cloud deployment, operation and management to date have not been guided by any regulatory standards, and resources have been deployed in an ad hoc manner as demanded according to the business objectives of service providers. This is the least costly and most quickly revenue-returning business model. It is not however, the most cost-effective approach on a long-term basis: As a consequence of this roll-out model to date, the interoperability of resources deployed across clouds managed by different operators is restricted through inability to allocate workload to them in a regulated and controllable manner. The absence of standardised approaches to cloud management is therefore beginning to be accommodated such that the cost and performance advantages of interoperable operation may be exploited. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in standards across the field and trends in their development. We present a model which defines the drivers for cloud interoperability and constraints which restrict the extent to which this may realistically occur in future scalable solutions. This is supplemented with discussion on future challenges foreseen with regard to cloud operation and the way in which standards require provision such that cloud interoperation may be accommodated.","publicationTitle":"2013 Science and Information Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Science and Information Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653326/6661709/06661849.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661709","startPage":"902","endPage":"911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The standardisation of cloud computing: Trends in the state-of-the-art and management issues for the next generation of cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The standardisation of cloud computing: Trends in the state-of-the-art and management issues for the next generation of cloud","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661849/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899578","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6661849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The standardisation of cloud computing: Trends in the state-of-the-art and management issues for the next generation of cloud","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"Paper137TheStandardisationofCloudCom.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095341S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653326","isNumber":"6661709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653326","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6661709","articleId":"6661849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Science and Information Organization","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6661855,"authors":[{"name":"Mariachiara Puviani","affiliation":["University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy"],"firstName":"Mariachiara","lastName":"Puviani","id":"37659485500"},{"name":"Regina Frei","affiliation":["University of Durham, Durham, UK"],"firstName":"Regina","lastName":"Frei","id":"37601302600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9893193-0-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6661855","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Peer-to-peer computing","Computational modeling","Servers","Feedback loop","Cameras","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","P2P structure","peer-to-peer structure","partial blackout scenario","self-management property","temporary centralised structure","design pattern","self-adaptive property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","self-management","design patterns"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is an emergent technology in the process of becoming ubiquitous.

A simple MIMO-DCSK communication scheme based on orthogonal multi-codes (OMCs) and equal gain combination (EGC) is proposed, in which OMCs are used to spread the same information bit at each transmitting antenna and the information bit is detected by EGC at receiving antenna. The OMCs are constructed from one chaotic sequence by means of othogo-nal space-time block coding (OSTBC). The output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after EGC is given based on central limit theory (CLT), and it can effectively exploit the spatial diversity of the underlying MIMO system.

In the network, FOG temperature and its gradient are set as input and the FOG bias drift is set as the expected output. A 2-5-1 network trained with IUKF algorithm is established. The IUKF algorithm is developed on the basis of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The weight and bias vectors of the hidden layer are set as the state of the UKF and its process and measurement equations are deduced according to the network architecture. To solve the unavoidable estimation deviation of the mean and covariance of the states in the UKF algorithm, iterative computation is introduced into the UKF after the measurement update. While the measurement noise R is extended into the state vectors before iteration in order to meet the statistic orthogonality of estimate and measurement noise. The IUKF algorithm can provide the optimized estimation for the neural network because of its state expansion and iteration. Temperature rise (-20-20\u00b0C) and drop (70-20\u00b0C) tests for FOG are carried out in an attemperator. The temperature drift model is built with neural network, and it is trained respectively with BP, UKF and IUKF algorithms. The results prove that the proposed model has higher precision compared with the back-propagation (BP) and UKF network models.","doi":"10.1109/JSEE.2013.00097","startPage":"838","endPage":"844","publicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEE.2013.00097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661863","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971804/6661863/06661878.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IUKF neural network modeling for FOG temperature drift","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"BIAI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661878/","displayDocTitle":"IUKF neural network modeling for FOG temperature drift","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 November 2013","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"IUKF neural network modeling for FOG temperature drift","sourcePdf":"838844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023477S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","isNumber":"6661863","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971804","citationCount":"7","articleId":"6661878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"BIAI","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6661900,"authors":[{"name":"Colin O'Reilly","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research University of Surrey Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"O'Reilly","id":"37085860581"},{"name":"Alex Gluhak","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research University of Surrey Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Gluhak","id":"37085471922"},{"name":"Muhammad Imran","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research University of Surrey Guildford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Imran","id":"37265529100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1180-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"6661900","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Vectors","Training","Data models","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online anomaly detection","incremental centred kernel hypersphere","data analysis","high computational complexity","data stream","computational complexity reduction","synthetic datasets","real-world datasets","incremental kernel hypersphere"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Kernel Methods","One-Class Classification","Nonstationary Environment","Adaptive Models"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection is an important aspect of data analysis.

Thus our model is particularly effective for modelling high-dimensional time-series with limited number of instances in the minority positive class. We conduct extensive classification experiments based on several well-known time-series datasets (both single-and multi-modal) by first randomly generating synthetic instances from our learned mixture model to correct the imbalance. We then compare our results to several state-of-the-art oversampling techniques and the results demonstrate that when our proposed model is used, the same support vector machines classifier achieves much better classification accuracy across the range of datasets. In fact, the proposed method achieves the best average performance 27 times out of 30 multi-modal datasets according to the F-value metric.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Covariance matrices","Computational modeling","Graphical models","Vectors","Random variables","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance analysis","Gaussian processes","pattern classification","sampling methods","support vector machines","time series","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixture-of-Gaussian trees model","F-value metric","classification accuracy","support vector machines classifier","oversampling techniques","learned mixture model","randomly generating synthetic instances","minority positive class","high-dimensional time-series","close-by time points","imbalanced time-series binary classification","multimodal minority class","parsimonious statistical model","MOGT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Imbalanced dataset","Time-series","Oversampling","Gaussian graphical models","Mixture models","Multi-modality"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661937","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648476/6661888/06661937.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOGT: Oversampling with a parsimonious mixture of Gaussian trees model for imbalanced time-series classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MOGT: Oversampling with a parsimonious mixture of Gaussian trees model for imbalanced time-series classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661937/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6661937/","accessionNumber":"13898749","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOGT: Oversampling with a parsimonious mixture of Gaussian trees model for imbalanced time-series classification","confLoc":"Southampton, UK","sourcePdf":"final22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075524S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648476","isNumber":"6661888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648476","xplore-issue":"6661888","articleId":"6661937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6661944,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Simulations are provided to examine the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661888","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648476/6661888/06661946.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint canonical polyadic decomposition of two tensors with one shared loading matrix","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6661946/","displayDocTitle":"Joint canonical polyadic decomposition of two tensors with one shared loading matrix","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898668","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint canonical polyadic decomposition of two tensors with one shared loading matrix","confLoc":"Southampton, UK","sourcePdf":"final36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094616S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648476","isNumber":"6661888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648476","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6661888","articleId":"6661946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6661950,"authors":[{"name":"Narges Armanfard","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Narges","lastName":"Armanfard","id":"37670813600"},{"name":"James P.

A feature set (possibly different in size and members) is assigned to each representative point.

In this paper, we provide an experimental comparison of some established beamforming and post-filtering techniques on the one hand and modern BSS techniques involving advanced spectral models on the other hand. We analyze the results as a function of the number of microphones, the number of speakers and the input Signal-to-Noise Ratio (iSNR) w.r.t. multichannel real-world environmental noise recordings. The results of the comparison show that, provided that a suitable post-filter or spectral model is chosen, beamforming performs similar to BSS on average in the single-speaker case while in the two-speaker case BSS exceeds beamformer performance. Crucially, this claim holds independently of the number of microphones.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661961","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648476/6661888/06661961.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2013.6661961","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental comparison of source separation and beamforming techniques for microphone array signal enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6661961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An experimental comparison of source separation and beamforming techniques for microphone array signal enhancement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6661961/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6661961/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898713","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental comparison of source separation and beamforming techniques for microphone array signal enhancement","confLoc":"Southampton, UK","sourcePdf":"final57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072888S","chronDate":"22-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648476","isNumber":"6661888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648476","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6661888","articleId":"6661961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6661988,"authors":[{"name":"Nobutaka Ono","affiliation":["Sogo Kenkyu Daigakuin Daigaku, Miura-gun, Kanagawa, JP"],"firstName":"Nobutaka","lastName":"Ono","id":"37280832000"},{"name":"Zbyn\u011bk Koldovsk\u00fd","affiliation":["Technicka univerzita v Liberci, Liberec, Liberec Region, CZ"],"firstName":"Zbyn\u011bk","lastName":"Koldovsk\u00fd","id":"38490205000"},{"name":"Shigeki Miyabe","affiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeki","lastName":"Miyabe","id":"37391457700"},{"name":"Nobutaka Ito","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Labs NTT Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobutaka","lastName":"Ito","id":"37077363400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1180-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"6661988","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":362},"abstract":"This paper summarizes the 2013 community-based Signal Separation Evaluation Campaign (SiSEC 2013).

Multiple signal paths due to multiple antennas positioned at transmitter or receiver are responsible for large throughput. The eventual objective of using array of small antennas is that each single antenna will have small power consumption. The rapid increase in the number of wireless applications has put some limitations on conventional MIMO systems on channel capacity, energy and spectral efficiency. One of the possible solutions to overcome these limitations is to use large antenna arrays at the base stations or to some extent on the user equipments (UEs). The essential factors that must be considered before the deployment of massive MIMO systems include the broadcast models, channel estimation, placement ways with applications, uplink & downlink benefits and precoding procedures, expected achievable energy & spectral efficiencies, etc. In this article a comparison of massive MIMO is made with conventional MIMO. The authors discussed the massive MIMO system deployment scenarios, the best possible downlink precoding scheme for maximum achievable throughput, energy and spectral efficiency.","publicationTitle":"2013 19th International Conference on Automation and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 19th International Conference on Automation and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6642546/6661997/06662017.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large scaled multi-user MIMO system so called massive MIMO systems for future wireless communication networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662017/","displayDocTitle":"Large scaled multi-user MIMO system so called massive MIMO systems for future wireless communication networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898412","conferenceDate":"13-14 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large scaled multi-user MIMO system so called massive MIMO systems for future wireless communication networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027169S","chronDate":"13-14 Sept. 2013","isNumber":"6661997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6642546","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6662017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6662027,"authors":[{"name":"Christoforos Economakos","affiliation":["Technological Educational Institution of Sterea Ellada, Department of Automation Engineering, GR34400 Psahna, Evia, Greece"],"firstName":"Christoforos","lastName":"Economakos"},{"name":"Harry Sidiropoulos","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, GR"],"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Sidiropoulos"},{"name":"George Economakos","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, GR"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Economakos"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-908549-08-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6662027","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","System-on-chip","Computer architecture","Microcontrollers","Software","Productivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","digital control","high level synthesis","microcontrollers","rapid prototyping (industrial)","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rapid prototyping","FPGA","field programmable gate arrays","ESL-HLS design methodologies","electronic system level","high-level synthesis","embedded automation applications","time-to-market schedules","computational complexity","power efficiency","abstraction level","system-on-chip","SoC architecture","hardware acceleration","application cores","floating point calculations","peripheral device integration","RISC microcontroller","designer productivity","C level design descriptions","digital control applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital control","rapid prototyping","FPGAs","electronic system-level design","high-level synthesis"]}],"abstract":"Recent advances in embedded automation applications require quality of results in terms of speed and computational complexity, along with strict time-to-market schedules. To cope with these demands, the design industry is searching for novel approaches. Performance is sought by utilizing modern FPGA devices, offering hundreds of GFLOPs with maximum power efficiency. Productivity is enforced with HighLevel Synthesis (HLS) and Electronic System Level (ESL) design methodologies, that offer an efficient abstraction level to boost-up early prototyping. This paper presents a methodology and the required tool flow for the design of a System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, as a reference for modern control applications. The advantages of the proposed methodology are: (a) improved performance through hardware acceleration of demanding application cores, (b) improved quality of results with floating point calculations, (c) flexibility and integration of common peripheral devices supported by a RISC microcontroller and (d) improved designer productivity by avoiding Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and other time consuming and error introducing procedures and working with C level design descriptions only. Experimental results show that the proposed SoC architecture is an efficient rapid prototyping platform for digital control applications, with very promising future extension capabilities.","publicationTitle":"2013 19th International Conference on Automation and Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 19th International Conference on Automation and Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6642546/6661997/06662027.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid prototyping of digital controllers using FPGAs and ESL/HLS design methodologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662027/","displayDocTitle":"Rapid prototyping of digital controllers using FPGAs and ESL/HLS design methodologies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"13-14 Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898400","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid prototyping of digital controllers using FPGAs and ESL/HLS design methodologies","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080593S","chronDate":"13-14 Sept. 2013","isNumber":"6661997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6642546","articleId":"6662027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6662150,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Birklykke","affiliation":["Department for Electronic Systems, Technology Platform Section, Aalborg \u00d8"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Birklykke","id":"37706711500"},{"name":"Peter Koch","affiliation":["Department for Electronic Systems, Technology Platform Section, Aalborg \u00d8"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Koch","id":"37296746400"},{"name":"Ramjee Prasad","affiliation":["Department for Electronic Systems, Center for TeleInFrastruktur Aalborg University, Aalborg \u00d8"],"firstName":"Ramjee","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37275200300"},{"name":"Lars Alminde","affiliation":["GomSpace APS, Aalborg \u00d8"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Alminde","id":"37281825900"},{"name":"Yannick Le Moullec","affiliation":["Department for Electronic Systems, Technology Platform Section, Aalborg \u00d8"],"firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Le Moullec","id":"37085494853"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1170-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6662150","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Error analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Timing","Integrated circuit modeling","Probabilistic logic","Threshold voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit modelling","logic design","logic testing","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault model","FPGA","subcritical voltage region","bit-level error behavior","field programmable gate arrays","voltage scaling","subcritical scaling","digital design practice","probabilistic error model","binary signal statistical properties","observed error rates","polynomial dependency","outcome probability","timing error model","fault mechanism","temporary stuck-at errors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662150","abstract":"We present a rigorous empirical study of the bit-level error behavior of field programmable gate arrays operating in the subcricital voltage region. This region is of significant interest as voltage-scaling under normal circumstances is halted by the first occurrence of errors. However, accurate fault models might provide insight that would allow subcritical scaling by changing digital design practices or by simply accepting errors if possible. To facilitate further work in this direction, we present probabilistic error models that allow us to link error behavior with statistical properties of the binary signals, and based on a two-FPGA setup we experimentally verify the correctness of candidate models. For all experiments, the observed error rates exhibit a polynomial dependency on outcome probability of the binary inputs, which corresponds to the behavior predicted by the proposed timing error model. Furthermore, our results show that the fault mechanism is fully deterministic - mimicking temporary stuck-at errors. As a result, given knowledge about a given signal, errors are fully predictable in the subcritical voltage region.","doi":"10.1109/PATMOS.2013.6662150","publicationTitle":"2013 23rd International Workshop on Power and Timing Modeling, Optimization and Simulation (PATMOS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 23rd International Workshop on Power and Timing Modeling, Optimization and Simulation (PATMOS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6646388/6662142/06662150.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PATMOS.2013.6662150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical verification of fault models for FPGAs operating in the subcritical voltage region","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Empirical verification of fault models for FPGAs operating in the subcritical voltage region","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6662150/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898479","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical verification of fault models for FPGAs operating in the subcritical voltage region","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056428S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6646388","isNumber":"6662142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6646388","xplore-issue":"6662142","articleId":"6662150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6662151,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Burns","affiliation":["Newcastle Upon Tyne, Newcastle University, UK"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Burns","id":"37271383100"},{"name":"Abdullah Baz","affiliation":["Newcastle Upon Tyne, Newcastle University, UK"],"firstName":"Abdullah","lastName":"Baz","id":"37085518462"},{"name":"Delong Shang","affiliation":["Newcastle Upon Tyne, Newcastle University, UK"],"firstName":"Delong","lastName":"Shang","id":"37271384100"},{"name":"Alex Yakovlev","affiliation":["Newcastle Upon Tyne, Newcastle University, UK"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Yakovlev","id":"37281350900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1170-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6662151","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","MOS devices","Robustness","Implants","Transistors","Timing","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variability analysis","self-timed SRAM robustness","circuit level","SRAM memory cells","VARMA","multipartitioned surface response","back-end Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662151","abstract":"This paper focusses on variability analysis for analyzing the robustness of self-timed SRAM to random process variations.

This has been accomplished by employing a variability analysis tool, VARMA, which facilitates the job of analyzing the robustness to variation of process parameters. We have augmented the VARMA tool to use efficient multi-partitioned surface response with back-end Monte Carlo simulation to analyse the problem.

With the scaling down of CMOS technology, failure from process variation and high power consumption has become severe problem in VLSI design and the traditional conservative methodology is about to reach its limit. The technique of adaptive clocking has been proved promising to jointly address the mentioned two issues above. Previous works have focused on two or multi-stage predictions of present input data with error recovery but ignored the data correlation, which could result plenty of redundant cycles. In this work, along with the present data, sequence dependence between successive data is also introduced into function speculation and realized by a simple feedback strategy. Analytical energy saving and performance models have been deduced and validated by simulation using Hspice with 65nm CMOS technology, where the redundant cycles are eliminated up to 16% and the maximum energy saving is 15% with 3% area overhead, being compared with conventional adaptive clocking adder. Furthermore, the new adder with PTSP is applied to the domain of approximate computation and gets a decrement in error deviation of up to 50% in an accumulator.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of variable latency adder based on present and transitional states prediction","publicationTitle":"2013 23rd International Workshop on Power and Timing Modeling, Optimization and Simulation (PATMOS)","doi":"10.1109/PATMOS.2013.6662164","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 23rd International Workshop on Power and Timing Modeling, Optimization and Simulation (PATMOS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6646388/6662142/06662164.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PATMOS.2013.6662164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662142","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Design of variable latency adder based on present and transitional states prediction","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6662164/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898454","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of variable latency adder based on present and transitional states prediction","confLoc":"Karlsruhe, Germany","sourcePdf":"120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088364S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6646388","isNumber":"6662142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6646388","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6662142","articleId":"6662164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6662182,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios Tzimpragos","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical, University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Tzimpragos","id":"37078104500"},{"name":"Christoforos Kachris","affiliation":["Athens Information Technology, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Christoforos","lastName":"Kachris","id":"38568012800"},{"name":"Dimitrios Soudris","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical, University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Soudris","id":"37271305000"},{"name":"Ioannis Tomkos","affiliation":["Athens Information Technology, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Tomkos","id":"37273562500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1170-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6662182","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662182","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Parity check codes","Table lookup","Power demand","Encoding","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","cyclic codes","error correction codes","parity check codes","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity QC-LDPC encoders","automatic implementation","low density parity check codes","design space exploration","design parameters","power consumption","maximum clock frequency","resources utilization","block-memories","cyclic-shifters","LUT","design methodology","hardware savings","low-complexity quasi-cyclic LDPC","VHDL codes","electronic design automation tool","Shannon limit","disk storage systems","error correction codes"]}],"abstract":"Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes are a special class of error correction codes widely used in communication and disk storage systems, due to their Shannon limit approaching performance and their favorable structure.

The second study shows how the dynamics of basic memristor circuits may strongly depend on the memristor model under use. The development of a more universal memristor model is thus necessary for the progress of memristor-based IC design. Here we present some preliminary result on a new modeling approach based on polynomial series expansion.","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662200","publicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653328/6662190/06662200.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Insights on memristor modeling","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899698","htmlLink":"/document/6662200/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Insights on memristor modeling","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"ecctd2013submission108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115172S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653328","isNumber":"6662190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653328","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6662190","articleId":"6662200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TU Dresden","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6662202,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Braunschweig","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Braunschweig","id":"37704734500"},{"name":"Jens M\u00fcller","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"M\u00fcller","id":"37085570793"},{"name":"Jan M\u00fcller","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"M\u00fcller","id":"37085570782"},{"name":"Ronald Tetzlaff","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Tetzlaff","id":"37266586300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-043785-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6662202","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Arrays","Random access memory","Program processors","Emulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","nonlinear network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","processing elements linear array","virtual cellular network","cellular nonlinear networks","CNN cells","NERO mastering"]}],"abstract":"A novel massively-parallel fine-grain architecture featuring a digital emulation of Cellular Nonlinear Networks (CNN) is presented.

Asynchronous routing circuits are typically employed to efficiently interface these modules, and configurable memory is usually used to implement synaptic connectivity among them. However, supporting arbitrary network connectivity with conventional routing methods would require prohibitively large memory resources. We propose a two stage routing scheme which minimizes the memory requirements needed to implement scalable and reconfigurable spiking neural networks with bounded connectivity. Our routing methodology trades off network configuration flexibility for routing memory demands and is optimized for the most common and anatomically realistic neural network topologies. We describe and analyze our routing method and present a case study with a large neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662203","publicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653328/6662190/06662203.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A memory-efficient routing method for large-scale spiking neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662203/","displayDocTitle":"A memory-efficient routing method for large-scale spiking neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899625","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6662203/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A memory-efficient routing method for large-scale spiking neural networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"ecctd2013submission111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064706S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653328","isNumber":"6662190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653328","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6662190","articleId":"6662203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TU Dresden","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6662204,"authors":[{"name":"Elton N.

Back-gate biasing is used to manipulate gate work-function to extract variation aware and low power design. Built-in feedback mechanism is employed to achieve variation tolerant design during read operation.

Since the proposed scheme is easily implemented with a very simple technique, we can reduce power consumption and chip area drastically.

An equivalent circuit of three neighboring memristors of a memory matrix with complicated mutual capacitive and inductive connection is presented.

Two possible values of the coefficient of magnetic coupling between the memristors are used. A SIMULINK model of the circuit of three neighboring memristors is developed. The simulation is made at pulse mode with 3 GHz actuating voltages. The main result is that the parasitic parameters do not strongly affect the memristor voltage drops at frequencies up to 3 GHz. However the tolerances of the memristor parameters have stronger effect on the circuit characteristics. Finally, some concluding remarks associated with the magnetic and capacitive influence between the memristors and the leakage and parasitic resistances of a memristor memory matrix are given.","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662269","publicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653328/6662190/06662269.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the mutual inductive and capacitive connections and tolerances of memristors parameters of a memristor memory matrix","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the mutual inductive and capacitive connections and tolerances of memristors parameters of a memristor memory matrix","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899590","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the mutual inductive and capacitive connections and tolerances of memristors parameters of a memristor memory matrix","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"ecctd2013submission21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059989S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","isNumber":"6662190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653328","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6662269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6662271,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Brandonisio","affiliation":["Tyndall National Institute and University College Cork, Cork"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Brandonisio","id":"37542997400"},{"name":"Alberto Prodomo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Prodomo","id":"37086719102"},{"name":"Michael Peter Kennedy","affiliation":["Tyndall National Institute and University College Cork, Cork"],"firstName":"Michael Peter","lastName":"Kennedy","id":"37274464100"},{"name":"Ettore Napoli","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Ettore","lastName":"Napoli","id":"37268558100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-043785-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6662271","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a pulse-holding Time-to-Digital Converter on an FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653328/6662190/06662271.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662190","doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662271","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay lines","Pulse measurements","Field programmable gate arrays","Software packages","Quantization (signal)","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit noise","field programmable gate arrays","filters","quantisation (signal)","time-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving average filter","quantization noise removal","maximum modulus","Simulink model","pulse-shrinking TDC","pulse-holding TDC","Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA","pulse-holding time-to-digital converter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662271","abstract":"In this work, we describe the implementation of a pulse-holding Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) on a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA.

Because a digital counter is inherently present in this conversion scheme, one common practice is to use a digital-to-analog converter driven by the counter to generate the ramp. Given the direct relationship between the DAC and the ADC transfer characteristics, one of the main issues is to ensure a sufficient linearity of the DAC, with special emphasis on its monotonicity. Very often, in particular when medium to high resolutions are aimed, this requires calibration of the DAC, which must be repeated every once in a while to account for temperature, process, power supply, and aging variations. This paper presents an inherently monotonic ramp generator with high levels of linearity and stability against any expected source of variations, combined with a very efficient realization and an inherent automatic adaptability to different resolutions. The ramp generator has been designed using radiation hardening by design (RHBD) techniques, allowing its use in space applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Voltage control","Capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits","Thermal stability","Signal resolution","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","image sensors","readout electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip CMOS ramp generation","high resolution single-slope ADC","image sensors","readout structures","readout architecture","digital counter","conversion scheme","digital-to-analog converter","power supply","monotonic ramp generator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ramp generator","single-slope ADCs","CMOS mixed-signal ASICs","image sensors","aerospace electronics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662334","publicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653328/6662190/06662334.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCTD.2013.6662334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive approach to on-chip CMOS ramp generation for high resolution single-slope ADCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive approach to on-chip CMOS ramp generation for high resolution single-slope ADCs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662334/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6662334/","accessionNumber":"13899615","conferenceDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive approach to on-chip CMOS ramp generation for high resolution single-slope ADCs","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"ecctd2013submission93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043803S","chronDate":"8-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653328","isNumber":"6662190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653328","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6662190","articleId":"6662334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"TU Dresden","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6662351,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Madria","affiliation":["Missouri University of Science & Technology"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/52/6774316/6662351/6662351-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["","SANJAY MADRIA is a full professor in the department of computer science at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Unfortunately, no live migration progress management system exists in the state-of-theart, leading to (1) guesswork over how long a migration might take and the inability to schedule dependent tasks accordingly; (2) unacceptable application degradation when application components become split over distant cloud datacenters for an arbitrary period during migration; (3) inability to tradeoff application performance and migration time e.g. to finish migration later for less impact on application performance. Pacer is the first migration progress management system that solves these problems. Pacer's techniques are based on robust and lightweight run-time measurements of system and workload characteristics, efficient and accurate analytic models for progress predictions, and online adaptation to maintain user-defined migration objectives for coordinated and timely migrations. Our experiments on a local testbed and on Amazon EC2 show that Pacer is highly effective under a range of application workloads and network conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2013.111013.130522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2013.111013.130522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/6681633/06662353.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Pacer: A Progress Management System for Live Virtual Machine Migration in Cloud Computing","volume":"10","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13969720","htmlLink":"/document/6662353/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","publicationDate":"December 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pacer: A Progress Management System for Live Virtual Machine Migration in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"369-tnsm1312-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086233S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"6681633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6681633","articleId":"6662353","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6662371,"authors":[{"name":"Mario A.

The main objective of VSPT is to obtain an integer number of samples per grid period, which solves the main problem of RC, i.e., the loss of rejection to periodic disturbances due to grid frequency drift. The sampling/switching frequency is adjusted with a variable sampling period filter phase-locked loop, which also adds robustness to the system due to its inherent tolerance to grid voltage distortion and unbalances, and events such as frequency steps and faults. The control and synchronism subsystems are described, designed, and verified experimentally in a 10-kW WPGS. The results obtained prove the accuracy of the proposed control even under severe disturbances, typical in grids with high WPGS penetration, providing ancillary functions to enhance reliability and reduce operational costs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6662371/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14057312","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Repetitive Control With Adaptive Sampling Frequency for Wind Power Generation Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repetitive Control With Adaptive Sampling Frequency for Wind Power Generation Systems","sourcePdf":"jestpe-herran-2290572-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094674S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6728629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6728629","articleId":"6662371","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6662379,"authors":[{"name":"Shenghua Gao","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6685907/6662379/6662379-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shenghua Gao received the B.E. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University in 2013.

Such category-specific dictionaries encode subtle visual differences among different categories, while the shared dictionary encodes common visual patterns among all the categories. To this end, we impose incoherence constraints among the different dictionaries in the objective of feature coding. In addition, to make the learnt dictionary stable, we also impose the constraint that each dictionary should be self-incoherent. Our proposed dictionary learning formulation not only applies to fine-grained classification, but also improves conventional basic-level object categorization and other tasks such as event recognition. Experimental results on five data sets show that our method can outperform the state-of-the-art fine-grained image categorization frameworks as well as sparse coding based dictionary learning frameworks. All these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662379","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Image coding","Image representation","Encoding","Feature extraction","Optimization","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionaries","image classification","image coding","learning (artificial intelligence)","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning category-specific dictionary","shared dictionary","visual differences","visual patterns","feature coding","fine-grained classification","basic-level object categorization","event recognition","data sets","fine-grained image categorization frameworks","sparse coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-specific dictionary","shared dictionary","fine-grained classification"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6685907/06662379.pdf","startPage":"623","endPage":"634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685907","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2290593","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2290593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Category-Specific Dictionary and Shared Dictionary for Fine-Grained Image Categorization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662379/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Category-Specific Dictionary and Shared Dictionary for Fine-Grained Image Categorization","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"13989827","pubMedId":"24239999","htmlLink":"/document/6662379/","volume":"23","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Category-Specific Dictionary and Shared Dictionary for Fine-Grained Image Categorization","sourcePdf":"tip-gao-2290593-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110598S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6685907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6685907","articleId":"6662379","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6662385,"authors":[{"name":"Wayne Water","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Griffith University, Nathan, Queensland, Australia"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Water","id":"37987351600"},{"name":"Junwei Lu","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Griffith University, Nathan, Queensland, Australia"],"firstName":"Junwei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278636000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-307X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3088"}],"articleNumber":"6662385","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1000},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662385","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prototypes","Windings","Inductance","Transformer cores","Voltage measurement","Magnetic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","finite element analysis","high-frequency transformers","inductance","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["line level control resonant converters","LLC resonant converters","improved high-frequency magnetic-integrated planar transformer","leakage inductance adjustment","multistrand Litz wires","EE shape magnetic cores","magnetic insertions","three-dimensional finite-element model","eddy current losses"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic instruments","finite-element methods","integrated circuit fabrication","transformers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LMAG.2013.2284767","endPage":"4","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Magnetics Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Magnetics Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165412/6423904/06662385.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMAG.2013.2284767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6423904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved High-Frequency Planar Transformer for Line Level Control (LLC) Resonant Converters","abstract":"An improved high-frequency magnetic-integrated planar transformer is demonstrated.

The system robustly detects important rail components such as ties, tie plates, and anchors, with high accuracy and efficiency. To achieve this goal, we first develop a set of image and video analytics and then propose a novel global optimization framework to combine evidence from multiple cameras, Global Positioning System, and distance measurement instrument to further improve the detection performance. Moreover, as the anchor is an important type of rail fastener, we have thus advanced the effort to detect anchor exceptions, which includes assessing the anchor conditions at the tie level and identifying anchor pattern exceptions at the compliance level. Quantitative analysis performed on a large video data set captured with different track and lighting conditions, as well as on a real-time field test, has demonstrated very encouraging performance on both rail component detection and anchor exception detection. Specifically, an average of 94.67% precision and 93% recall rate has been achieved for detecting all three rail components, and a 100% detection rate is achieved for compliance-level anchor exception with three false positives per hour. To our best knowledge, our system is the first to address and solve both component and exception detection problems in this rail inspection area.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/6782656/06662397.pdf","startPage":"760","endPage":"770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2013.2287155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2013.2287155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782656","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rail Component Detection, Optimization, and Assessment for Automatic Rail Track Inspection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rails","Cameras","Inspection","Optimization","Image edge detection","Streaming media","Fasteners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic optical inspection","computer vision","distance measurement","engineering computing","fasteners","Global Positioning System","optimisation","plates (structures)","railway engineering","railway safety","real-time systems","video cameras","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rail component detection","rail component optimization","real-time automatic vision-based rail inspection system","automatic rail track inspection","rail component assessment","exception detection problems","compliance-level anchor exception","video data set","rail fastener","distance measurement instrument","Global Positioning System","multiple cameras","video analytics","image analytics","anchors","tie plates","ties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anchor exception detection","machine vision technology","multisensor evidence integration","rail component detection","railroad track inspection"]},{"kwd":["Anchor exception detection","machine vision technology","multisensor evidence integration","rail component detection","railroad track inspection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Rail Component Detection, Optimization, and Assessment for Automatic Rail Track Inspection","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6662397/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14220059","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rail Component Detection, Optimization, and Assessment for Automatic Rail Track Inspection","sourcePdf":"tits-li-2287155-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081406S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6782656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6782656","articleId":"6662397","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6662407,"authors":[{"name":"Thanh Hai Thai","affiliation":["Troyes University of Technology, Laboratory Systems Modeling and Dependability, Troyes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6657713/6662407/6662407-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thanh Hai Thai received a double engineering diploma/M.S. degree in optimization and safety of systems from the Troyes University of Technology in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

The approach is based on the heteroscedastic noise model, which more accurately describes a natural raw image. This model is characterized by only two parameters, which are considered as unique fingerprint to identify camera models. The camera model identification problem is cast in the framework of hypothesis testing theory. In an ideal context where all model parameters are perfectly known, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is presented and its performances are theoretically established. For a practical use, two generalized LRTs are designed to deal with unknown model parameters so that they can meet a prescribed false alarm probability while ensuring a high detection performance. Numerical results on simulated images and real natural raw images highlight the relevance of the proposed approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

pulse position modulation (WOPPM) and optical AND logic gate receiver are analyzed. These analyses are performed by considering the multiple access interference as the main limiting factor. Because of the power limitation in some laser sources, the same-symbol-power scheme for all users is assumed. Optical orthogonal codes with the same length are assigned to the users of each class. Considering the throughput as constraint, the effects of the number of users in each class and the weight of low-weight users on the performance of each class are examined and the results are compared with the same-mark-power case. Finally, the effect of WOPPM signaling parameters such as overlapping index and total number of symbols on the error probability of each class is investigated in the presence and in the absence of throughput constraint. Our results show that when the multi-level technique is employed in WOPPM OCDMA systems, one can find solutions for some design problems that cannot be handled by conventional one-level methods. In addition to this benefit, employing this technique leads to a less complex transceiver structure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Two-Level Asynchronous Optical CDMA Systems Utilizing Wrapped OPPM","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2290713","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6671932/06662408.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2290713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6671932","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662408/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Two-Level Asynchronous Optical CDMA Systems Utilizing Wrapped OPPM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2013","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2014","accessionNumber":"13949954","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Two-Level Asynchronous Optical CDMA Systems Utilizing Wrapped OPPM","sourcePdf":"jlt-ghorbansabbagh-2290713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068312S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2014","isNumber":"6671932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6662408","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6662412,"authors":[{"name":"Li Jianli","affiliation":["Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Key Laboratory of Fundamental Science for National Defense-Novel Inertial Instrument and Navigation System Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6704724/6662412/6662412-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Jianli was born in 1979.

To reduce the temperature error and improve the generalization ability of traditional neural network, a novel error model based on radial basis function neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and regularization approach was proposed. The temperature error is analyzed and preprocessed. The PSO method is used to search the optimal configuration of the network, and regularization method is used as the evaluation criterion to further optimize the coefficients of the network. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the precision and environmental adaptability of RLG, which had been practically applied in RLG position and orientation system.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2290699","startPage":"912","endPage":"919","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6704724/06662412.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2290699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature Error Modeling of RLG Based on Neural Network Optimized by PSO and Regularization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Temperature measurement","Temperature","Temperature sensors","Training","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","gyroscopes","particle swarm optimisation","radial basis function networks","ring lasers","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature error modeling","RLG","PSO","ring laser gyroscope","radial basis function neural network optimization","particle swarm optimization","regularization approach","sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Temperature error","ring laser gyroscope","particle swarm optimization","neural network","regularization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662412/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Temperature Error Modeling of RLG Based on Neural Network Optimized by PSO and Regularization","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6662412/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14055210","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature Error Modeling of RLG Based on Neural Network Optimized by PSO and Regularization","sourcePdf":"jsen-jianli-2290699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070264S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6704724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6704724","articleId":"6662412","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6662416,"authors":[{"name":"Wonjun Kim","affiliation":["Multimedia Processing Lab., Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6781564/6662416/kim-2290579-small.gif","p":["Wonjun Kim (M'13) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, the M.S. degree from the Department of Information and Communications, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, and the Ph.D. degree from the Computational Imaging Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, in 2006, 2008, and 2012, respectively.

However, most existing methods are easily biased toward edges or corners, which are statistically significant, but not necessarily relevant. Moreover, they often fail to find salient regions in complex scenes due to ambiguities between salient regions and highly textured backgrounds. In this paper, we present a novel unified framework for spatiotemporal saliency detection based on textural contrast. Our method is simple and robust, yet biologically plausible; thus, it can be easily extended to various applications, such as image retargeting, object segmentation, and video surveillance. Based on various datasets, we conduct comparative evaluations of 12 representative saliency detection models presented in the literature, and the results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other previously developed methods in detecting salient regions of the static and dynamic scenes.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2290579","startPage":"646","endPage":"659","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6781564/06662416.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2290579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6781564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatiotemporal Saliency Detection Using Textural Contrast and Its Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coherence","Visualization","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Image color analysis","Computational modeling","Robustness","Retina"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","edge detection","image segmentation","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal saliency detection","textural contrast","computer vision","salient regions","image retargeting","object segmentation","video surveillance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Saliency detection","computer vision applications","human visual attention","textural contrast","comparative evaluations"]},{"kwd":["Comparative evaluations","computer vision applications","human visual attention","saliency detection","textural contrast"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Spatiotemporal Saliency Detection Using Textural Contrast and Its Applications","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6662416/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14210060","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatiotemporal Saliency Detection Using Textural Contrast and Its Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-kim-2290579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111798S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6781564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6781564","articleId":"6662416","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6662418,"authors":[{"name":"Jinming Xu","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6777358/6662418/6662418-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinming Xu (S'13) was born in Jiangsu Province, China, in 1987.

However, with only injected grid current control, the current harmonics and low bandwidth caused by the resonance peak cannot be tolerated. The active damping (AD) method with an extra feedback provides a high rejection of the resonance so that the dynamic is improved; however, the high-precision sensing circuit for the extra feedback increases the cost. In this paper, with the signal flow graph and response-fitting methods, an AD method based on the feedback of the injected grid current has been proposed. Then, the novel closed-loop current control requires accurately sensing the injected grid current only, while no observation is needed. Compared with the extra feedback methods, the cost and the complexity are reduced while the reliability is improved. Based on the study of the relation between the controller and the system dynamic, a straightforward design has been proposed. The robustness, harmonic rejection, and digital implementation have been studied. Compared with the conventional control methods, the proposed one promises the satisfactory performance with both analog and digital implementations. Simulations and experiments have verified the proposed control and design strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2290771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6777358/06662418.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2290771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777358","startPage":"4746","endPage":"4758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Damping-Based Control for Grid-Connected --Filtered Inverter With Injected Grid Current Feedback Only","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active Damping-Based Control for Grid-Connected <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LCL$ </tex></formula>-Filtered Inverter With Injected Grid Current Feedback Only","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662418/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14181314","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6662418/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Damping-Based Control for Grid-Connected <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$LCL$ </tex></formula>-Filtered Inverter With Injected Grid Current Feedback Only","sourcePdf":"tie-xu-2290771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126132S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6777358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"203","xplore-issue":"6777358","articleId":"6662418","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6662443,"authors":[{"name":"Lingjie Wang","affiliation":["Accelink Technologies Co.

Given significant uncertainties involved in wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting provides a unique solution to estimate and quantify the potential impacts and risks facing system operation with wind penetration beforehand. This paper proposes a novel hybrid intelligent algorithm approach to directly formulate optimal prediction intervals of wind power generation based on extreme learning machine and particle swarm optimization. Prediction intervals with associated confidence levels are generated through direct optimization of both the coverage probability and sharpness to ensure the quality. The proposed method does not involve the statistical inference or distribution assumption of forecasting errors needed in most existing methods.

This paper reviews algorithms for spatial filter computation and introduces a general framework for this task based on divergence maximization. We show that the popular common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm can be formulated as a divergence maximization problem and computed within our framework. Our approach easily permits enforcing different invariances and utilizing information from other subjects; thus, it unifies many of the recently proposed CSP variants in a principled manner. Furthermore, it allows to design novel spatial filtering algorithms by incorporating regularization schemes into the optimization process or applying other divergences. We evaluate the proposed approach using three regularization schemes, investigate the advantages of beta divergence, and show that subject-independent feature spaces can be extracted by jointly optimizing the divergence problems of multiple users. We discuss the relations to several CSP variants and investigate the advantages and limitations of our approach with simulations. Finally, we provide experimental results on a dataset containing recordings from 80 subjects and interpret the obtained patterns from a neurophysiological perspective.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6805676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2013.2290621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/4664312/6805676/06662468.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"72","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2013.2290621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Divergence-Based Framework for Common Spatial Patterns Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","displayDocTitle":"Divergence-Based Framework for Common Spatial Patterns Algorithms","volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6662468/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14267006","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","pubMedId":"24240027","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Divergence-Based Framework for Common Spatial Patterns Algorithms","sourcePdf":"rbme-samek-2290621-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150838S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"6805676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6805676","articleId":"6662468","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6662469,"authors":[{"name":"Qingsong Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6809870/6662469/xu-2290758-small.gif","p":["\nQingsong Xu (M'09) received the B.S. degree in mechatronics\nengineering (with honors) from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2002 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees\nin electromechanical engineering from the University of Macau, Macao, China, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He was a Visiting Scholar at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, Switzerland, and the National\nUniversity of Singapore, Singapore.

The scheme facilitates a rapid implementation because the construction of either a hysteresis model or a state observer is not needed.

Hence, it is necessary and inevitable to develop fast HEVC encoding algorithms for its potential market adoption. In this paper, we propose a fast intra mode decision for the HEVC encoder. The overall fast intra mode decision algorithm consists of both micro- and macro-level schemes. At the micro-level, we propose the Hadamard cost-based progressive rough mode search (pRMS) to selectively check the potential modes instead of traversing all candidates (i.e., up to 35 in HEVC). Fewer effective candidates will be chosen by the pRMS for the subsequent rate-distortion optimized quantization (RDOQ) to derive the rate-distortion (R-D) optimal mode. An early RDOQ skip method is also introduced to further the complexity reduction. At the macrolevel, we introduce the early coding unit (CU) split termination if the estimated R-D cost [through aggregated R-D costs of (partial) sub-CUs] is already larger than the R-D cost of the current CU. On average, the proposed fast intra mode decision provides about 2.5 \u00d7 speedup (without any platform or source code level optimization) with just a 1.0% Bjontegaard delta rate (BD-rate) increase using the HEVC common test condition. Moreover, our proposed solution also demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in comparison with other works.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2290578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6781564/06662471.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2290578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6781564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Intra Mode Decision for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662471/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Intra Mode Decision for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)","volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14210062","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6662471/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Intra Mode Decision for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-ma-2290578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067312S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6781564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"6781564","articleId":"6662471","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6662472,"authors":[{"name":"Milan Cabarkapa","affiliation":["Wireless Communications Research Group, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"p":["Milan Cabarkapa (S'11) received the B.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees from the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia, in 2009 and 2010.

The proposed architecture is based on simultaneous injection of in-band intermodulation (IM) and cross-modulation (CM) distortion products. A general fundamental-frequency model for concurrent dual-band transmitter is developed theoretically and proofed experimentally. An individual impact of each IM and CM distortion component is theoretically derived and analyzed. It is clearly proven by theoretical analysis and experiments that the proposed predistorter improves the in-band and out-of-band performances of both signals. The simulation and experimental studies are performed using various signal sets. The proposed predistorter does not depend on frequency separation between bands and has low computational complexity in comparison with concurrent dual-band DPD's state-of-the-art. In addition, it is clearly shown in experiments that when using iterative simultaneous injections, a phenomenon known as distortion compensation limit can be reduced. A presence of memory effects and their mitigation in frequency domain for each band of concurrent dual-band transmitter are also demonstrated in experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2287679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2287679","startPage":"4579","endPage":"4590","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6677550/06662472.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized 2-D Linearity Enhancement Architecture for Concurrent Dual-Band Wireless Transmitters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized 2-D Linearity Enhancement Architecture for Concurrent Dual-Band Wireless Transmitters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2013","volume":"61","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6662472/","accessionNumber":"13933796","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662472/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized 2-D Linearity Enhancement Architecture for Concurrent Dual-Band Wireless Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tmtt-budimir-2287679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084928S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6677550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6677550","articleId":"6662472","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":6662473,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Heydari","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6815990/6662473/heyda-2288067-small.gif","p":["Ali Heydari (S'09\u2013M'14) received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA, in 2013.","He is currently an Assistant Professor of mechanical engineering with the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD, USA.

Several rain removal algorithms have been proposed these years, where photometric, chromatic, and probabilistic properties of the rain have been exploited to detect and remove the rainy effect. Current methods generally work well with light rain and relatively static scenes, when dealing with heavier rainfall in dynamic scenes, these methods give very poor visual results. The proposed algorithm is based on motion segmentation of dynamic scene. After applying photometric and chromatic constraints for rain detection, rain removal filters are applied on pixels such that their dynamic property as well as motion occlusion clue are considered; both spatial and temporal informations are then adaptively exploited during rain pixel recovery. Results show that the proposed algorithm has a much better performance for rainy scenes with large motion than existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2290595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6717077/06662475.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2290595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6717077","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Rain Pixel Recovery Algorithm for Videos With Highly Dynamic Scenes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Rain Pixel Recovery Algorithm for Videos With Highly Dynamic Scenes","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662475/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14056310","pubMedId":"24240000","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6662475/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Rain Pixel Recovery Algorithm for Videos With Highly Dynamic Scenes","sourcePdf":"tip-chau-2290595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060627S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6717077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6717077","articleId":"6662475","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6662479,"authors":[{"name":"Robert L.

At first step, a technique called quantization noise reduction (QNR), is introduced to enhance the coding efficiency. By filtering out part of the quantization noise in the whole band of the signal, while the signal envelope is maintained almost constant, the coding efficiency is improved without imposing any additional nonlinearity or distortion to the system. By utilizing this technique for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with 1.25-MHz bandwidth and 80 times oversampling, with 8.1-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), the coding efficiency is improved from 8.8% to 14.5% while the signal-to-noise distortion ratio (SNDR) of the system remains 43 dB. In the next step by using a controlled filtering on in-band quantization noise along with QNR technique, the bandwidth of the signal and efficiency are increased simultaneously without losing as much linearity. The second technique is called quantization noise reduction with in-band filtering or (QNRIF). QNRIF is applied on an OFDM signal with 1.25-MHz bandwidth, with the same PAPR and only 16 times oversampling. The result for the coding efficiency is improved from 7.7% to 18.7% with 41-dB SNDR.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Quantization (signal)","Transmitters","Encoding","Bandwidth","Peak to average power ratio","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma modulation","distortion","encoding","filtering theory","OFDM modulation","quantisation (signal)","radio transmitters","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta-sigma-based transmitters","quantization noise reduction","coding efficiency","signal envelope","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal","peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR","signal-to-noise distortion ratio","SNDR","in-band quantization noise filtering","QNR technique","signal bandwidth","QNRIF","OFDM signal","bandwidth 1.25 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coding efficiency","delta\u2013sigma modulator (DSM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","switching-mode power amplifier (SMPA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2288702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6677544/06662488.pdf","startPage":"4245","endPage":"4251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2288702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Quantization Noise to Boost Efficiency and Signal Bandwidth in Delta\u2013Sigma-Based Transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Quantization Noise to Boost Efficiency and Signal Bandwidth in Delta\u2013Sigma-Based Transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662488/","volume":"61","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6662488/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13933820","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Quantization Noise to Boost Efficiency and Signal Bandwidth in Delta\u2013Sigma-Based Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ebrahimi-2288702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067315S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6677544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6677544","articleId":"6662488","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6662489,"authors":[{"name":"Changzhan Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6677550/6662489/6662489-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changzhan Gu (S\u201907\u2013M\u201913) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in information and electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA, in 2013.","He is currently a Senior RF Systems Engineer at MaxLinear Inc., Irvine, CA, USA.

An ordinary camera was integrated with the system to measure the subject's random body movement (RBM) that is fed back as phase information to the radar system for RBMC. The linearity of the radar system, which is strictly related to the circuit saturation problem in noncontact vital sign detection, has been thoroughly analyzed and discussed. It shows that larger body movement does not necessarily mean larger radar baseband output. High gain configuration at baseband is required for acceptable SNR in noncontact vital sign detection. The phase compensation at radar RF front-end helps to relieve the high-gain baseband from potential saturation in the presence of large body movement. A simple video processing algorithm was presented to extract the RBM without using any marker. Both theoretical analysis and simulation have been carried out to validate the linearity analysis and the proposed RBMC technique. Two experiments were carried out in the lab environment. One is the phase compensation at RF front end to extract a phantom motion in the presence of another large shaker motion, and the other one is to measure the subject person breathing normally but randomly moving his body back and forth. The experimental results show that the proposed radar system is effective to relieve the linearity burden of the baseband circuit and help compensate the RBM.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2288226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6677550/06662489.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2288226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677550","startPage":"4678","endPage":"4688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Radar-Camera Sensing System With Phase Compensation for Random Body Movement Cancellation in Doppler Vital Sign Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Radar-Camera Sensing System With Phase Compensation for Random Body Movement Cancellation in Doppler Vital Sign Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13933759","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6662489/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Radar-Camera Sensing System With Phase Compensation for Random Body Movement Cancellation in Doppler Vital Sign Detection","sourcePdf":"tmtt-gu-2288226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093878S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6677550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6677550","articleId":"6662489","onlineDate":"12 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6662491,"authors":[{"name":"Siddharth Kulasekaran","affiliation":["School for Electrical, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6824280/6662491/6662491-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siddharth Kulasekaran (S\u201912) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Trichy, India, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, AZ, USA, in 2012.

In this work we propose Scrubbing Unit Repositioning for Fast Error Repair (SURFER), a novel approach to exploit partial dynamic reconfiguration coupled with fine-grained redundancy to greatly reduce the MTTR for FPGAs subject to upsets in their configuration memories.","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Compilers, Architecture and Synthesis for Embedded Systems (CASES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648478/6662498/06662506.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scrubbing unit repositioning for fast error repair in FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/CASES.2013.6662506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASES.2013.6662506","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","displayDocTitle":"Scrubbing unit repositioning for fast error repair in FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898777","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-4 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6662506/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scrubbing unit repositioning for fast error repair in FPGAs","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060974S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2013-Oct. 4 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648478","isNumber":"6662498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648478","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6662498","articleId":"6662506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6662507,"authors":[{"name":"Robert J.

As better processors have merged with capable cameras in mobile systems, the number of computer vision applications has grown rapidly. However, the computational and energy constraints of mobile devices have forced computer vision application developers to sacrifice accuracy for the sake of meeting timing demands. To increase the computational performance of mobile systems we present EVA. EVA is an application-specific heterogeneous multicore having a mix of computationally powerful cores with energy efficient cores. Each core of EVA has computation and memory architectural enhancements tailored to the application traits of vision codes. Using a computer vision benchmarking suite, we evaluate the efficiency and performance of a wide range of EVA designs.

Independent changes in active power of every appliance is described by each Markov chain. Having measurements of active power from single meter it is necessary to compute hidden variables defining states of appliance. The Additive Factorial Approximate MAP algorithm allows to designate states of each appliance. Moreover, an analysis of available solutions in terms of measurement frequency and appliance mathematical modeling is presented.

Approximation of a nonlinearly parameterized model of synthetic jet actuator characteristics by a linearly parameterized function is performed using neural network approximators. The nonlinearity function is approximated over a range of rotor rotational speed of a wind turbine blade. An adaptive inverse is employed for cancelling the effect of actuator nonlinearities, which is accomplished by use if another neural network. Adaptive update laws are also employed for estimation of blade physical dimensional parameters.

A resistive loaded n-channel MOSFET based current mirror circuit integrated with a pressure sensing MOSFET was designed using standard 5 \u03bc\u03b7\u03b9 CMOS technology. The piezoresistive effect in MOSFET has been exploited for the calculation of strain induced carrier mobility variation under externally applied pressure. The channel region of the active MOSFET forms a flexible diaphragm of size 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 100 \u03bcm \u00d7 2.5 \u03bcm which deflects under applied pressure. Finite element method based COMSOL Multiphysics is utilized for the simulation of pressure sensor. T-Spice is employed to evaluate the characteristics of the current mirror pressure sensing circuitry. Simulation results show that the MOSFET embedded pressure sensor has a sensitivity of approx. 10.01 mV/MPa. The pressure sensing structure has been optimized for enhancing the sensor sensitivity to approx. 473 mV/MPa. In addition, the variation in the drain currents of the current mirror MOSFETs due to the (a) mismatch of the active and passive devices, and (b) variations in operating temperature and supply voltage have also been investigated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET","Sensors","Mirrors","Piezoresistance","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier mobility","CMOS integrated circuits","current mirrors","diaphragms","electric sensing devices","finite element analysis","integrated circuit design","micromirrors","microsensors","MOSFET","optimisation","piezoresistive devices","pressure sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization","CMOS-MEMS integrated current mirror sensing","MOSFET embedded pressure sensor","resistive loaded n-channel MOSFET based current mirror integrated circuit","standard CMOS technology","piezoresistive effect","strain induced carrier mobility variation calculation","flexible diaphragm","finite element method","COMSOL Multiphysics","T-Spice simulation","drain current variation","passive device","active device","size 5 mum"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCA.2013.6662789","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648508/6662742/06662789.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2013.6662789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and optimization of a CMOS-MEMS integrated current mirror sensing based MOSFET embedded pressure sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6662789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and optimization of a CMOS-MEMS integrated current mirror sensing based MOSFET embedded pressure sensor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662789/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6662789/","accessionNumber":"13898960","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and optimization of a CMOS-MEMS integrated current mirror sensing based MOSFET embedded pressure sensor","confLoc":"Hyderabad, India","sourcePdf":"0152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074684S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648508","isNumber":"6662742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648508","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6662742","articleId":"6662789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6662831,"authors":[{"name":"Pavankumar Tallapragada","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Pavankumar","lastName":"Tallapragada","id":"38488668500"},{"name":"Nikhil Chopra","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Nikhil","lastName":"Chopra","id":"37283228300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1559-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"6662831","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor systems","Asymptotic stability","Closed loop systems","Symmetric matrices","State feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","control system synthesis","decentralised control","distributed sensors","linear systems","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global asymptotic stability","sensor inter-transmission times","positive lower bound","decentralized asynchronous event-triggers","central controller","distributed sensors","central controller","full state feedback","linear time invariant control systems","LTI systems control"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers Linear Time Invariant (LTI) control systems with full state feedback, a central controller and distributed sensors not co-located with the central controller.

Particularly for the embedded systems, the event driven model free control demands even fewer computational resources, since the actuation is allowed only when an event is triggered.

A particularly important task in the SDN context is the placement of such external resources in the network. In this paper, we discuss important aspects of the controller placement problem with a focus on SDN-based core networks, including different types of resilience and failure tolerance. When several performance and resilience metrics are considered, there is usually no single best controller placement solution, but a trade-off between these metrics. We introduce our framework for resilient Pareto-based Optimal COntroller-placement (POCO) that provides the operator of a network with all Pareto-optimal placements. The ideas and mechanisms are illustrated using the Internet2 OS3E topology and further evaluated on more than 140 topologies of the Topology Zoo. In particular, our findings reveal that for most of the topologies more than 20% of all nodes need to be controllers to assure a continuous connection of all nodes to one of the controllers in any arbitrary double link or node failure scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6662939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6662939/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899907","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Pareto-optimal resilient controller placement in SDN-based core networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pareto-optimal resilient controller placement in SDN-based core networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1569735685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053142S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6654374","isNumber":"6662930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6654374","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6662930","articleId":"6662939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":6663008,"authors":[{"name":"Myroslav Komar","affiliation":["Research Institute for Intelligent Computer Systems, Ternopil National Economic University"],"firstName":"Myroslav","lastName":"Komar","id":"37399233400"},{"name":"Vladimir Golovko","affiliation":["Brest State Technical University"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Golovko","id":"37399231300"},{"name":"Anatoly Sachenko","affiliation":["Silesian University of Technology"],"firstName":"Anatoly","lastName":"Sachenko","id":"37273884500"},{"name":"Sergei Bezobrazov","affiliation":["Brest State Technical University"],"firstName":"Sergei","lastName":"Bezobrazov","id":"37944949100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1429-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1426-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1427-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663008","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Neural networks","Immune system","Training","Intrusion detection","Computers","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","neural nets","pattern classification","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network immune detectors","artificial immune system","mutation operations","cloning operations","computer attack recognition","computer attack classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["information telecommunication networks","neural network","artificial immune systems","neural network immune detector"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663008","abstract":"There is developed a combined method that is based on the integration of neural network detectors in an artificial immune system.

The model of a recirculation neural network and usual sequential batch pattern algorithm of its training are theoretically described. An algorithmic description of the parallel version of the batch pattern training method is presented. The experimental research is fulfilled using the Open MPI, Mvapich and Intel MPI message passing libraries. The results obtained on many-core AMD system and Intel MIC are compared with the results obtained on a cluster system. Our results show that the parallelization efficiency is about 95% on 12 cores located inside one physical AMD processor for the considered minimum and maximum scenarios. The parallelization efficiency is about 70-75% on 48 AMD cores for the minimum and maximum scenarios. These results are higher by 15-36% (depending on the version of MPI library) in comparison with the results obtained on 48 cores of a cluster system. The parallelization efficiency obtained on Intel MIC architecture is surprisingly low, asking for deeper analysis.","doi":"10.1109/IDAACS.2013.6663014","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 7th International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems (IDAACS)","startPage":"692","endPage":"698","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 7th International Conference on Intelligent Data Acquisition and Advanced Computing Systems (IDAACS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653329/6662970/06663014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDAACS.2013.6663014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient parallelization of batch pattern training algorithm on many-core and cluster architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Neurons","Algorithm design and analysis","Microwave integrated circuits","Artificial neural networks","Lips","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","batch processing (computers)","learning (artificial intelligence)","message passing","multilayer perceptrons","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","workstation clusters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallelization","batch pattern training algorithm","many-core architectures","cluster architectures","parallel batch pattern back propagation training algorithm","recirculation neural network","many-core high performance computing systems","multilayer perceptron","radial basis neural networks","sequential batch pattern algorithm","parallel version","batch pattern training method","Open MPI","Mvapich","Intel MPI message passing libraries","many-core AMD system","cluster system","physical AMD processor","AMD cores","MPI library","Intel MIC architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel batch pattern training","recirculation neural network","parallelization efficiency","many-core system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient parallelization of batch pattern training algorithm on many-core and cluster architectures","isConference":true,"volume":"02","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13899739","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663014/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663014/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient parallelization of batch pattern training algorithm on many-core and cluster architectures","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"692698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064317S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653329","isNumber":"6662970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653329","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6662970","articleId":"6663014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663018,"authors":[{"name":"Vladislav Falfushinsky","affiliation":["V.M.

The iterative decoding approach based on the well known Extended-Min-Sum (EMS) algorithm, considered as the most efficient decoding algorithm to decode NB-LDPC codes, executes the decoding process iteratively. The main operations of this algorithm are the variable and check node updates which are performed at least eight times requiring a long decoding time to achieve good performance in terms of Frame Error Rate (FER). The proposed decoding near ML approach is based on ML search where the number of candidates is highly reduced using a technique privileging the most reliable and nearest codewords. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves, at a reduced list of 5 searched candidates in average at 3 dB, the performance offered by the EMS algorithm. We also show that by slightly increasing the list of candidates, the proposed algorithm outperforms the EMS algorithm.","publicationTitle":"2013 13th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th Mediterranean Microwave Symposium (MMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6646397/6663066/06663104.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMS.2013.6663104","doi":"10.1109/MMS.2013.6663104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding of iterative Non-Binary LDPC codes using a near Maximum Likelihood approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decoding of iterative Non-Binary LDPC codes using a near Maximum Likelihood approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663104/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663104/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898548","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding of iterative Non-Binary LDPC codes using a near Maximum Likelihood approach","confLoc":"Saida, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"paper254chamas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039592S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6646397","isNumber":"6663066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6646397","xplore-issue":"6663066","articleId":"6663104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6663142,"authors":[{"name":"Mouhammad Malli","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes (IETR), UMR CNRS, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Mouhammad","lastName":"Malli","id":"37086724995"},{"name":"Bachir Habib","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes (IETR), UMR CNRS, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Bachir","lastName":"Habib","id":"37948261200"},{"name":"Gheorghe Zaharia","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes (IETR), UMR CNRS, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Gheorghe","lastName":"Zaharia","id":"37273238700"},{"name":"Gha\u00efs El Zein","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes (IETR), UMR CNRS, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Gha\u00efs El","lastName":"Zein","id":"37658877100"},{"name":"Youssef Nasser","affiliation":["ECE Department, American University of Beirut (AUB), Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Nasser","id":"37294663300"},{"name":"Karim Kabalan","affiliation":["ECE Department, American University of Beirut (AUB), Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Kabalan","id":"37284078700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5820-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9822"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9830"}],"articleNumber":"6663142","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","MIMO","Hardware","Channel models","Standards","Finite impulse response filters","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital block implementation algorithm","MIMO channel hardware simulator","repeatable laboratory environment","LTE 802.11ac standard","WLAN 802.11ac standard","Doppler speed","Xilinx Virtex-IV FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware simulator","FPGA","MIMO channels","LTE","WLAN 802.11 ac","implementation algorithm"]}],"abstract":"The hardware simulator facilitates the test and validation cycles by replicating channel artifacts in a controllable and repeatable laboratory environment.

Data Security is the most critical issues in a cloud computing environment. Authentication is a key technology for information security, which is a mechanism to establish proof of identities to get access of information in the system. Traditional password authentication does not provide enough security for information in cloud computing environment to the most modern means of attacks. In this paper, we propose a new multi-factor authentication framework for cloud computing. The proposed framework provides a feasible and a most efficient mechanism which can closely integrate with the traditional authentication system.The proposed framework is verified by developing Cloud Access Management (CAM) system which authenticates the user based on multiple factors. Also using secret-splitting and encrypted value of arithmetic captcha is innovative factor for user authentication for cloud computing environment. Prototype model for cloud computing own cloud server is implemented using open sources technology. The proposed framework shows the close agreement with the standard criteria for security.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSim.2013.25","publicationTitle":"2013 Fifth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Modelling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fifth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Modelling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656125/6662531/06663171.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSim.2013.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-factor Authentication Framework for Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663171/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-factor Authentication Framework for Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13900131","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663171/","conferenceDate":"24-25 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-factor Authentication Framework for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"5155a105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086872S","chronDate":"24-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656125","isNumber":"6662531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656125","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6662531","articleId":"6663171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663173,"authors":[{"name":"Mat Hussin Ab Talib","firstName":"Mat Hussin Ab","lastName":"Talib","id":"37087154347"},{"name":"Intan Z.

In this paper, a novel reliable and energy efficient MAC protocol for cognitive radio adhoc networks has been proposed which selects the best data channel(s) with respect to the channel ranking to reduce the additional overhead at the control packets.

With our proposed methodology that is based on the Bayesian networking model we examined the effects of flit buffer depth, flit data width and virtual channel parameters through an extensive experimentation and simulation for scalable and adaptive NoC on Xilinx Virtex7 FPGA device. To demonstrate the flexibility and extensible design space coverage of our methodology, we design and present hardware synthesis results of 96 different NoCs configurations. We used a cycle accurate simulation system and drive the NoCs with four different traffic patterns and varying number of virtual channels (VCs) and show the resulting load-delay curves. Our results show that, for scalable and adaptive NoC, the flit data width and flit buffer depth parameters have the largest impact on FPGA area and clock frequency. We show that these parameters need to be properly adjusted for better run-time performance of the FPGA. Moreover, the neighbor traffic pattern with 4 VCs offer the best performance with 95% throughput, low latency and efficient silicon area in both Mesh and Torus networks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Table lookup","Adaptation models","System-on-chip","Bayes methods","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit modelling","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["torus network","mesh network","neighbor traffic pattern","clock frequency","adaptive NoC","load-delay curves","NoC configuration","hardware synthesis","extensible design space coverage","Xilinx Virtex7 FPGA device","virtual channel parameters","flit data width","flit buffer depth","Bayesian networking model","field programmable gate array","self-adaptive scheme","network-on-chip parameters","adaptive FPGA-based network-on-chips","scalable FPGA-based network-on-chips","NoC parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","Self-Adaptability","Network-on-chip (NoC)","Flit Data Width (FDW)","Flit Buffer Depth (FBD)","Virtual Channel (VC)."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663211","doi":"10.1109/CIMSim.2013.65","startPage":"364","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"2013 Fifth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Modelling and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fifth International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Modelling and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656125/6662531/06663211.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6662531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSim.2013.65","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663211/","displayDocTitle":"Examining the Performance Impact of NoC Parameters for Scalable and Adaptive FPGA-Based Network-on-Chips","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13914718","htmlLink":"/document/6663211/","conferenceDate":"24-25 Sept. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Examining the Performance Impact of NoC Parameters for Scalable and Adaptive FPGA-Based Network-on-Chips","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"5155a364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129157S","chronDate":"24-25 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656125","isNumber":"6662531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656125","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6662531","articleId":"6663211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6663215,"authors":[{"name":"Chetinderpal Singh","affiliation":["SBSSTC Ferozepur, Punjab, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6656125/6662531/6663215/6663215-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chetinderpal Singh is pursuing his research work under the supervision of Amit Grover, Assistant Professor, Department of ECE, Shaheed Bhagat Singh State Technical Campus, Moga road, Ferozepur, Punjab, India.

It is also claimed to provide security against scan-based side-channel attacks. This paper pursues the legitimacy of this claim and presents scan attack vulnerabilities of test compression schemes used in commercial electronic design automation tools. A publicly available advanced encryption standard design is used and test compression structures provided by Synopsys, Cadence, and Mentor Graphics design for testability tools are inserted into the design. Experimental results of the differential scan attacks employed in this paper suggest that tools using X-masking and X-tolerance are vulnerable and leak information about the secret key. Differential scan attacks on these schemes have been demonstrated to have a best case success rate of 94.22% and 74.94%, respectively, for a random scan design. On the other hand, time compaction seems to be the strongest choice with the best case success rate of 3.55%. In addition, similar attacks are also performed on existing scan attack countermeasures proposed in the literature, thus experimentally evaluating their practical security. Finally, a suitable countermeasure is proposed and compared to the previously proposed countermeasures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663238/","volume":"32","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6663238/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13914433","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Security Analysis of Industrial Test Compression Schemes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Analysis of Industrial Test Compression Schemes","sourcePdf":"tcad-das-2274619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091849S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6663223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6663223","articleId":"6663238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663239,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Joon Lee","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6663223/6663239/6663239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-Joon Lee (S'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2013.","His current research interests include monolithic 3-D integrated circuit (IC) design automation, timing optimization, and low-power design techniques for through-silicon-via-based 3-D ICs, and co-optimization of traditional metrics and reliability metrics on 3-D ICs."]},"firstName":"Young-Joon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539806600"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Lim","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6663223/6663239/6663239-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Sung Kyu Lim (S'94\u2013M'00\u2013SM'05) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), CA, USA, in 1994, 1997, and 2000, respectively.","From 2000 to 2001, he was a Post-Doctoral Scholar at UCLA, and a Senior Engineer at Aplus Design Technologies, Inc., Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Formally verifying the assertions defined over such deeply embedded portions of the logic is challenging because formal methods do not scale to the size of the entire logic. Verifying the assertion on the embedded logic in isolation typically throws up a large number of counterexamples, many of which are spurious because the scenarios they depict are not possible in the entire logic. In this paper, we introduce the notion of ranking the counterexamples so that only the most likely counterexamples are presented to the designer. Our ranking is based on assume properties mined from simulation traces of the entire logic. We define a metric to compute a belief for each assume property that is mined, and rank counterexamples based on their relationships with the mined assume properties. Experimental results demonstrate a remarkable correlation between the real counterexamples (if they exist) and the proposed ranking metric, thereby establishing the proposed method as a very promising verification approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayes methods","Formal verification","Simulation","Decision trees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","embedded systems","formal verification","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["counterexample ranking","mined invariants","bug fixing","formal methods","embedded logic","logic design","ranking metric","formal verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayes methods","decision trees","formal verification","simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2276627","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6663223/06663245.pdf","startPage":"1978","endPage":"1991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2013.2276627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Counterexample Ranking Using Mined Invariants","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Counterexample Ranking Using Mined Invariants","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663245/","volume":"32","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663245/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13914434","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 November 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Counterexample Ranking Using Mined Invariants","sourcePdf":"tcad-banerjee-2276627-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082457S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6663223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6663223","articleId":"6663245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663392,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A new frame structure for OFDM, consisting of a known preamble, cyclic prefix and data is proposed. A filter that is matched to the preamble is used for start-of-frame (SoF) detection. A two-step ML detector for frequency-offset estimation is proposed, which has a much lower complexity compared to the single step ML detector. Turbo decoding and data interleaving is used to significantly enhance the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the coherent receiver. Simulation results show that the BER performance of the practical coherent receiver is close to the ideal coherent receiver, for data length equal to the preamble length, and attains a BER of about 4\u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n at an SNR of just 8 dB.

For an X-band Airborne Radar where resolution requirement is not sub-metric, Range-Doppler algorithm is the preferred choice to generate ISAR images due to small rotation angle requirement. In addition when both the radar platform and target are expected to move at nearly steady course and speed within the image formation interval, the use of highly sophisticated motion compensation algorithms is not desirable. This paper presents a robust and computationally efficient algorithm for translational motion compensation based on batch profile correlation. The algorithm is robust to background noise and target scintillation effects. It removes the problem of error accumulation inherent in peak-tracking method and avoids limitation of range-shift in integer steps. The effectiveness of the approach is verified by applying the algorithm to simulated ISAR data as well as actual ISAR data collected by an X-band airborne radar. The ISAR data simulation and processing are carried out using MATLAB. Different noise levels and target amplitude fluctuation are added to the simulated ISAR data to test the robustness of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISPCC.2013.6663410","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6636397/6663377/06663410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCC.2013.6663410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663377","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust motion compensation algorithm for ISAR imaging of sea-surface targets by Airborne Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A robust motion compensation algorithm for ISAR imaging of sea-surface targets by Airborne Radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663410/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898028","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663410/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust motion compensation algorithm for ISAR imaging of sea-surface targets by Airborne Radar","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"39SP.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05025S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6636397","isNumber":"6663377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6636397","xplore-issue":"6663377","articleId":"6663410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663413,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak Joshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engg, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37605532900"},{"name":"Shiv Dutt Joshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engg, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shiv Dutt","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37273462600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6190-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6188-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663413","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663413","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Feature extraction","Training","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Data models","Speech processing","Vector quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","gender issues","information retrieval","natural language processing","pattern classification","sampling methods","speaker recognition","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["language identification system","sampling rate compensation","Indian languages","sampling rate variation","training language data","test language data","gender based language models","speaker gender identification","gender information extraction","gender based user classification","customized gender based services","vector quantization codebook","Gaussian mixture model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sampling rate compensation","vector quantisation","Gaussian Mixture modelling","Gender based language models"]}],"abstract":"In today's world of emerging technology, a Language identification system may get a test language sample from various sources like Landline or Mobile telephone call, VoIP packet, radio transmission, sample recorded on a computer etc. Often, there is a variation between the sampling rate of the test language sample and the training samples used for language models in the back end. This difference leads to deterioration in the performance of the system. Hence, there is a requirement to carry out sampling rate compensation. It is proposed to introduce a sampling rate compensation block in the language identification system. Sampling rate compensation ensures that the system is independent of the effects of sampling rate variation between the test and training language data. Also, it is proposed to use gender based language models. This approach has better performance in terms of language identification task and it also gives the gender of the speaker. Gender information extracted is useful when gender based user classification is being carried out or while providing customized gender based services. This technique of gender based language identification along with sampling rate compensation has been found to improve results for both the Vector Quantization codebook and Gaussian Mixture Model for languages.

This paper analyses how impulsive noise affects the PLC communication's performance from a theoretical and simulation point of view and proposes a signal processing method to enhance its robustness. Authors focus on a popular narrowband PLC solution to evaluate the improvement: PRIME. A simulation framework based on Matlab was developed to assess PRIME's behaviour in an impulsive noise environment. In order to recreate a realistic scenario, narrowband noise parameters reported in the literature are used in a Middleton's Class-A noise model. The performance is measured in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) as a function of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Additionally, compressive sensing (CS) techniques are proposed as a method to improve PRIME's performance in such environment. The application of this technique has only been proposed for broadband PLC technologies in the literature before. Results from simulations report an SNR gain of 9dB for the most robust communication mode. Moreover, since no modification is required in the transmitted signal, the proposed CS configuration can be applied to already existing systems and it is backwards compatible.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6636397/6663377/06663426.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISPCC.2013.6663426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCC.2013.6663426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing techniques applied to narrowband Power Line Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","OFDM","Mathematical model","Compressed sensing","Vectors","Noise measurement","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","compressed sensing","impulse noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing techniques","narrowband power line communications","impulsive noise sources","transmission line","PLC communication","signal processing method","PRIME","simulation framework","Matlab","impulsive noise environment","narrowband noise parameters","Middleton's Class-A noise model","bit error rate","signal to noise ratio","broadband PLC technologies","transmitted signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing techniques applied to narrowband Power Line Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663426/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898065","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing techniques applied to narrowband Power Line Communications","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"53NC.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074175S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6636397","isNumber":"6663377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6636397","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6663377","articleId":"6663426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6663428,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Kumar Arya","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication Engineering Jaypee, University of Engineering and Technology, Guna, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep Kumar","lastName":"Arya","id":"38192328800"},{"name":"Ashutosh Kumar Singh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication Engineering Jaypee, University of Engineering and Technology, Guna, India"],"firstName":"Ashutosh Kumar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37534701500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6190-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6188-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663428","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Time-frequency analysis","Doppler effect","Frequency division multiplexing","Standards","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference","ICI analysis","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","FRFT-OFDM","doubly selective fading channels","frequency selective fading channel","frequency offset","signal-to-interference ratio","optimal fractional factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FRFT","OFDM","ICI","carrier frequency offset","doubly selective fading"]}],"abstract":"Frequency offset affects the performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system.

Cognitive Radio (CR) users improve spectrum efficiency by opportunistic spectrum access when the licensed spectrum is not occupied by the primary users (PUs). CR users also need to sense the spectrum and vacate the channel upon the detection of the PU's presence to protect PUs from harmful interference. To achieve these fundamental CR functions, CR users usually coordinate with each other by using a common medium for control message exchange ensuring a priority of PUs over CR users. This paper presents the Vacate on Demand (VD) algorithm which enables dynamic spectrum access and ensures to vacate the assigned channel in case of PU activity and move the CR user to some other vacant channel to make spectrum available to PUs as well as to CR users. The basic idea is to use a ranking table of the available channels based on the PU activity detected on each channel. The VD algorithm is characterized by two features: (a) vacate the assigned channel in case of PU activity, (b) move the CR user to some other vacant channel in minimum possible time. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through analysis and MATLAB simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISPCC.2013.6663430","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6636397/6663377/06663430.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCC.2013.6663430","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vacate on demand algorithm in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Vacate on demand algorithm in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663430/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663430/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898033","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vacate on demand algorithm in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"57NC.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03625S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6636397","isNumber":"6663377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6636397","xplore-issue":"6663377","articleId":"6663430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6663434,"authors":[{"name":"Ravinder Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"],"firstName":"Ravinder","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37066076300"},{"name":"Anshul Tyagi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee"],"firstName":"Anshul","lastName":"Tyagi","id":"37418075000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6190-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6188-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663434","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Encoding","Cognitive radio","Fourier transforms","Peak to average power ratio","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","encoding","OFDM modulation","polynomials","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sidelobe suppression","differential coding","OFDM cognitive radios","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transmission technique","out-of-band leakage","spectral sidelobes","polynomial-cancellation-coding","data symbol","information source","unequal probabilities","in-band spectrum leakage","out-of-band spectrum leakage"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a recognized transmission technique for Cognitive radio (CR) systems but one of the major drawback of OFDM scheme is its out-of-band (OOB) leakage due to high spectral sidelobes.

The concept working behind the scheme is polynomial-cancellation-coding (PCC) in which one data symbol is transmitted on group of subcarriers. The proposed scheme have advantageous results when information source produces symbols with unequal probabilities which may be the case in practical transmission. Unlike to the basic PCC scheme, the proposed technique does not affect the throughput of the system. The technique is very simple to implement.

It assuages the problem of spectrum scarcity, which is a major concern as many applications and devices nowadays are using wireless medium. Before carrying on any transmission, the SU senses the licensed spectrum and predicts whether the spectrum is preoccupied by PU. Access strategy selection is a very crucial issue for CR networks, because the SU needs to satisfy the interference constraint caused to the PU as well as the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.

Conventional back propagation algorithm is used to train the networks.","doi":"10.1109/ISPCC.2013.6663450","pdfPath":"/iel7/6636397/6663377/06663450.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Computing and Control (ISPCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCC.2013.6663450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple classifiers systems with granular neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multiple classifiers systems with granular neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13914537","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663450/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple classifiers systems with granular neural networks","confLoc":"Solan, India","sourcePdf":"75AINN.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064349S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6636397","isNumber":"6663377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6636397","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6663377","articleId":"6663450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663503,"authors":[{"name":"Amr Rizk","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"Rizk","id":"38577595200"},{"name":"Zdravko Bozakov","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"],"firstName":"Zdravko","lastName":"Bozakov","id":"37543001600"},{"name":"Markus Fidler","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Fidler","id":"37268474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-55-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663503","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","estimation theory","Internet","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic correlation estimation","active network probing","Hurst parameter","Internet traffic traces","network performance","logging speed","storage capacity","passive monitoring","intersample distributions","sampling intensity","network utilization","estimation accuracy","lightweight traffic sampling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663503","abstract":"An extensive body of research deals with estimating the correlation and the Hurst parameter of Internet traffic traces. The significance of these statistics is due to their fundamental impact on network performance. The coverage of Internet traffic traces is, however, limited since acquiring such traces is challenging with respect to, e.g., confidentiality, logging speed, and storage capacity. In this work, we investigate how the correlation of Internet traffic can be reliably estimated from random traffic samples. These samples are observed either by passive monitoring within the network, or otherwise by active packet probes at end systems. We analyze random sampling processes with different inter-sample distributions and show how to obtain asymptotically unbiased estimates from these samples. We quantify the inherent limitations that are due to limited observations and explore the influence of various parameters, such as sampling intensity, network utilization, or Hurst parameter on the estimation accuracy. We design an active probing method which enables simple and lightweight traffic sampling without support from the network. We verify our approach in a controlled network environment and present comprehensive Internet measurements. We find that the correlation exhibits properties such as long range dependence as well as periodicities and that it differs significantly across Internet paths and observation times.","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Networking Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656124/6663488/06663503.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IFIP Networking Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating traffic correlations from sampling and active network probing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Estimating traffic correlations from sampling and active network probing","conferenceDate":"22-24 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663503/","accessionNumber":"13900047","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663503/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating traffic correlations from sampling and active network probing","confLoc":"Brooklyn, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"1569698159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150934S","chronDate":"22-24 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656124","isNumber":"6663488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656124","xplore-issue":"6663488","articleId":"6663503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IFIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6663536,"authors":[{"name":"Lothar Braun","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Lothar","lastName":"Braun","id":"37391755600"},{"name":"Cornelius Diekmann","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Cornelius","lastName":"Diekmann","id":"37085627089"},{"name":"Nils Kammenhuber","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Kammenhuber","id":"37974582900"},{"name":"Georg Carle","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Carle","id":"37297186600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-901882-55-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663536","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663536","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Algorithm design and analysis","Hardware","Instruction sets","Packet loss","Payloads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inspection","Internet","performance evaluation","security of data","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive load-aware sampling","multicore commodity hardware","traffic monitoring systems","deep packet inspection","DPI","intrusion detection systems","network traffic accounting","traffic classification","service level agreements","ISP networks","traffic payload","multicore-aware network traffic analysis","network monitoring tools","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"Many current traffic monitoring systems employ deep packet inspection (DPI) in order to analyze network traffic.

Our algorithm adapts its sampling rate according to the network traffic currently observed, and the number of packets that a monitoring application is able to process.

Scaling function of Daubechies wavelet is chosen for fields expansion, and iterative formulas of MRTD method are derivated in 2-D cylindrical coordinates. First, three double-exponential lightning channel-base current with different rise times have been used for evaluating performance of the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. And then, LEMP of different distances of the lightning channel were calculated with the MRTD method. We examined the MRTD method by comparing the results obtained with the FDTD method. Numerical simulation results show that the MRTD method and FDTD method are consistent with each other for first return stroke, even with a larger grid division. However, for subsequent return stroke, oscillations will be observed in the late response of the waveforms calculated by the FDTD method. Comparing with the FDTD method, the MRTD method suffers less oscillations with the same grid division, and can significantly save both computational memory and CPU time with large gird mesh, as well as good numerical dispersion property.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/6777639/06663605.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2013.2288313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2013.2288313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiresolution Time-Domain Method for LEMP Calculation and Comparison With FDTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Lightning","Mathematical model","Conductivity","Erbium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic fields","electromagnetic pulse","finite difference time-domain analysis","lightning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution time-domain method","MRTD method","finite difference time-domain method","FDTD","lightning electromagnetic pulse calculation","lemp calculation","Daubechies wavelet","iterative formulas","2D cylindrical coordinates","double-exponential lightning channel-base current","return stroke","grid division","computational memory","CPU time","grid mesh"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time domain (FDTD)","lightning","lightning electromagnetic pulse (LEMP)","multiresolution time domain (MRTD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Multiresolution Time-Domain Method for LEMP Calculation and Comparison With FDTD","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6663605/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14196265","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiresolution Time-Domain Method for LEMP Calculation and Comparison With FDTD","sourcePdf":"temc-jiang-2288313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111402S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6777639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6777639","articleId":"6663605","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6663619,"authors":[{"name":"P.

These problems are usually difficult to solve, and often require iterative optimization. The objective of this paper is to provide an efficient and simplified design approach to multi-band filters (including low-pass filters or high-pass filters) as well as full-band differentiators. The proposed method does not require frequency sampling and iterative optimization to compute the coefficients of the filters or that of the differentiators. The magnitude and phase specifications are simultaneously approximated, and the errors in the specified frequency bands are controlled by using frequency-weighting factors. In addition, a maximum pole radius, which corresponds to a stability margin, can be specified to robustly ensure the stability of the filters or the differentiators. To evaluate the efficiency of proposed method, we compare the proposed method with several established methods. Simulation results show that, although the propose method does not utilize frequency sampling and iterative optimization, the designed filters and differentiators have sufficient performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2290765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2290765","startPage":"4857","endPage":"4866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6777358/06663628.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Multi-Band Digital Filters and Full-Band Digital Differentiators Without Frequency Sampling and Iterative Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Design of Multi-Band Digital Filters and Full-Band Digital Differentiators Without Frequency Sampling and Iterative Optimization","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2014","volume":"61","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"14181304","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663628/","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Design of Multi-Band Digital Filters and Full-Band Digital Differentiators Without Frequency Sampling and Iterative Optimization","sourcePdf":"tie-nakamoto-2290765-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033767S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","isNumber":"6777358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"18","articleId":"6663628","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6663629,"authors":[{"name":"Can Ding","affiliation":["Computational Informatics, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Marsfield, N.S.W., Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6729042/6663629/6663629-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Can Ding (S'13) was born in Anhui Province, China, in 1989.

The phase shifter consists of a number of cascaded reconfigurable defected microstrip structure (DMS) units. Each DMS unit is made by etching a slot in a microstrip line and loading the slot with PIN diodes. The \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d states of the PIN diodes in the DMS unit provide the phase shifts by changing the current paths. Analyses on the performance of various phase shifters cascading different numbers of DMS units are conducted by both simulations and experiments. Using the proposed phase-shifter units and Wilkinson power dividers, a four-element beam-steering antenna array was designed, fabricated, and tested. Experimental results agree well with the simulated ones. The proposed antenna array employing DMS-based phase shifters offers a low-cost solution to beamforming in wireless communications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2290802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729042","startPage":"641","endPage":"651","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6729042/06663629.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Defected Microstrip Structure (DMS)-Based Phase Shifter and Its Application to Beamforming Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663629/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Defected Microstrip Structure (DMS)-Based Phase Shifter and Its Application to Beamforming Antennas","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14078942","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Defected Microstrip Structure (DMS)-Based Phase Shifter and Its Application to Beamforming Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-ding-2290802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087085S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6729042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6729042","articleId":"6663629","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6663636,"authors":[{"name":"Borja Gonzalez-Valdes","affiliation":["Universidad de Vigo"],"bio":{"p":["Borja Gonzales-Valdez, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Borja","lastName":"Gonzalez-Valdes","id":"38274282300"},{"name":"Gregory Allan","affiliation":["ALERT Center, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Gregory Allan, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Allan","id":"37085629435"},{"name":"Yolanda Rodriguez-Vaqueiro","affiliation":["ALERT Center, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yolanda Rodriguez-Vaqueiro, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Yolanda","lastName":"Rodriguez-Vaqueiro","id":"38328605100"},{"name":"Yuri \u00c1lvarez","affiliation":["Area of Signal Theory and Communications, Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad de Oviedo, Gij\u00f3n, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Yuri \u00c1lvarez, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Yuri","lastName":"\u00c1lvarez","id":"37400677700"},{"name":"Spiros Mantzavinos","affiliation":["ALERT Center, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Spiros Mantzavinos, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Spiros","lastName":"Mantzavinos","id":"37085699177"},{"name":"Matt Nickerson","affiliation":["ALERT Center, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Matt Nickerson, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Nickerson","id":"37088713322"},{"name":"Ben Berkowitz","affiliation":["ALERT Center, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ben Berkowitz, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Berkowitz","id":"37088710080"},{"name":"J.

The LDN takes the form of a half-bridge inverter to almost double the number of output voltage levels. The concept (of the proposed LDN) has the capability of self-balancing during positive and negative cycles without any closed-loop control/algorithm, and it does not consume or supply any power. The topology uses a symmetric cascaded H-bridge MLI but offers an equivalent performance of an asymmetric topology in terms of the number of levels. Also, it maintains the merit of uniform loading of the individual cell for a symmetric MLI. The topology is implemented by connecting only a three-arm H-bridge (only two switches per phase) with the entire three-phase inverter to double the number of levels. Thus, it significantly improves the power quality, reduces the switching frequency, and reduces the cost and size of the power filter. Operation of the circuit is verified by simulation result and experiments from a laboratory prototype.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2290751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6777358/06663651.pdf","startPage":"4622","endPage":"4631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2290751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Multilevel Inverter Topology With Self-Balancing Level Doubling Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663651","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663651/","displayDocTitle":"A New Multilevel Inverter Topology With Self-Balancing Level Doubling Network","volume":"61","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14181272","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663651/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Multilevel Inverter Topology With Self-Balancing Level Doubling Network","sourcePdf":"tie-chattopadhyay-2290751-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122261S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6777358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6777358","articleId":"6663651","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6663655,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Zeng","affiliation":["Signal Information and Processing Lab, Delft University of Technology, Delft, CD, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/6663728/6663655/6663655-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Zeng obtained her M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, in 2010 She is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the signal and information processing lab, Delft University of Technology.

In a randomly connected wireless acoustic sensor network, the DDSB estimates the desired signal at each node by communicating only with its neighbors. We first provide the asynchronous DDSB (ADDSB) where each pair of neighboring nodes updates its data asynchronously. Then, we introduce an improved general distributed synchronous averaging (IGDSA) algorithm, which can be used in any connected network, and combine that with the DDSB algorithm where multiple node pairs can update their estimates simultaneously. For convergence analysis, we first provide bounds for the worst case averaging time of the ADDSB for the best and worst connected networks, and then we compare the convergence rate of the ADDSB with the original synchronous DDSB (OSDDSB) and the improved synchronous DDSB (ISDDSB) in regular networks. This convergence rate comparison is extended to randomly connected non-regular networks using simulations. The simulation results show that the DDSB using the different updating schemes converges to the optimal estimates of the centralized beamformer and that the proposed IGDSA algorithm converges much faster than the original synchronous communication scheme, in particular for non-regular networks. Moreover, comparisons are performed with several existing distributed speech enhancement methods from literature, assuming that the steering vector is given. In the simulated scenario, the proposed method leads to a slight performance improvement at the expense of a higher communication cost. The presented method is not constrained to a certain network topology (e.g., tree connected or fully connected), while this is the case for many of the reference methods.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2013.2290861","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/6663728/06663655.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663728","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2013.2290861","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","startPage":"260","endPage":"273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Delay and Sum Beamformer for Speech Enhancement via Randomized Gossip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Delay and Sum Beamformer for Speech Enhancement via Randomized Gossip","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663655/","volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6663655/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13968939","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Delay and Sum Beamformer for Speech Enhancement via Randomized Gossip","sourcePdf":"taslp-zeng-2290861-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111484S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6663728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6663728","articleId":"6663655","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6663667,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Fuchs","affiliation":["IETR/University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6729042/6663667/6663667-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Benjamin Fuchs (S'06\u2013M'08) received the M.S. and electrical engineering degrees in 2004 from the National Institute of Applied Science of Rennes, France.

The design targets at improving bandwidth efficiency by reducing the amount of overheads (e.g., guard time intervals, training/pilot symbols) typically associated with SIMO-OFDM UWA communications. The design consists of three key components: preamble-based parameter estimation that exploits full knowledge of the preamble; time-reversal-based symbol detection that enables the use of short guard time intervals for interblock interference avoidance; and decision-directed (DD) channel tracking with error propagation (EP) control that eliminates the need of periodic training for channel tracking. The proposed design is analyzed and tested at a seagoing experiment. The experimental results confirm the merits of our design and demonstrate considerable improvements over a competing alternative.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Overhead Reduction in Time-Reversed OFDM Underwater Acoustic Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2013.2285658","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/6913587/06663684.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2013.2285658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6913587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663684/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"On Overhead Reduction in Time-Reversed OFDM Underwater Acoustic Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6663684/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14663590","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Overhead Reduction in Time-Reversed OFDM Underwater Acoustic Communications","sourcePdf":"joe-liu-2285658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123476S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6913587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6913587","articleId":"6663684","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6663689,"authors":[{"name":"Kedar Janardan Dhori","affiliation":["Technology Research and Development, STMicroelectronics Pvt.

By exploiting channel temporal correlations, the proposed scheme incorporates a matched-filter (MF) combining vector into the beamformer design and enhances the performance of conventional signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) beamforming. With imperfect channel state information (CSI) available at the transmitter, we then focus on improving the robustness of the proposed algorithm against the mismatched CSI. The feedback delay effect is considered in the beamformer design first. We design a statistically robust beamforming design by maximizing the conditional expectation of the SLNR, hence alleviating the performance degradation due to CSI errors. Following that, we further encompass the imperfection caused by the quantized feedback into the beamforming design.

For embedded memories, built-in redundancy analysis (BIRA) is widely used to improve yield by replacing faulty cells with a 2-D redundancy architecture. However, the most important factor in BIRA is the reduction of hardware overhead while keeping optimal repair rate. Most BIRA approaches require extra hardware overhead in order to store and analyze faults in the memory. These approaches do not utilize spare memories during the redundancy analysis (RA) procedure. However, the proposed BIRA minimizes area overhead by utilizing a part of the spare memory as an address mapping table (AMT). Since storing the faulty memory addresses take most of the extra hardware overhead, the reduced logical addresses produced by the AMT are used to reduce the extra hardware overhead. In addition, the reduced addresses are stored in content-addressable memories (CAMs) and used in the RA procedure. The proposed BIRA can achieve an optimal repair rate by using an exhaustive search RA algorithm. The proposed RA algorithm compares the repair solution candidates with all the fault addresses stored in the proposed CAMs to guarantee an exhaustive search. The experimental results show that the proposed BIRA requires a smaller area overhead than that of the previous state-of-the-art BIRA with an optimal repair rate.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2288637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6932540/06663698.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2288637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6932540","startPage":"2336","endPage":"2349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A BIRA for Memories With an Optimal Repair Rate Using Spare Memories for Area Reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A BIRA for Memories With an Optimal Repair Rate Using Spare Memories for Area Reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663698/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14686971","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6663698/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Korean government","grantNumber":"2010-0024707"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A BIRA for Memories With an Optimal Repair Rate Using Spare Memories for Area Reduction","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-kang-2288637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106212S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6932540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6932540","articleId":"6663698","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6663700,"authors":[{"name":"Saraju P.

Through accurate simulations it is shown that process variations have a drastic effect on performance metrics such as the center frequency of the VCO. In the presence of worst-case process variation, performance optimization of the VCO is applied, along with a dual-oxide technique for power minimization. The final product of the proposed process-variation aware methodology is an optimal physical design. The proposed methodology achieves 25% power reduction (including leakage) with only 1% degradation in center frequency compared to the target, in the presence of worst-case process variation and parasitics, with a 41% area penalty.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSM.2013.2291112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729094","startPage":"22","endPage":"31","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel7/66/6729094/06663700.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating Manufacturing Process Variation Awareness in Fast Design Optimization of Nanoscale CMOS VCOs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663700/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Incorporating Manufacturing Process Variation Awareness in Fast Design Optimization of Nanoscale CMOS VCOs","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14078898","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating Manufacturing Process Variation Awareness in Fast Design Optimization of Nanoscale CMOS VCOs","sourcePdf":"tsm-mohanty-2291112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129791S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"6729094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6729094","articleId":"6663700","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6663705,"authors":[{"name":"Huanqing Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6786374/6663705/wang-2283879-small.gif","p":["Huanqing Wang received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2003, the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Inner Mongolia University, Huhhot, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China, in 2013.","He is currently a Lecturer with the College of Mathematics and Physics, Bohai University.

To overcome the design difficulty of nonstrict-feedback structure, variable separation technique is used to decompose the unknown functions of all state variables into a sum of smooth functions of each error dynamic. By combining radial basis function neural networks' universal approximation capability with an adaptive backstepping technique, an adaptive neural control algorithm is proposed. It is shown that the proposed controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system are four-moment semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the tracking error eventually converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in the sense of mean quartic value.

Complete processor cores on an FPGA use 17-27 \u00d7 more area (\u201carea ratio\u201d) than the same design implemented in custom CMOS. Building blocks with dedicated hardware support on FPGAs such as SRAMs, adders, and multipliers are particularly area-efficient (2-7\u00d7), while multiplexers and content-addressable memories (CAM) are particularly area-inefficient (>100\u00d7).

The PLL is used to synchronize the phase of the load voltage to a grid voltage in grid-connected operation, and to generate an angle with the desired frequency in islanding operation. The stability of both the grid current loop for grid-connected operation and the load voltage control loop for islanding operation is analyzed. The phase and magnitude of the load voltage are successively matched to the grid voltage for a seamless transfer from islanding to grid-connected operation. When grid voltage sag occurs, an operating sequence including a PLL operation is suggested in order to transfer smoothly to islanding operation and to provide a stable and seamless voltage to a sensitive load under the voltage sag condition.

One of the basic functions of any CR is spectrum sensing. Most existing works on spectrum sensing consider the Gaussian noise assumption. In practice, this assumption is not always valid since several existing noise types exhibit non-Gaussian and impulsive behavior. Hence, it is very beneficial to study spectrum sensing in the presence of impulsive noise. In this paper, we propose two new multiple-antenna-based spectrum sensing methods, assuming that the underlying noise follows a symmetric \u03b1-stable distribution. This assumption is justified by a distribution fitting of some measurements of the noise acting on the GSM-R antennas onboard trains. The first proposed sensing method is based on the covariation properties of \u03b1-stable processes, whereas the second proposed method has the strategy of filtering the corrupted signals before applying a traditional spectrum sensing method. These two methods do not require a priori knowledge about the primary-user signal. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms provide good spectrum sensing performance in the presence of \u03b1-stable distributed impulsive noise.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2290839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6832681/06663719.pdf","startPage":"2248","endPage":"2257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2290839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Antenna-Based Blind Spectrum Sensing in the Presence of Impulsive Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663719/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Antenna-Based Blind Spectrum Sensing in the Presence of Impulsive Noise","volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2014","accessionNumber":"14379476","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663719/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"International Campus on Safety and Intermodality in Transportation (CISIT) and the COgnitive Radio for RaIlway through Dynamic and Opportunistic spectrum Reuse (CORRIDOR) project"},{"fundingName":"French Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region"},{"fundingName":"European Community"},{"fundingName":"French Ministry of Research"},{"fundingName":"National Research Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Antenna-Based Blind Spectrum Sensing in the Presence of Impulsive Noise","sourcePdf":"tvt-hassan-2290839-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081894S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6663719","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6663722,"authors":[{"name":"Eugenio Magistretti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6985690/6663722/6663722-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eugenio Magistretti (S'04) received the Laurea and Doctorate degrees from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2003 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, in 2013, all in computer engineering.","His main research interests are in the area of wireless MAC protocols, with a focus on design, performance modeling, and evaluation."]},"firstName":"Eugenio","lastName":"Magistretti","id":"37423416900"},{"name":"Omer Gurewitz","affiliation":["Department of Communication Systems Engineering, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/6985690/6663722/6663722-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Omer Gurewitz (S'00\u2013M'05) received the B.Sc. degree in physics from Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel, in 1991, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","He is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Communication Systems Engineering, Ben Gurion University.

The use of correlatable symbol sequences provides two key advantages: 1) efficiency, as it permits a near order of magnitude reduction of the control time; 2) robustness, because codes are short and easily detectable even at low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and even while a neighbor is transmitting data. We implement 802.11ec on a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based software defined radio. We perform a large number of experiments and show that, compared to 802.11 (with and without RTS/CTS), 802.11ec achieves a vast efficiency gain in conveying control information and resolves key throughput and fairness problems in the presence of hidden terminals, asymmetric topologies, and general multihop topologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","volume":"22","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"14823996","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663722/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"802.11ec: Collision Avoidance Without Control Messages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"802.11ec: Collision Avoidance Without Control Messages","sourcePdf":"tnet-magistretti-2288365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0852S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6985690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6985690","articleId":"6663722","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6663723,"authors":[{"name":"Sema Candemir","affiliation":["Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications U.

A critical component in the computer-aided diagnosis of digital CXRs is the automatic detection of the lung regions. In this paper, we present a nonrigid registration-driven robust lung segmentation method using image retrieval-based patient specific adaptive lung models that detects lung boundaries, surpassing state-of-the-art performance. The method consists of three main stages: 1) a content-based image retrieval approach for identifying training images (with masks) most similar to the patient CXR using a partial Radon transform and Bhattacharyya shape similarity measure, 2) creating the initial patient-specific anatomical model of lung shape using SIFT-flow for deformable registration of training masks to the patient CXR, and 3) extracting refined lung boundaries using a graph cuts optimization approach with a customized energy function. Our average accuracy of 95.4% on the public JSRT database is the highest among published results. A similar degree of accuracy of 94.1% and 91.7% on two new CXR datasets from Montgomery County, MD, USA, and India, respectively, demonstrates the robustness of our lung segmentation approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6729093/06663723.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2013.2290491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2013.2290491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lung Segmentation in Chest Radiographs Using Anatomical Atlases With Nonrigid Registration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lungs","X-ray imaging","Image segmentation","Shape","Computational modeling","Databases","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnostic radiography","diseases","feature extraction","image registration","image retrieval","image segmentation","lung","medical image processing","optimisation","Radon transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chest radiographs","anatomical atlases","nonrigid registration","CXR datasets","degree-of-accuracy","public JSRT database","customized energy function","graph cuts optimization approach","refined lung boundaries extraction","deformable registration","initial patient-specific anatomical model","Bhattacharyya shape similarity","partial Radon transform","training images","content-based image retrieval approach","state-of-the-art performance","lung boundaries detection","image retrieval-based patient specific adaptive lung models","nonrigid registration-driven robust lung segmentation","automatic lung region detection","computer-aided diagnosis","tuberculosis detection","resource constrained communities","digital chest X-ray screening system","National Library-of-Medicine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chest X-ray imaging","computer-aided detection","image registration","image segmentation","tuberculosis (TB)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Databases, Factual","Humans","Lung","Models, Biological","Radiographic Image Enhancement","Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Radiography, Thoracic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Lung Segmentation in Chest Radiographs Using Anatomical Atlases With Nonrigid Registration","volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6663723/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14077984","pubMedId":"24239990","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lung Segmentation in Chest Radiographs Using Anatomical Atlases With Nonrigid Registration","sourcePdf":"tmi-candemir-2290491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160561S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6729093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"6729093","articleId":"6663723","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":6663724,"authors":[{"name":"Junjie Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6740878/6663724/6663724-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junjie Hu received the Master of Engineering in control theory and control engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2010.

However, these new DERs may challenge the distribution grid due to insufficient capacity in peak hours. This paper aims to coordinate the valuable services and operation constraints of three actors: the EV owner, the Fleet operator (FO) and the Distribution system operator (DSO), considering the individual EV owner's driving requirement, the charging cost of EV and thermal limits of cables and transformers in the proposed market framework. Firstly, a theoretical market framework is described. Within this framework, FOs who represent their customer's (EV owners) interests will centrally guarantee the EV owners' driving requirements and procure the energy for their vehicles with lower cost. The congestion problem will be solved by a coordination between DSO and FOs through a distribution grid capacity market scheme. Then, a mathematical formulation of the market scheme is presented. Further, some case studies are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2013.2279007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2279007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6740878/06663724.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Charging of Electric Vehicles for Congestion Prevention in the Distribution Grid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Charging of Electric Vehicles for Congestion Prevention in the Distribution Grid","volume":"5","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663724/","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14111692","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663724/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Charging of Electric Vehicles for Congestion Prevention in the Distribution Grid","sourcePdf":"tsg-hu-2279007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085464S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6740878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"6740878","articleId":"6663724","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6663742,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Han Yang","affiliation":["Centre for Autonomous System (CAS), University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/6739146/6663742/6663742-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chia-Han Yang received the B.E.

A novel receiver based on minimum mean square error criteria is then proposed to exploit the even subcarriers to collect additional diversity and coding gains, leading to improved bit error rate performance.

We construct polar codes for the block Rayleigh fading channel with known channel side information (CSI) and for the Rayleigh channel with known channel distribution information (CDI). The construction of polar codes for the Rayleigh fading with known CSI allows them to work with any signal noise ratio (SNR). The rate of the codeword is adapted correspondingly. Polar codes for Rayleigh fading with known CDI suffer a penalty for not having complete information about the channel. The penalty, however, is small, about 1.3 dB. We perform simulations and compare the obtained results with the theoretical limits. We show that they are close to the theoretical limit. We compare polar codes with other good codes and the results show that long polar codes are closer to the limit.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.111113.132103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6692867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.111113.132103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6692867/06663750.pdf","startPage":"2352","endPage":"2355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar Codes for the Rayleigh Fading Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Polar Codes for the Rayleigh Fading Channel","volume":"17","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663750/","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13998141","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663750/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar Codes for the Rayleigh Fading Channel","sourcePdf":"2352-cl1312-santos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062479S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6692867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6692867","articleId":"6663750","onlineDate":"13 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6663753,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The DoF achievability problem is also NP-hard if each transmitter/receiver has at least three antennas, and is polynomial-time solvable if each transmitter/receiver has no more than two antennas. It was conjectured that for the special case of the symmetric network (where all the transmitters have the same number of antennas and all the receivers have the same number of antennas), polynomial-time algorithms might exist for these two problems. In this paper, we show that the conjecture holds only in a very limited sense.

The main contribution of this letter is the analytical performance evaluation of Spatial Modulation MIMO (SM-MIMO) systems over the keyhole channel. The closed-form Pairwise Error Probability (PEP) is derived with accuracy verified by simulations. Based on the PEP, the achievable diversity gain is extracted and shown to be no more than 1 under any configuration. In addition, a tight Average Bit Error Probability (ABEP) upper bound is given. Numerical results demonstrate that compared to independent fading scenarios, the keyhole channel causes a significant performance degradation to the SM-MIMO system. It is shown that SM-MIMO schemes outperforms Space-Time Block Code (STBC) and V-BLAST schemes over the keyhole channel. Therefore, among multiple antenna transmission schemes, SM-MIMO schemes are better choices for systems that may experience the keyhole effect. However, owing to the inherent unfitness of the keyhole channel for multiple antenna transmission, SM-MIMO schemes are still inferior to SISO/SIMO schemes.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.110613.131590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless network contaminated by Middleton Class A impulsive noise, which is one of the major sources of performance degradation in many wireless systems, including sensor networks. In this scenario, the conventional linear zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer does not perform satisfactorily, since the diversity order does not monotonically increase with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In order to overcome such a problem, we synthesize an improved linear ZF equalizer, which mitigates, in the minimum mean output-energy (MMOE) sense, the impulse noise contribution at the equalizer output. Specifically, the proposed equalizer exploits the fact that the noise samples can be spatially correlated in compact multi-antenna receivers, i.e., when the antenna elements cannot be sufficiently spaced apart due to size constraints. Numerical simulations are performed, aimed at comparing the performances of the proposed ZF-MMOE equalizer with those of competing approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulse noise mitigation for MIMO-OFDM wireless networks with linear equalization","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Measurements & Networking (M&N)","doi":"10.1109/IWMN.2013.6663784","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Measurements & Networking (M&N)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6654603/6663762/06663784.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWMN.2013.6663784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Impulse noise mitigation for MIMO-OFDM wireless networks with linear equalization","conferenceDate":"7-8 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663784/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899977","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulse noise mitigation for MIMO-OFDM wireless networks with linear equalization","confLoc":"Naples, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569798045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06151S","chronDate":"7-8 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6654603","isNumber":"6663762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6654603","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6663762","articleId":"6663784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6663785,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Sara Cacciapuoti","affiliation":["Laboratorio Nazionale di Comunicazioni Multimediali (CNIT), Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Angela Sara","lastName":"Cacciapuoti","id":"37599897900"},{"name":"Marcello Caleffi","affiliation":["Laboratorio Nazionale di Comunicazioni Multimediali (CNIT), Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Marcello","lastName":"Caleffi","id":"37567814300"},{"name":"Francesco Marino","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies (DIETI), University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Marino","id":"37085584508"},{"name":"Luigi Paura","affiliation":["Laboratorio Nazionale di Comunicazioni Multimediali (CNIT), Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Paura","id":"37282080200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2874-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2873-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663785","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Ad hoc networks","Cognitive radio","Markov processes","Sensors","Peer-to-peer computing","Knowledge engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","signal detection","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing functionality","arbitrary node","cognitive radio ad hoc networks","routing update period"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","ad hoc","routing","update period"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing update period in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","doi":"10.1109/IWMN.2013.6663785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663762","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Measurements & Networking (M&N)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Measurements & Networking (M&N)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6654603/6663762/06663785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWMN.2013.6663785","startPage":"100","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663785","abstract":"In this paper, we address the choice of the routing update period in Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks with the objective of maximizing the capacity available at an arbitrary node acting as source.

It measures the actual transmission capacity achievable by the CU in a mobile PU network scenario with a realistic sensing detection capability, namely in the presence of imperfect sensing decisions.

(UWB) Radio-Over-Fiber (ROF) System employing Subcarrier Multiplexing/Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (SCM/DWDM) to extend the coverage and improve high channel efficiency for UWB communication systems. SCM/DWDM is first utilized to the UWB-ROF system, due to the better channel efficiency with narrower channel spacing of the DWDM and the unique commonality of the simple SCM, achieving the large bit rate and high-mobility requirements for the 60 GHz. The novel Optical Frequency Multiplication (OFM) Modulation (Frequency Quadrupler) of 15 GHz lower RF is more cost-effective with much lower RF requirement and dispersion-tolerant even up to a 50 km optical transmission distance in the standard SingleMode Fiber (SMF), compared with Optical Double-Sideband (DSB) Modulation of 30 GHz higher RF. Moreover, we also investigate the novel Punctured Convolutional coding for the system, indicating a trade-off between throughput and Bit Error Ratio (BER). The maximum 1120 Mbits/s throughput per band can be achieved at the expense of 6 dB Eb/No penalty, in contrast to the maximum 480 Mbits/s per band of the current standard Orthogonal-Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-UWB (WiMedia specification v1.2). This study provides a potential solution for the modulation and coding designs of a practical UWB-ROF system.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656030/6663808/06663827.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"60-GHz Ultra-WideBand Radio-Over-Fiber System employing SCM/WDM","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663827","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"60-GHz Ultra-WideBand Radio-Over-Fiber System employing SCM/WDM","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13900008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663827/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"60-GHz Ultra-WideBand Radio-Over-Fiber System employing SCM/WDM","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p85huang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08814S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656030","isNumber":"6663808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656030","xplore-issue":"6663808","articleId":"6663827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6663836,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Fujii","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems Science, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37415810100"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Hatano","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems Science, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Hatano","id":"37429458300"},{"name":"Yu Watanabe","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems Science, Utsunomiya University, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37290939600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0969-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"6663836","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Sensors","Equations","Propagation losses","Conferences","Ultra wideband technology","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","error statistics","sensor fusion","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative detection scheme","cognitive radio system","secondary network","signal transmission","logical fusion method","detection error probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663836","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663836","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new cooperative detection scheme which provides an individual detection for each secondary node unlike the conventional one gives a common decision in the secondary network.

At each secondary node, we give tentative decisions by combining observed signals and provide a final decision by combining the tentative decisions based on a logical fusion method.

Because of their large bandwidth, UWB signals may encounter some problems especially with high sampling rate requirements. Moreover, coherence existence with other narrowband systems is a major concern which needs to be addressed through proper mechanisms. Since narrowband interference (NBI) signals have sparse representation in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain, they can be estimated and suppressed using Compressive Sensing (CS). CS also has the ability to reduce the high sampling rate requirements. For training based NBI mitigation with CS, three pilot groups symbol are used to estimate the NBI signal subspace, UWB signal subspace, and provide information about the channel. In this paper, the distribution of pilot symbols among the three groups is investigated in the presence of strong NBI. The investigation is based on the bit error rate (BER). The influence of each pilot group symbols is also studied. Simulation results show that the third pilot group symbols is the most dominant one; hence more symbols should be assigned to estimate the channel information.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663838","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656030/6663808/06663838.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663808","startPage":"148","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot symbols distribution for compressive sensing based NBI mitigation in UWB systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot symbols distribution for compressive sensing based NBI mitigation in UWB systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663838/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13900029","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663838/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot symbols distribution for compressive sensing based NBI mitigation in UWB systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p148alawsh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054485S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656030","isNumber":"6663808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656030","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6663808","articleId":"6663838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6663840,"authors":[{"name":"Ngoc Phuc Le","affiliation":["School of Electrical, The University of Wollongong Northfields Avenue, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Ngoc Phuc","lastName":"Le","id":"38260750000"},{"name":"Le Chung Tran","affiliation":["School of Electrical, The University of Wollongong Northfields Avenue, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Le Chung","lastName":"Tran","id":"37671757900"},{"name":"Farzad Safaei","affiliation":["School of Electrical, The University of Wollongong Northfields Avenue, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Farzad","lastName":"Safaei","id":"37269428700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0969-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"6663840","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"abstract":"This paper proposes per-subcarrier transmit antenna subset selection with power balancing for MIMO-OFDM UWB systems to simultaneously improve the system error performance and increase data rates. The deployment of the per-subcarrier antenna subset selection may result in a power unbalance across antennas, which could cause power amplifiers (PAs) to operate in their non-linear regions. To overcome this disadvantage, we formulate a linear optimization problem for the optimal allocation of data subcarriers under a constraint that all antennas have the same number of assigned data symbols. This optimization problem could be applied to systems with an arbitrary number of multiplexed data streams, antennas, and with different selection criteria. The efficacy of the proposed allocation scheme from the PA linearity perspective is validated by analyzing the distribution of the peak amplitude of time-domain signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the system without a balancing constraint.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656030/6663808/06663840.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"164","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit antenna subset selection with power balancing for high data rate MIMO-OFDM UWB systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Ultra wideband antennas","Optimization","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","linear programming","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers","transmitting antennas","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power balancing","high data rate MIMO-OFDM UWB systems","per-subcarrier transmit antenna subset selection","system error performance","power amplifiers","nonlinear regions","linear optimization problem","optimal data subcarrier allocation","assigned data symbols","multiplexed data streams","selection criteria","PA linearity","time-domain signals","peak amplitude distribution analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM-UWB","antenna subset selection","power balancing","linear optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Transmit antenna subset selection with power balancing for high data rate MIMO-OFDM UWB systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663840/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13900033","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit antenna subset selection with power balancing for high data rate MIMO-OFDM UWB systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p159le.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085164S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656030","isNumber":"6663808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656030","xplore-issue":"6663808","articleId":"6663840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6663842,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We first propose a novel precoding scheme at the two sources so as to implement the iterative decoder efficiently at the relay. We further address a simplified updating rule of the log-likelihood-ratio (LLR) in such a decoder. Based on the simplified LLR-updating rule and Gaussian approximation, we analyze the theoretical biterror-rate (BER) of the system, which is shown to be consistent with the decoding thresholds and simulated results. Moreover, the theoretical analysis has lower computational complexity than the protograph extrinsic information transfer (PEXIT) algorithm. Consequently, the analysis not only provides a simple way to evaluate the error performance but also facilitates the design of the joint channel-and-PNC (JCNC) in wireless communication scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663856","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656030/6663808/06663856.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of joint channel and physical network coding based on Alamouti STBC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance of joint channel and physical network coding based on Alamouti STBC","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13900027","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663856/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of joint channel and physical network coding based on Alamouti STBC","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p243fang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067371S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656030","isNumber":"6663808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656030","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6663808","articleId":"6663856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6663858,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Khalil Sileh","affiliation":["University of Tikrit, Iraq"],"firstName":"Ibrahim Khalil","lastName":"Sileh","id":"38232978100"},{"name":"Wei Xiang","affiliation":["University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37396484300"},{"name":"Andrew Maxwell","affiliation":["University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Maxwell","id":"37086554018"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0969-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"6663858","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based relay architecture is a promising technique in modern wireless communication systems. In frequency-selective channels, different sub-carriers experience different fades. Data transmitted on the sub-carriers which experience deep fade will have a high probability of getting lost at the destination. In this paper, we propose a multicarrier-adaptive hybrid relay protocol (MC-AHRP) over frequency-selective channels to overcome this problem. In the proposed protocol, the subcarrier performs an amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme when the instantaneous SNR of the source-relay link exceeds a preset threshold value, or it utilizes the adaptive decode-and-forward (ADF) scheme as the alternative. For any subcarrier of the ADF scheme that fails to be decoded, the destination selects the respective subcarrier from the direct transmission path instead. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of bit error probability (BEP). Simulation and numerical results show that a significant performance gain can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656030/6663808/06663858.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"260","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2013.6663858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error probability of OFDM-based hybrid relay protocols over wideband fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Error probability","Fading","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","error statistics","fading channels","OFDM modulation","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error probability","OFDM","wideband fading channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","relay architecture","wireless communication systems","frequency-selective channels","multicarrier-adaptive hybrid relay protocol","MC-AHRP","subcarriers","amplify-and-forward scheme","AF scheme","instantaneous SNR","source-relay link","threshold value","adaptive decode-and-forward scheme","ADF scheme","direct transmission path","bit error probability","BEP","performance gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Hybrid relaying protocols","Bit error probability","Cooperative communications","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Error probability of OFDM-based hybrid relay protocols over wideband fading channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663858/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13900009","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error probability of OFDM-based hybrid relay protocols over wideband fading channels","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"p255sileh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058859S","chronDate":"15-18 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656030","isNumber":"6663808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656030","xplore-issue":"6663808","articleId":"6663858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663859,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Digital signal processing techniques based on the preamble or training signals have widely been proposed to compensate for these mixer imperfections. However, these methods are not suitable for the communication systems without the specified training signals. In this paper, we propose a LS (Least Square) estimation algorithm which can be utilized in any quadrature modulation communication system. The algorithm is based on the baseband signal pre-correction methodology, and the QMC (qudrature modulation correction) parameters can be estimated on line or offline depending on the working mode. The proposed algorithm has been thoroughly tested in the RF transceiver system. The test result shows that the ACLR performance outperforms the WCDMA standard with about 6dB margin with single carrier and at least 5dB margin with four carriers and can eliminate the QM distortion effectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A LS estimation algorithm on quadrature modulation correction scheme for LTE/WCDMA RF transceiver","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663893","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06663893.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A LS estimation algorithm on quadrature modulation correction scheme for LTE/WCDMA RF transceiver","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663893/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914627","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A LS estimation algorithm on quadrature modulation correction scheme for LTE/WCDMA RF transceiver","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037573S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6663893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663894,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoya Zuo","affiliation":["Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoya","lastName":"Zuo","id":"38247236800"},{"name":"Ding Wang","affiliation":["Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Wang","id":"37558607400"},{"name":"Rugui Yao","affiliation":["Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Rugui","lastName":"Yao","id":"37068721100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663894","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663894","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Frequency-domain analysis","Equalizers","Bit error rate","Complexity theory","Interference","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","equalisers","personal area networks","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRC-FDE UWB system","direct sequence spreading","ultrawideband technology","wireless personal area network","WPAN","single carrier block transmission","frequency domain equalization","frequency selective channel","multipath diversity","cyclic prefix block transmission UWB system","maximal ratio combining"]}],"abstract":"Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology has become an ideal candidate for wireless personal area network (WPAN). UWB channel is characterized by rich multipath components. Single carrier block transmission with frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) is an effective way to combat frequency selective channels. In order to collect full multipath diversity when operating FDE, direct sequence spreading is introduced to cyclic prefix (CP) block transmission UWB system. With maximal ratio combining (MRC) FDE, theoretical analysis show that full diversity could be strictly achieved. It is also demonstrated that the system shows a robust performance with short CP or even without CP. Finally, it is shown that the receiver complexity of the system is even lower than conventional linear frequency domain equalizers.

The main goal of this paper is to obtain an efficient time domain threshold and achieve the channel estimation performance approaching the least squares (LS) method with exact sparsity (exact number of non-zero channel taps) without using prior knowledge of both channel statistics and noise standard deviation. Firstly, classical LS method is used to get an initial channel impulse response (CIR) estimate. Then a novel effective threshold, estimated from the noise coefficients of the initial estimated CIR, is proposed. Finally, the obtained threshold is used to select the most significant taps. Simulations show that the proposed method is able to achieve good channel estimation performances for sparse channel within a comparatively wide range of sparsity with small number of pilots and moderate computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663907","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06663907.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold based most significant taps detection for sparse channel estimation in OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Threshold based most significant taps detection for sparse channel estimation in OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663907/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899022","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663907/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold based most significant taps detection for sparse channel estimation in OFDM system","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084229S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6663907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6663917,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Bi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Bi","id":"37076505300"},{"name":"Xiang-dong Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-dong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086661166"},{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Drilling and Production Technology Research Institute CNPC Chuanqing Drilling Engineering Company Limited, Guanghan, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086660316"},{"name":"Jian Yang","affiliation":["Sichuan Engineering Technical College, Deyang, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086659818"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663917","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":558},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Complexity theory","PSNR","Vectors","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","compressed sensing","data compression","image coding","image reconstruction","image sensors","iterative methods","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable step size stagewise adaptive matching pursuit algorithm","image compressed sensing","signal reconstruction","SAMP algorithm","sparsity adaptive matching pursuit algorithm","VSStAMP algorithm","sparsity level estimation","adaptive estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","reconstruction","adaptive","matching pursuit"]}],"abstract":"Compressed sensing is a widely used framework for signal reconstruction.

Compared with the conventional correlator-based approach, the mean acquisition time of the proposed approach is much shorter. However, we find that the spatial filter and temporal filter weights are not unique in the proposed scheme; theoretical analysis and computer simulation show there are undesired trivial solutions which are related with the PN code sequence's time domain and frequency domain structure. Inspired by this literature, we propose a novel two-dimensional space-time processing scheme in this paper. The proposed scheme performs beamforming and code acquisition simultaneously like the approach in [1], but can avoid the undesired trivial solutions. For the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel scenario, we obtain the closed-form expression for optimum filter weights and propose an adaptive implementation algorithm for the proposed structure.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663931","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06663931.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663931","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel two-dimensional space-time processing scheme for DS/CDMA code acquisition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663931/","displayDocTitle":"A novel two-dimensional space-time processing scheme for DS/CDMA code acquisition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899226","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663931/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel two-dimensional space-time processing scheme for DS/CDMA code acquisition","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054509S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6663931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663936,"authors":[{"name":"Bi Yang","affiliation":["College of Marine, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Bi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086652156"},{"name":"Wang Yingmin","affiliation":["College of Marine, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yingmin","id":"37545990700"},{"name":"Xiao Haifeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an aero university, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Haifeng","id":"37086654911"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663936","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Focusing","Broadband communication","Arrays","Frequency estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Narrowband","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","focusing","frequency estimation","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband signal beamforming","rotational signal subspace method","optimal focusing frequency estimation","focusing matrix","delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rotational signal subspace method","optimal focusing frequency","broadband beam-forming"]}],"abstract":"A broadband signal beam-forming using rotational signal subspace method based on the estimation of the optimal focusing frequency is proposed in this paper.

All existed PAPR reduction methods in the literature such as clipping, phase shift and compand transform are based on the conventional OFDM scheme, which means that the modulation system usually has a fixed symbol block length or fixed subcarrier number. In this paper we introduce a new concept, namely time-varying symbol block length or time-varying subcarrier number, into the OFDM system to reduce the PAPR values. We call the new modulation system Time-varying OFDM (TV-OFDM). Here, the PAPR is used as a criterion to adjust the symbol block length or subcarrier number accordingly. The algorithm for finding out the symbol block length or subcarrier number is present, and the comparison results with other classical PAPR reduction methods in the literature are given by numerous experiment. The simulation results show that the time-varying modulation schemes can clearly reduce the PAPR values of the OFDM system, while the Symbol Error Rate (SER) of time-invariant OFDM and TV-OFDM modulation remains almost constant.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC

theoretical study of the Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, but it is difficult to implement it in practical application. Therefore, there is a great need to design effective quantitative method which enables us to implement it in hardware easily. In this paper, the min-sum decoding algorithm of LDPC codes for 8PSK modulation is studied in detail, and the method of the uniform quantization is analyzed and deduced. With this method to quantify the initial message, the variable messages and check messages are converted into integers after each iteration. Then the min-sum decoding algorithm based on integer arithmetic for 8PSK modulation is implemented. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the min-sum decoding algorithm with the uniform quantization is close to that of the high-precision floating-point sum-product decoding algorithm. Meanwhile, all the variables in the algorithm are fixed-length integers, so it is convenient for hardware implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914624","htmlLink":"/document/6663960/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Uniform quantization of LDPC codes for 8PSK modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniform quantization of LDPC codes for 8PSK modulation","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105425S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6663960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663974,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Guo","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, P.

According to the characteristics of uplink transmission, we find it is a good choice to solve the multiple DFOs problem in the spatial-domain. The proposed scheme consists of a mobile relay station (MRS) between the base station (BS) and the mobile terminal (MT). The MRS is immobile respect to the MT, and hence the DFOs are only generated between the MRS and the BS. The MRS uses an antenna array to transmit signals through different paths. The DFOs are estimated during the downlink, and the DFO for each path is separately compensated before the particular transmit beamforming for this path. Therefore, all the signals in different paths are superimposed at the BS without DFO, and the BS does not have to be changed in this case of high-mobility scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Doppler frequency offsets compensation technique for high-mobility OFDM uplink","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663974","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06663974.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Doppler frequency offsets compensation technique for high-mobility OFDM uplink","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663974/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899037","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Doppler frequency offsets compensation technique for high-mobility OFDM uplink","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055408S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6663974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6663975,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Simulation results show that the proposed limited feedback scheme yields higher sum-rate than the conventional solutions such as non-cooperative eigen-beamforming in the high SINR regime.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switched-mode limited feedback for cooperative multiceli MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663975","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06663975.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Switched-mode limited feedback for cooperative multiceli MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6663975/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899053","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched-mode limited feedback for cooperative multiceli MIMO systems","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078082S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6663975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6663979,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Wang","id":"38546916200"},{"name":"Huawei Chen","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Huawei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293456400"},{"name":"Yu Bao","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Bao","id":"38546774900"},{"name":"Linjian Li","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Linjian","lastName":"Li","id":"38547877700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663979","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Passband","Wideband","Array signal processing","Microphone arrays","Finite impulse response filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","computational complexity","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steerable-frequency invariant beamformers","microphone mismatches","wideband beamformers","steerable passband","SFI wideband beamformers","Farrow structure","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Farrow stucture","steerable wideband beamformer","robustness","frequency-invariant passband"]}],"abstract":"Due to the presence of possibly moving sources in practical applications, it is of interest to design wideband beamformers with a steerable passband for microphone arrays.

And the special application also provides a possibility for applying the bran-new theory, known as compressive sensing (CS), to TWI. However, due to the high sensitivity of CS in model error, the approximate propagation model which is widely used by conventional imaging algorithms will hardly satisfy the requirement of CS for robust reconstruction any longer, especially in the noisy environments. Except for target positioning error, the model error also results in the deterioration of image quality, such as integral sidelobe ratio. In this paper, the approach for calculating the accurate propagation model is presented. And with numerical simulations, the effects of model error on both conventional algorithms and CS are demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663981","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06663981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of accurate signal propagation model for through-wall imaging radar using compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of accurate signal propagation model for through-wall imaging radar using compressive sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663981/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899038","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663981/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of accurate signal propagation model for through-wall imaging radar using compressive sensing","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044454S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6663981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663982,"authors":[{"name":"Min Su","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Su","id":"37085872061"},{"name":"Bo Yi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Yi","id":"37085840621"},{"name":"Pei-Guo Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Pei-Guo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402098000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663982","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","Standards","Coplanar waveguides","Equations","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion (wave)","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical dispersion analysis","three-dimensional LOD-FDTD method","improved 3D locally one-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method","time step","dispersion control parameter","normalized numerical phase velocity errors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["locally one-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (LOD-FDTD)","dispersion controls parameters","stability","numerical dispersion","Courant Friedrich Lewy (CFL) limit"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an improved three-dimensional (3D) locally one-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (LOD-FDTD) method is presented.

In recent years, we have seen that the performance of CS systems can be improved by using a carefully designed projection matrix rather than a random one. In particular, we can reduce the coherence between the columns of the equivalent dictionary thanks to a well-designed projection matrix. Then, we can get a lower reconstruction error and a higher successful reconstruction rate. In some applications, the signals of interest have nonzero entries occurring in clusters - i.e., block-sparse signals. In this paper, we use the equiangular tight frame (ETF) to approach the Gram matrix of equivalent dictionary rather than the identity matrix used in [1]. Then, we minimize a weighted sum of the subblock coherence and the interblock coherence of the equivalent dictionary. The simulation results show that our novel method for projection matrix optimization significantly improves the ability of block-sparse approximation techniques to reconstruct and classify signals than the method proposed by Lihi Zelnik-Manor (LZM) [1].","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663993","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06663993.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6663993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projection matrix optimization for block-sparse compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Projection matrix optimization for block-sparse compressive sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6663993/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899201","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6663993/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projection matrix optimization for block-sparse compressive sensing","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057462S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6663993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6663996,"authors":[{"name":"Baolei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Baolei","lastName":"Li","id":"38239962400"},{"name":"Xinling Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Xinling","lastName":"Shi","id":"37401243900"},{"name":"Jianhua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37578893400"},{"name":"Changxing Gou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Changxing","lastName":"Gou","id":"37086645069"},{"name":"Tiansong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Information School, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Tiansong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086645177"},{"name":"Zhenzhou An","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Zhenzhou","lastName":"An","id":"37586677600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6663996","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servomotors","Finite impulse response filters","Particle swarm optimization","Adaptive systems","Adaptive filters","System identification","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive identification","recursive particle swarm optimization","RPSO algorithm","time-invariant servo system","gradual servo system","online servo system identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recursive PSO","recursive identification","servo system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6663996","abstract":"In order to improve the tracking result in recursive identification of servo system, a novel recursive particle swarm optimization (RPSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper.

The detailed modulation and demodulation methods are presented and the application potentials of the new waveform in MIMO-SAR are investigated. The proposed waveform diversity design method has the advantages of implementation simplicity and easy integration with the conventional SAR processor. Semi-physical simulation with an Agilent arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and a high-speed oscilloscope (OSC) verifies the scheme. The performance is also evaluated by theoretical analysis and simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulating multicarriers with chirp for MIMO-SAR waveform diversity design","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664000","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06664000.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Modulating multicarriers with chirp for MIMO-SAR waveform diversity design","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664000/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899142","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulating multicarriers with chirp for MIMO-SAR waveform diversity design","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041381S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6664000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6664002,"authors":[{"name":"Tiansong Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Tiansong","lastName":"Li","id":"37086645177"},{"name":"Xinling Shi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Xinling","lastName":"Shi","id":"37401243900"},{"name":"Jianhua Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37578893400"},{"name":"Yajie Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Yajie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086653471"},{"name":"Baolei Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Baolei","lastName":"Li","id":"38239962400"},{"name":"Changxing Gou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Changxing","lastName":"Gou","id":"37086645069"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6664002","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664002","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface reconstruction","Splines (mathematics)","Particle swarm optimization","Vectors","Neural networks","Interpolation","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","particle swarm optimisation","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["root square error","optimal parameters","3D data points","control points","surface optimization problem","B-spline surface interpolation algorithm","particle swarm optimization","global double cubic B-spline surface interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["B-spline surface","knot vector","control points","B-spline surface interpolation","parameterization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664002","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06664002.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The global double cubic B-spline surface interpolation based on particle swarm optimization","abstract":"a novel B-spline surface interpolation algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is proposed to solve surface optimization problem.

The system can be used for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of targets for array radar via the MUSIC algorithm by the completing data.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664017","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06664017.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOA estimation of array radar via random interval sub-Nyquist-sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"DOA estimation of array radar via random interval sub-Nyquist-sampling","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664017/","accessionNumber":"13899081","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664017/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA estimation of array radar via random interval sub-Nyquist-sampling","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04598S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6664017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6664020,"authors":[{"name":"Lina Fan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Fan","id":"37401748700"},{"name":"Jinkuan Wang","affiliation":["Engineering Optimization and Smart Antenna Institute, Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Jinkuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280537400"},{"name":"Jing Gao","affiliation":["Engineering Optimization and Smart Antenna Institute, Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Gao","id":"37405516000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6664020","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Cognitive radio","Interference","OFDM","Complexity theory","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cognitive radio","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio system","OFDM-based relay","power allocation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","channel capacity","secondary users","primary user"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power allocation","cognitive radio","relay"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop an optimal power allocation algorithm for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(OFDM)-based relay cognitive radio systems.

The idea is to convert BSS problem into general CS form and incorporate an iterative dictionary self-learning strategy with sparse reconstruction to solve it. The proposed method contains two stages. Firstly, a feature clustering method is used to estimate the mixing matrix. Secondly, an alternating iteration procedure is introduced to refine the estimation of the sparse dictionary and the source signals. In each iteration step, the sparse dictionary is obtained using a self-learning algorithm with the last estimates of the sources signals, and then the sources signals are reestimated using the CS based blind separation method with the new sparse dictionary. By adaptively regenerating the dictionaries, the refined dictionaries are approaching the optimal sparse basis of the original sources, which results in the separation performance improvement simultaneously. This dictionary self-learning method doesn't need any prior information about the original speeches, i.e., it is an unsupervised method.

for wireless sensor networks","abstract":"In this paper, a random amplitude weighting approach is proposed to guarantee the security at physical layers for distributed wireless sensor networks. Each sensor estimates the channels by training symbols sending from the expected receiver. Then the collaborative sensors cooperate in transmission signals to the receiver with weightings. Weighting coefficients with random amplitudes and fixed phases compensating the phase offsets are picked by each sensor in each transmission. With this approach, equivalent channels between the sensors and the expected receiver are almost invariant and the phase alignment is achieved. Simultaneously channels between the sensors and the eavesdropper are changing fiercely and the phase of the received signal at the eavesdropper is confusing. Hence the eavesdropper can hardly demodulate the received signals correctly and timely. Compared to the two proposed methods, our method is more suitable for wireless distributed structure in acquisition of weighting coefficients. Simulation results shows that our method can provide a better SNR performance with corresponding lower bit error rate (BER) at expected receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6664069/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899021","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A random-amplitude-weighting security approaches at physical layer for wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A random-amplitude-weighting security approaches at physical layer for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050012S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6664069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6664075,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, P.

Traditional channel estimation methods are usually based on the classical (Least Squares) LS method without considering whether the multipath channel is sparse or rich, therefore, those methods can hardly balance the channel estimation performance, spectrum efficiency and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose an effective compressed sensing (CS) based sparse channel estimation method for OFDM system. As an efficient reconstruction tool for CS, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is adopted in this paper for sparse channel estimation. For OMP algorithm, an good threshold is essential to promote the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed threshold is formulated based on theoretical derivation and analysis. Both simulation results and computational complexity evaluation show that the proposed method can effectively balance the channel estimation performance, spectrum efficiency and computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664075","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06664075.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel effective compressed sensing based sparse channel estimation in OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel effective compressed sensing based sparse channel estimation in OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664075/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899074","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6664075/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel effective compressed sensing based sparse channel estimation in OFDM system","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06691S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6664075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6664084,"authors":[{"name":"Donglai Hao","affiliation":["Department of Information transmission, Xi'an Communication Institute, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Donglai","lastName":"Hao","id":"37086646673"},{"name":"Xiangyang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Information transmission, Xi'an Communication Institute, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086647109"},{"name":"Donghong Xie","affiliation":["Department of Information transmission, Xi'an Communication Institute, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Donghong","lastName":"Xie","id":"37086650403"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6664084","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Matrix decomposition","Clustering algorithms","Interference","Collaboration","Signal processing algorithms","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","iterative methods","MIMO systems","precoding","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block diagonal precoding algorithm","collaborative MIMO system","coordinated multipoint MIMO systems","sum rate maximization","convex optimization theory","precoding vector","iterative algorithm","transmit antennas","receive antennas","cell coordinated clusters","system capacity","utility function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-Input Multiple-Output(MIMO)","precoding coordinated multi-point","convex optimization"]}],"abstract":"On the research of coordinated multi-point MIMO systems, a new precoding scheme is proposed for maximizing the weighted sum rates.

The whole PGA consumes less than 1.26 mW with a 1 V supply.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664105","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06664105.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2 MHz 1 V programmable gain amplifier for WSN application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A 2 MHz 1 V programmable gain amplifier for WSN application","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664105/","accessionNumber":"13899028","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664105/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2 MHz 1 V programmable gain amplifier for WSN application","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086237S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6664105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6664107,"authors":[{"name":"Chongbin Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Chongbin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38581312600"},{"name":"Falin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Falin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085500975"},{"name":"Zhizhen Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Zhizhen","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38581228100"},{"name":"Binbing Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Binbing","lastName":"Li","id":"38581250200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6664107","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Azimuth","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Synthetic aperture radar","Memory management","Imaging","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","echo","image resolution","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAR imaging","2-D block compressive sensing","synthetic aperture radar systems","SAR systems","two dimension image resolution","compressive sensing theory","range compression","azimuth compression","echo signals","range cell migration","computation complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing","SAR imaging"]}],"abstract":"For synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, high data rate is generally needed to achieve high-resolution of two dimension images, which leads to the huge amount of data storage. In the framework of compressive sensing theory, the compressibility of the signal makes it possible to reconstruct the signal from significantly reduced number of samples. And the radar data is proven to be compressible in most cases. In this study, a new SAR imaging scheme based on compressive sensing is proposed. This strategy performs range compression and azimuth compression simultaneously, and takes advantage of the correlation of the echo signals received in different azimuth positions. Moreover, this strategy does not need to perform Range Cell Migration. The computation complexity as well as the memory required is significantly reduced. Simulation experiments are carried out with additive noise, which imply the feasibility and advantages of the new strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664107","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06664107.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A strategy of SAR imaging based on 2-D block compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664107/","displayDocTitle":"A strategy of SAR imaging based on 2-D block compressive sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898988","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664107/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A strategy of SAR imaging based on 2-D block compressive sensing","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069749S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6664107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6664117,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Wei","affiliation":["China Ship Development And Design Center, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Wei","id":"38273463100"},{"name":"Xiao Longzhong","affiliation":["China Ship Development And Design Center, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Longzhong","id":"37086740691"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6664117","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664117","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic beams","Interference","Acoustics","Arrays","Acoustic measurements","Sea measurements","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic imaging","array signal processing","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["focused beam forming algorithm","null constrained weight","coherent interference position"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["focused beam forming","underwater image","null constrained weight","coherent interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664117","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06664117.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A focused beam forming algorithm with null constrained weight","abstract":"A null weight constrained by zero and first derivative based on focused beam forming is proposed in this paper.

To avoid this, a high-resolution 2-D imaging approach based on a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sonar is proposed in this paper. The MIMO sonar is composed of four uniform linear arrays (ULAs) located on four sides of a rectangle. And narrowband waveforms coded with orthogonal polyphase sequences are employed as transmitting waveforms. By matched filtering the outputs at each receiving sensor, the MIMO sonar is equivalent to a virtual rectangular array with a twice big aperture. With theoretical analysis and computer simulations, we show that the MIMO sonar can save a great number of sensors and double the cross-range resolution simultaneously, when compared to a conventional rectangular array with the same physical size.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664124","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06664124.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution 2-D imaging using narrowband MIMO sonar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664124/","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution 2-D imaging using narrowband MIMO sonar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899089","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664124/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution 2-D imaging using narrowband MIMO sonar","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045126S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6664124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6664125,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Xiong-hou","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustic Engineering Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xiong-hou","id":"37086704902"},{"name":"Sun Chao","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustic Engineering Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Chao","id":"37548308200"},{"name":"Zhuo Jie","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustic Engineering Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Jie","id":"37086707253"},{"name":"Liu Zong-wei","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustic Engineering Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Zong-wei","id":"38290348200"},{"name":"Xiang Long-feng","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustic Engineering Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Long-feng","id":"37086708185"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6664125","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sonar","Imaging","Sensors","Arrays","MIMO","Bandwidth","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filters","MIMO radar","OFDM modulation","sensor arrays","sensors","sonar imaging","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB pulse transmission","pulse illumination","UWB pulse processing","UWB signals","echo components","matched filtering","OFDM- LFM pulses","receiving rectangular array","multi transmitting sensors","UWB-MIMO sonar","UWB multiple-input multiple-output sonar","2-D imaging approach","limited system bandwidth","UWB waveforms","sonar imaging system","cross-range resolution","large-bandwidth waveforms","UWB imaging system","ultrawideband imaging system","ultrawideband MIMO sonar","high-resolution 2-D imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sonar imaging","2-D imaging","ultra-wideband (UWB)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) sonar","high resolution"]}],"abstract":"An ultra-wideband (UWB) imaging system can provide better cross-range resolution by using large-bandwidth waveforms.

Moreover, the experimental results show that this improved method outperforms the other three methods, particularly in the case of low SNR.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Fractals","Bayes methods","Wireless communication","Radio transmitters","IEEE 802.11 Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase detectors","radio transmitters","statistical analysis","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wi-Fi transmitter transient detection","statistical method","variance fractal dimension threshold detection","Bayesian step change detection","phase detection","mean change point detection","nonparametric estimation","hypothesis test","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wi-Fi Transmitter","Leading Response","Transient Detection","Mean Change Point Detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664128","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication and Computing (ICSPCC 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648511/6663867/06664128.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC.2013.6664128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Wi-Fi transmitter transients using statistical method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Wi-Fi transmitter transients using statistical method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664128/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664128/","accessionNumber":"13899041","conferenceDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Wi-Fi transmitter transients using statistical method","confLoc":"KunMing, China","sourcePdf":"1743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044107S","chronDate":"5-8 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648511","isNumber":"6663867","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648511","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6663867","articleId":"6664128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6664133,"authors":[{"name":"Qiao Liang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology On Blind Signal Processing Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qiao","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086668552"},{"name":"Zheng Hui","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology On Blind Signal Processing Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Hui","id":"37086669649"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1027-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6664133","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new adaptive time delay estimation algorithm based on MMSE criterion","abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of time delay estimation between signals received at two spatially separated sensors at low signal-to-noise ration levels.

An accurate traffic prediction model should have the ability to capture the prominent traffic characteristics, e.g. short and long dependence, self similarity in large-time scale and multifractal in small-time scale. For these reasons time series models are introduced in network traffic simulation and prediction. Accurate traffic prediction may be used to optimally smooth delay sensitive traffic or dynamically allocate bandwidth to traffic streams. A modified Elman neural network model is proposed for the network system in this paper. Compared to the traditional Elman neural network model, the proposed model is nonlinear, multivariable and time-varying and has higher accuracy and better adaptability. By the model, a abnormal behavior of network traffic can be found on time through the test of adaptive boundary value. The experimental results show the model is effective and feasible for Network traffic prediction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6637132/6664224/06664250.pdf","startPage":"629","endPage":"633","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664224","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Elman neural network and its application to network traffic prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Predictive models","Neural networks","Adaptation models","Standards","Internet","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network management","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["abnormal network traffic behavior","adaptive boundary value","network traffic simulation","time series models","traffic characteristics","network management","wireless management","admission control","congestion control","adaptive applications","network traffic prediction","modified Elman neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elman neural network (ENN)","Modified ENN","Network traffic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Modified Elman neural network and its application to network traffic prediction","isConference":true,"volume":"02","htmlLink":"/document/6664250/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13898364","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Elman neural network and its application to network traffic prediction","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"168429d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047668S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6637132","isNumber":"6664224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6637132","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6664224","articleId":"6664250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6664298,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"38548579900"},{"name":"Yuan'an Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering"],"firstName":"Yuan'an","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086716179"},{"name":"Gang Xie","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37305624300"},{"name":"Panliang Deng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering"],"firstName":"Panliang","lastName":"Deng","id":"37604436400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6664298","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optimization","Throughput","Femtocell networks","Interference","Joints","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","optimisation","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uniform threshold algorithm","network throughput","power allocation problem","spectrum detection problem","joint optimization","MU","macrocell user","false alarm","miss detection","device preference","channel fading","FAP reliability","femtocell access point","femtocell networks","dynamic spectrum sharing","decentralized resource allocation","relaxation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource allocation","Relaxation algorithm","Femtocell network","Cognitive radio"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic spectrum sharing can improve the spectrum efficiency under some constraints on the interference to the authorized users.

The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the throughput of femtocell networks than uniform threshold algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664298","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6637132/6664224/06664298.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A relaxation algorithm for decentralized resource allocation in femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664298/","displayDocTitle":"A relaxation algorithm for decentralized resource allocation in femtocell networks","volume":"02","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13898360","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664298/","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A relaxation algorithm for decentralized resource allocation in femtocell networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"241512d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057179S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6637132","isNumber":"6664224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6637132","xplore-issue":"6664224","articleId":"6664298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6664304,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxiao Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086775289"},{"name":"Weidong Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086637921"},{"name":"Yinghai Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yinghai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086723331"},{"name":"Gaofeng Cui","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gaofeng","lastName":"Cui","id":"38236122700"},{"name":"Sixing Lu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sixing","lastName":"Lu","id":"38520777300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6664304","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Throughput","Macrocell networks","Radio spectrum management","Ultrafast electronics","Resource management","Femtocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","femtocellular radio","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","indoor radio","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive frequency allocation scheme","OFDMA femtocell networks","high-data rate requirement","indoor communication","indoor radio coverage","system capacity","cochannel interference","system throughput","AFA scheme","LTE network","interference mitigation","cochannel frequency allocation","cochannel FA","orthogonal frequency allocation","OFA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","Femtocell","Frequency allocation"]}],"abstract":"Due to high data rate requirement for indoor communication, femtocells have been proposed as a potential solution to increase not only indoor radio coverage but also system capacity.

In this paper, we study the power and channel allocation under the hybrid spectrum access in multiple secondary user (SU) environment. Considering not only the interference caused to primary user (PU) and the average transmit power constraints, but also the different traffic demand of SUs and the interference among SUs existed in multiple SU environments, a distributed channel and power allocation algorithm are proposed to maximize the system throughput while satisfying the QoS of SU transmissions. With these inequality constraints, Lagrange dual composition method is introduced for this nonlinear optimization problem.

We present invis, the first visual analysis tool to facilitate exploration of in vitro selection sequence spaces. invis introduces a novel configuration of coordinated views that enables simultaneous inspection of global projections of sequence data alongside local regions of selected dimensions and sequence clusters. It allows scientists to isolate related sequences for further data analysis, compare sequence populations over varying conditions, filter sequences based on their similarities, and visualize likely pathways of genetic evolution. User feedback indicates that invis enables effective exploration of in vitro RNA selection sequences.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization (BioVis)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648474/6664331/06664340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization (BioVis)","doi":"10.1109/BioVis.2013.6664340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioVis.2013.6664340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"invis: Exploring high-dimensional RNA sequences from in vitro selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","RNA","Genomics","Bioinformatics","In vitro","DNA","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","catalysis","evolution (biological)","genetics","molecular biophysics","molecular configurations","RNA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-dimensional RNA sequences","RNA molecules","catalysis properties","binding properties","genetic variation","molecular evolution","high-dimensional space","biologists lack adequate tools","visual analysis","invis","sequence clusters","data analysis","genetic evolution","in vitro RNA selection sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["J.3 [Computer Applications]: Life and Medical Sciences \u2014 Biology and Genetics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"invis: Exploring high-dimensional RNA sequences from in vitro selection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664340/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898655","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"13-14 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"invis: Exploring high-dimensional RNA sequences from in vitro selection","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"001demiralp.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083996S","chronDate":"13-14 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648474","isNumber":"6664331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648474","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6664331","articleId":"6664340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6664345,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo de Heras Ciechomski","affiliation":["ScienceVisuals Sarl Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"de Heras Ciechomski","id":"38186343000"},{"name":"Michael Klann","affiliation":["ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Klann","id":"37634118300"},{"name":"Robin Mange","affiliation":["ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Mange","id":"38186336000"},{"name":"Heinz Koeppl","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, IBM Research, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Heinz","lastName":"Koeppl","id":"37285057700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1658-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6664345","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":623},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Visualization","Solid modeling","Microscopy","Mathematical model","Data visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biological techniques","biology computing","Brownian motion","C++ language","chemical reactions","computer software","drugs","fluorescence","optical microscopy","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemical reaction networks","3D dynamics","ZigCell3D modeling","visualisation framework","systems-oriented research","biological processes","drug candidates","biological complexity","interactive virtual 3D cell","ZigCell3D software","model parameters","molecular levels","fluorescence microscopy image","virtual 3D whiteboard approach","chemical reaction modelling","realtime interactive environment","game-like 3D environment","multicore parallel C-C++ ray tracing engine","3D isosurface model","PDB files","coarse-grained Brownian motion","virtual fluorescence microscopy","virtual simulation environment","benchmarking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664345","doi":"10.1109/BioVis.2013.6664345","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization (BioVis)","abstract":"Systems-oriented research accelerates our understanding of biological processes and helps in identifying novel drug candidates. However, development of good models and our intuition is hampered by the biological complexity. To be able to see how candidate models evolve in front of the user in an interactive virtual 3D cell at various zoom levels, therefore is a crucial aspect and a challenging problem. The motivation for creating the ZigCell3D software, is thus a holistic view ranging from being able to change model parameters, see how they affect 3D versions of the cell at molecular levels, while at the same time being able to verify the simulated model against a real experimental fluorescence microscopy image. ZigCell3D is a virtual 3D whiteboard approach to chemical reaction modelling. It aims to provide a realtime interactive environment, where complex biophysics research is turned into a creative and game-like 3D environment. The complete system entails modelling, simulation and visualisation as part of a unified framework. The core visualisation is based on a multi-core parallel C/C++ ray tracing engine, that builds a complete 3D iso-surface model of the cell, its organelles and molecules down to the atomic level using PDB files. The simulator itself is based on coarse-grained Brownian motion of the individual molecules, which is visualised in detail in a tightly coupled manner. Using a virtual fluorescence microscope the virtual simulation environment can be benchmarked against real life experimental data.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioVis.2013.6664345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664331","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization (BioVis)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648474/6664331/06664345.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From biochemical reaction networks to 3D dynamics in the cell: The ZigCell3D modeling, simulation and visualisation framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6664345/","displayDocTitle":"From biochemical reaction networks to 3D dynamics in the cell: The ZigCell3D modeling, simulation and visualisation framework","conferenceDate":"13-14 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13898661","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From biochemical reaction networks to 3D dynamics in the cell: The ZigCell3D modeling, simulation and visualisation framework","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"041deheras.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125276S","chronDate":"13-14 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648474","isNumber":"6664331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648474","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6664331","articleId":"6664345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6664371,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Li","id":"37086644846"},{"name":"Weiqing Sun","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Technology, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Weiqing","lastName":"Sun","id":"37716026600"},{"name":"Lingfeng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science"],"firstName":"Lingfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280770900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6664371","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":721},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664371","abstract":"Intrusion detection system (IDS) is an important component to maintain network security. Also, as the cloud platform is quickly evolving and becoming more popular in our everyday life, it is useful and necessary to build an effective IDS for the cloud. However, existing intrusion detection techniques will be likely to face challenges when deployed on the cloud platform. The pre-determined IDS architecture may lead to overloading of a part of the cloud due to the extra detection overhead. This paper proposes a neural network based IDS which is a distributed system with an adaptive architecture so as to make full use of the available resources without overloading any single machine in the cloud. Moreover, with the machine learning ability from the neural network, the proposed IDS can detect new types of attacks with fairly accurate results. Evaluation of the proposed IDS with the KDD dataset on a physical cloud testbed shows that it is a promising approach to detecting attacks in the cloud infrastructure.","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664371","startPage":"75","endPage":"79","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence

Numerical experimental results show that PPSO with genetic migration (PPSO_GM) can greatly improve the convergence property of particle swarm optimization (PSO), compared with PPSO with traditional unidirectional ring migration (PPSO_URM); and two orders of magnitude more speedups are achieved by PPSO_GM against serial PSO (SPSO) for all ten 100-dimensional benchmark test functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13898266","htmlLink":"/document/6664376/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"01","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parallel particle swarm optimization with genetic communication strategy and its implementation on GPU","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel particle swarm optimization with genetic communication strategy and its implementation on GPU","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"028264d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098339S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6637132","isNumber":"6664354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6637132","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6664354","articleId":"6664376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6664414,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Du","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Du","id":"37061150000"},{"name":"Xiaolong Fu","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Fu","id":"37827743900"},{"name":"Can Zhao","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Can","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086651458"},{"name":"Ting Liu","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085508846"},{"name":"Qifeng Liu","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qifeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37061434400"},{"name":"Qixin Liu","affiliation":["Information Technology Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qixin","lastName":"Liu","id":"38105450500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6664414","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":564},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664414","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Social network services","Educational institutions","Collaboration","Internet","Data mining","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi domain cloud social network service platform","online collaborations","public social network services","Facebook","Twitter","YouTube","specialized social network services","enterprise social network services","campus social network services","cloud service","user defined groups","multi level predefined groups","user behavior patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Social network service","Multi-Domain","Online collaborations","Cloud service","Multi-level groups"]}],"abstract":"With the dazzling success that public social network services like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube etc. have achieved during the past few years, a variety of specialized social network services, enterprise social network services, and campus social network services for colleges and universities have emerged and developed in recent years. Campus social network services orient at users on the same campus and focus on providing information sharing, knowledge sharing and especially online collaboration services. We propose the design of a multi-domain social network service platform supporting information communication, knowledge sharing and especially online collaborations in different aspects of colleges and universities including teaching, learning and research in the form of cloud service. The platform provides multi-level predefined and user defined groups in independent social domains. By this way, we can not only achieve a more natural convergence between user behavior patterns in the real world environment and that in the online environment provided by campus social network services; but also realize the sharing of management and service responsibilities of campus social network service between management sectors and IT sectors in colleges and universities.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664414","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6637132/6664354/06664414.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"291","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-domain cloud social network service platform supporting online collaborations on campus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Multi-domain cloud social network service platform supporting online collaborations on campus","isConference":true,"volume":"01","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6664414/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13898217","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664414/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-domain cloud social network service platform supporting online collaborations on campus","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"076118d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041353S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6637132","isNumber":"6664354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6637132","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6664354","articleId":"6664414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6664429,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongzhi Shi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongzhi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085616242"},{"name":"Guang Jiang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086731316"},{"name":"Bo Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598211300"},{"name":"Jinpeng Yue","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinpeng","lastName":"Yue","id":"37085554616"},{"name":"Xiaofei Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086734482"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6664429","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Computational modeling","Quality of service","Correlation","Cloud computing","Knowledge discovery","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data mining","information retrieval systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["research directions","consciousness and memory model","CMIRS","cross-media intelligent retrieval system","CAM","cognitive modeling","generative modeling","discriminative modeling","cross-media semantic understanding","knowledge discovery","cloud computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-media","Knowledge discovery","Cloud computing","CMIRS"]}],"abstract":"Cross-media is the outstanding characteristics of the age of big data with large scale and complicated processing task.

By means of the framework, the cloud service suppliers can better understand the user's requirements, and the trust between the users and the suppliers is more easily acquired.","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664451","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6637132/6664354/06664451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664354","startPage":"476","endPage":"480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A risk management framework for cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A risk management framework for cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664451/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"volume":"01","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13898245","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6664451/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A risk management framework for cloud computing","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"125483d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094459S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6637132","isNumber":"6664354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6637132","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6664354","articleId":"6664451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6664472,"authors":[{"name":"Shobanraj Navaratnarajah","affiliation":["University of Surrey"],"bio":{"p":["Shobanraj Navaratnarajah (s.navaratnarajah@surrey.ac.uk) received his BSc (Honours) degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from University of Moratuwa in 2007.

Clearly, availing of new spectrum (as with 4G allocations) is a necessary part of meeting this challenge, but so are improved network architectures that achieve enhanced spatial spectral efficiency (bits per second per Hertz per area). 4G network operators are moving toward a heterogeneous architecture consisting of overlaid cells of various sizes. A variety of low-power, small-cell base stations and relays are being deployed to increase capacity around local, typically indoor hotspots. The primary concern in such scenarios is understanding the nature and impact of inter-cell interference in dense deployments of such unmanaged small cells, and arriving at solutions for its mitigation. Resource allocation in traditional wide-area cellular networks usually assume a fully loaded network (i.e. many simultaneous active users in a cell) where the system performance is insensitive to the activity of a single user. This assumption is not suitable for femtocells which are designed to serve very few (indoor) users and thus lacks the presumed traffic aggregation. This article provides a fresh look at the femtocell interference problem from a multiple access perspective. It first compares the multi-channel features inherent to OFDMA with traditional multi-channel MAC designs for wireless LANs and highlights how the ability to schedule users in both time and frequency as afforded by OFDMA, can be exploited to achieve more effective (distributed) random access. A simplified MAC model that hides the complexity of LTE protocol stack is proposed to facilitate the design and analysis of random access MAC algorithms in the context of OFDMA femtocells.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The case for random access in OFDMA femtocells","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6664482","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6664461/06664482.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6664482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664482/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","displayDocTitle":"The case for random access in OFDMA femtocells","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6664482/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13914157","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The case for random access in OFDMA femtocells","sourcePdf":"021MUTAIRI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049607S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6664461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6664461","articleId":"6664482","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6664484,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-tuo Zhou","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"],"bio":{"p":["MING-Tuo Zhou [S'01, M'04, SM'11] (mingtuo@nict.com.sg) received his B.E. degree from Hunan University in 1997, his M.E. degree from Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2000, and his Ph.D. degree from Asian Institute of Technology in 2003.

The motivation for this project stems from the fact that there is an increasing need for low-cost and high-speed maritime communication, with demands mainly coming from regulatory and crew welfare needs. The system described in this article is a wireless mesh network based on the IEEE 802.16. An analysis of the node connectivity based on real ship traffic data shows that the network is feasible in shipping lanes with a high density of ships. The system also considers the use of an intelligent middleware to allow communications to switch back to a satellite link in cases where neighboring ships are sparse or at locations far away from mesh base stations. Protocol enhancements to both the Medium Access Control (MAC) and networking layers and a hardware design that features multiple transceivers and the implementation of antenna switching to counter sea wave reflection and rocking problems are presented. Measurements of field trials show that the proposed wireless mesh network could be an effective solution for maritime communications.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6664484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6664461/06664484.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6664484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TRITON: high-speed maritime wireless mesh network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664484/","displayDocTitle":"TRITON: high-speed maritime wireless mesh network","volume":"20","issue":"5","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13914151","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664484/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TRITON: high-speed maritime wireless mesh network","sourcePdf":"023ZHOU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068549S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6664461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6664461","articleId":"6664484","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6664485,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Lo","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Anthony Lo [SM] (anthonyLo@ieee.org) received combined B.

Cellular wireless technologies will be a potential candidate for providing the last mile M2M connectivity. Thus, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and IEEE 802.16p, have both specified an overall cellular M2M reference architecture. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), in contrast, has defined a service- oriented M2M architecture. This article reviews and compares the three architectures. As a result, the 3GPP and 802.16p M2M architectures, which are functionally equivalent, complement the ETSI one. Therefore, we propose to combine the ETSI and 3GPP architectures, yielding a cellular-centric M2M service architecture. Our proposed architecture advocates the use of M2M relay nodes as a data concentrator. The M2M relay implements a tunnel-based aggregation scheme which coalesces data from several machines destined to the same tunnel exit-point. The aggregation scheme is also employed at the M2M gateway and the cellular base station. Numerical results show a significant reduction in protocol overheads as compared to not using aggregation at the expense of packet delay. However, the delay rapidly decreases with increasing machine density.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cellular-centric service architecture for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6664485","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6664461/06664485.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6664485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664485/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","displayDocTitle":"A cellular-centric service architecture for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6664485/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13914154","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cellular-centric service architecture for machine-to-machine (M2M) communications","sourcePdf":"024LO_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035987S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6664461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6664461","articleId":"6664485","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6664539,"authors":[{"name":"Yanling Jin","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yanling","lastName":"Jin","id":"37672928200"},{"name":"Yongsheng Ding","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Ding","id":"37277996600"},{"name":"Kuangrong Hao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Donghua University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kuangrong","lastName":"Hao","id":"37300202600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6664539","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biochemistry","Sensors","Target tracking","Wireless sensor networks","Switches","Artificial neural networks","Endocrine system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object tracking","probability","target tracking","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","target tracking","WSN","novel bio-inspired distributed object-tracking approach","BDOA","endocrine system","human body","decentralized nodes","probability-based scheme","information exchange"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial endocrine system","Distributed sensor network","Object tracking"]}],"abstract":"Target tracking with the wireless sensor networks (WSN) has been an issue with plenty of potentiality and challenge. The rapid development of the biology has created a new way for extracting natural regulating mechanisms. In this paper, a novel bio-inspired distributed object-tracking approach (BDOA) based on the information circulating principle of the endocrine system of human body is proposed. The decentralized nodes can tune themselves spontaneously by exchanging information among their local neighbors. A probability-based scheme for the information exchange is introduced to guarantee the persistence of tracking towards invading objects and inhibit the status fluctuation of the network. Simulation shows that this decentralized network with the proposed BDOA can work in a stable status without guidance of central commands. For the tracking performance, the proposed BDOA outperforms the other algorithms and the tracking mission against the invading object can be accomplished more efficiently and persistently.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bio-inspired distributed object-tracking approach in wireless sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664539","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6637132/6664530/06664539.pdf","startPage":"1037","endPage":"1041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"A bio-inspired distributed object-tracking approach in wireless sensor networks","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"03","htmlLink":"/document/6664539/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13898192","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bio-inspired distributed object-tracking approach in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"300359d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069646S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6637132","isNumber":"6664530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6637132","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6664530","articleId":"6664539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6664551,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Cheng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38244007200"},{"name":"Kaikai Chi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Kaikai","lastName":"Chi","id":"37391336400"},{"name":"Xianzhong Tian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xianzhong","lastName":"Tian","id":"37715191300"},{"name":"Yanjun Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanjun","lastName":"Li","id":"37086683611"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6664551","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664551","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Cryptography","Pollution","Equations","Mathematical model","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","digital signatures","network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure network coding","homomorpuic signature","pollution attacks","network coding systems","forged messages","polluted messages","security protection","homomorphic signature scheme","Paillier cryptosystem","received messages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network coding","Secure","Homomorphic","signature","Pollution attacks","Paillier cryptosystem"]}],"abstract":"The network coding systems are vulnerable to pollution attacks, in which the adversary forwarders can inject polluted or forged messages into networks.

On one hand, it guarantees the forwarders to verify the received messages effectively. If the verification is failed, the message is assumed to be polluted and should be discarded. On the other hand, the proposed scheme can generate the valid signatures for its output messages from the signatures of input ones without knowing the source's private key such that extra secure channels are not needed. We also make the security analysis and prove that our signature scheme is secure enough to defend against pollution attacks.","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6637132/6664530/06664551.pdf","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1096","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure network coding based on homomorpuic signature against pollution attacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","displayDocTitle":"Secure network coding based on homomorpuic signature against pollution attacks","htmlLink":"/document/6664551/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13898179","isConference":true,"volume":"03","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure network coding based on homomorpuic signature against pollution attacks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"319710d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094458S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6637132","isNumber":"6664530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6637132","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6664530","articleId":"6664551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6664566,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyue Feng","affiliation":["Department of Automation Engineering, Military Transportation University, TianJin, China"],"firstName":"Mingyue","lastName":"Feng","id":"38481773900"},{"name":"Xiao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation Engineering, Military Transportation University, TianJin, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540119800"},{"name":"Yongjin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation Engineering, Military Transportation University, TianJin, China"],"firstName":"Yongjin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086728668"},{"name":"Jianshi Li","affiliation":["Department of Automation Engineering, Military Transportation University, TianJin, China"],"firstName":"Jianshi","lastName":"Li","id":"37086725090"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6664566","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective particle swarm optimization for resource allocation in cloud computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6637132/6664530/06664566.pdf","startPage":"1161","endPage":"1165","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664530","doi":"10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664566","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Particle swarm optimization","Processor scheduling","Job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","combinatorial mathematics","Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective particle swarm optimization","multiobjective optimal solutions","Pareto domination mechanism","QOS","resource reservation","total task executing time","task scheduler","combinatorial optimization problem","resource allocation","customer requirements","service provider","cloud computing field","Internet","computer technology","IT revolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation","particle swarm optimization","pareto-dominate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664566","abstract":"Cloud computing is now a hot topic of research that is assumed as the third revolution of IT after computer technology and the internet. In cloud computing field, a service-provider offers large number of resources like computing units, storage space and software etc for customers with a relatively low cost. As the number of customer increases, fulfilling their requirements may become an important yet intractable matter. Resource allocation is therefore a primary issue considered restriction in resource amount that could be afforded by a company. The problem of resource allocation in cloud computing is thought to be a combinatorial optimization problem to a large company for numbers of their customers and owned resources could be huge enough. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed for this problem. The algorithm aims at finding out a desired task scheduler on resources based on multiple considerations including total task executing time, resource reservation, and QOS of each task. Pareto-domination mechanism is introduced into the algorithm helping searching multi-objective optimal solutions. Experimental results verify effectiveness and efficiency of the presented algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13914541","htmlLink":"/document/6664566/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"03","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective particle swarm optimization for resource allocation in cloud computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective particle swarm optimization for resource allocation in cloud computing","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"338738d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067565S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6637132","isNumber":"6664530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6637132","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6664530","articleId":"6664566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6664584,"authors":[{"name":"Chenxu Wang","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chenxu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37578432300"},{"name":"Mingyan Yu","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085435311"},{"name":"Jinxiang Wang","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jinxiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292916300"},{"name":"Peihe Jiang","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Peihe","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086740733"},{"name":"Xiaochen Tang","affiliation":["Microelectronics Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochen","lastName":"Tang","id":"38550412800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-1857-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-1855-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-5933"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-595X"}],"articleNumber":"6664584","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Encryption","Hardware","Correlation","Logic gates","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["practical CPA attack method","present hardware implementation","ultra-lightweight block cipher","PRESENT","correlation power analysis attack","power consumption acquisition platform","secret key"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["present","lightweight blockcipher","power analysis attack","correlation power analysis (CPA)"]}],"abstract":"In CHES 2007, Bogdanov et al. proposed an ultra-lightweight block cipher named PRESENT, which has been included in the new international standard ISO/IEC 29192-2:2012.

But LDA has a shortcoming that it cannot deal with various changes of data set well, which has become a limitation for its applications. Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) is a generalization of LDA and it can adapt itself to the growing data set automatically. hLDA can mine latent topics from a large amount of discrete data and organize these topics into a hierarchy, in which the topics of higher level are more abstractive while the topics of lower level are more specific. This hierarchy could achieve a deeper semantic model which is similar with human mind. Given a set of documents, hLDA generates a prior distribution of Bayesian nonparametrics using a nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP)[1]. The documents sharing similar topics are organized into a cluster of path. hLDA learns the distribution of topics using a method of Bayesian posterior inference. This paper tries to study hLDA model in details and apply it into the application of Chinese text clustering. Experiments have shown that hLDA is a very promising model for text clustering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"13898117","htmlLink":"/document/6664628/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2012","isConference":true,"volume":"03","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"HLDA based text clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HLDA based text clustering","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"408824d.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03853S","chronDate":"Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6637132","isNumber":"6664530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6637132","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6664530","articleId":"6664628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6664666,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Chang Cheng","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Chang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37599228000"},{"name":"You-Song Xu","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"You-Song","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086759408"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5101-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-1164"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-1172"}],"articleNumber":"6664666","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mouth","Face","Cameras","Vehicles","Neural networks","Real-time systems","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","face recognition","image classification","neural nets","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time driver gaze direction detection","3D triangle model","neural networks","driver distraction monitoring","open CV","open source computer vision library","face location","eyes position location","mouth position location","stereo vision","depth information","driver awareness system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Driver distraction","Face detection","Eye detection","Mouth detection","Neural networks","Stereo Vision"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664666","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a real-time driver gaze direction detection system using a 3D triangle model and neural networks to monitor the driver's distraction.

It becomes a vital problem to achieve CB as the distributed nodes are unaware of their phase relationship. Therefore, an efficient phase synchronisation algorithm is needed as the distributed nodes are unaware of their phase relationship. In this paper, an iterative phase synchronisation algorithm using (1+1)-evolution strategy (ES) is proposed to achieve CB in WSNs.

devices. It is challenging for the service provider to cater to different kinds of upcoming new services and applications as data rates vary apart in that respect. For that reason, it is of paramount importance to adaptively utilize the radio resources which are limited and valuable. The ability of Orthogonal Frequency-division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA) to split the entire bandwidth into smaller sub-carriers allows adaptive resource allocation to be performed in downlink communications. However, due to the time-varying nature of the wireless channel, not all links experience the same channel response. Therefore, this situation is akin to a strategic combination problem to find the best allocation out of the huge combinations according the current channel characteristics. This paper presents an evolutionary method, particle swarm optimization (PSO), to optimally allocate the rates and sub carriers to multiple users. The results display good convergences towards the optimal solution for a minimal transmit power allocation. At transmission intervals, the cellular base station will be able to use the best allocation relating to channel conditions of any point in time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13900331","htmlLink":"/document/6664710/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Resource Allocation in Orthogonal Frequency-division Multiplexing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Resource Allocation in Orthogonal Frequency-division Multiplexing","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"5101a303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05206S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6663233","isNumber":"6664646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6663233","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6664646","articleId":"6664710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6664757,"authors":[{"name":"Kihyun Kim","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information and Communication, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kihyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086647265"},{"name":"Kwangki Ryoo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information and Communication, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwangki","lastName":"Ryoo","id":"37530372400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0892-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0890-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8143"}],"articleNumber":"6664757","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Computer architecture","Hardware","Logic gates","Throughput","Matrix decomposition","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS integrated circuits","transforms","UHF integrated circuits","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEVC","multimode 1D forward transform hardware architecture","multiplication coefficient","TU size","shifter","adder","TSMC CMOS process","QFHD","size 180 nm","frequency 400 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HEVC","Multi-mode 1-D Forward Transform"]}],"abstract":"This paper suggests an HEVC 1-D forward transform hardware architecture that supports four TU sizes (4\u00d74, 8\u00d78, 16\u00d716, and 32\u00d732) and yields high throughput.

Such methods are almost based on acoustic features extracted from raw audiocontent. Unfortunately, this processing step is extremely time intensive. Thus, the energy consumption of the underlying hardware architecture becomes critical especially for mobile devices. This paper presents a hardware accelerator that efficiently extracts features from audio data. The architecture is designed for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). Quantitative results confirm a speed up of up to factor 5 compared to an Intel Core i7 2640M CPU with a concurrent reduced power consumption of at least factor 7 regarding the FPGA implementation. Furthermore, the ASIC implementation is up to 70000 times more energy efficient than a CPU and is therefore suitable even for mobile devices.","doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2013.6664775","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 2nd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 2nd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653324/6664739/06664775.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2013.6664775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-accelerator design for energy-efficient acoustic feature extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664775/","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-accelerator design for energy-efficient acoustic feature extraction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13899355","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664775/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-accelerator design for energy-efficient acoustic feature extraction","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p135schmadecke.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082561S","chronDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653324","isNumber":"6664739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653324","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6664739","articleId":"6664775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6664782,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan Jen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuan Jen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291133400"},{"name":"Chien Chih Hou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien Chih","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086787298"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0892-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0890-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8143"}],"articleNumber":"6664782","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"abstract":"The CORDIC algorithm can be used to calculate the trigonometric functions and widely used in real time digital signal processing.

By combining multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques with the SC-FDMA modulation scheme, MIMO SC-FDMA systems can achieve high data rates over broadband wireless channels.

Simulation results show that the system performances can substantially be improved if the adaptive equalizer can properly utilize the extrinsic information from the turbo decoder.","doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2013.6664840","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 2nd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 2nd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653324/6664739/06664840.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2013.6664840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo OFDM-CDMA receiver with varying stepsize in multipath fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664840/","displayDocTitle":"Turbo OFDM-CDMA receiver with varying stepsize in multipath fading channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13914666","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664840/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo OFDM-CDMA receiver with varying stepsize in multipath fading channels","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p311wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070353S","chronDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653324","isNumber":"6664739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653324","xplore-issue":"6664739","articleId":"6664840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6664844,"authors":[{"name":"Feiyu Lu","affiliation":["Intelligent Computer Entertainment Laboratory, Ritsumeikan University"],"firstName":"Feiyu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086743929"},{"name":"Kaito Yamamoto","affiliation":["Intelligent Computer Entertainment Laboratory, Ritsumeikan University"],"firstName":"Kaito","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37085557301"},{"name":"Luis H.

Since the first chess programs were written, there has been steady progress in the level of play to the point where current systems can challenge top-class human players. Recently, academia groups have created competitions to evaluate and compare AI methods, such as Ms Pac-Man versus Ghost Team and Student StarCraft AI Tournament. Those tournaments define their rules and goals based on the game they selected, according to which intelligent techniques and technologies are developed. We focus on a genre called fighting game. Examples of fighting games are Street Fighter, Tekken, and Mortal Kombat. To select the winner in the fighting game is simple: the winner is the character with less damage or the last one standing. In this paper we introduce a brand new competition based on a 2D fighting game written in Java.","doi":"10.1109/GCCE.2013.6664844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6664739","startPage":"320","endPage":"323","pdfPath":"/iel7/6653324/6664739/06664844.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 2nd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 2nd Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCCE.2013.6664844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fighting game artificial intelligence competition platform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Artificial intelligence","Computational intelligence","Engines","Computers","Algorithm design and analysis","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","computer games","Java"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fighting game","artificial intelligence","game playing","AI algorithms","Street Fighter","Tekken","Mortal Kombat","Java"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial intelligence","AI","fighting game","contest","algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Fighting game artificial intelligence competition platform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664844/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6664844/","accessionNumber":"13899241","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","conferenceDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fighting game artificial intelligence competition platform","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"p320lu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042861S","chronDate":"1-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6653324","isNumber":"6664739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6653324","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6664739","articleId":"6664844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6664910,"authors":[{"name":"Masato Taniguchi","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu-shi, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Taniguchi","id":"37086757085"},{"name":"Mitsuru Shiozaki","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu-shi, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuru","lastName":"Shiozaki","id":"37282764100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kubo","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu-shi, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kubo","id":"37086756971"},{"name":"Takeshi Fujino","affiliation":["Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu-shi, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Fujino","id":"37291809000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0892-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0890-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-8143"}],"articleNumber":"6664910","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":392},"abstract":"Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) extract inherent characteristics caused by fabrication process variations, and generate unique challenge-response pairs.

Particularly challenging problem in this context is the spectral regrowth of nonlinear power amplifiers (PAs) in the transmit chain, and other transmitter out-of-band (OOB) emissions, which can heavily desensitize the receiver chain. In this letter, we first carry out detailed modeling of transmitter OOB emissions due to practical wideband PAs with memory effects. Stemming from this modeling, and using the known digital transmit data inside the transceiver as reference, we then propose an efficient nonlinear digital cancellation technique to suppress the transmitter OOB emissions in the receiver path. The proposed technique is verified and analyzed using extensive computer simulations, rendering excellent suppression properties, hence enabling sufficient TX-RX isolation in frequency division duplexing (FDD) transceivers without any extra analog/RF filtering or PA linearization.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6655913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2013.2291032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6655913/06664984.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"73","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2013.2291032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Suppression of Power Amplifier Spurious Emissions at Receiver Band in FDD Transceivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Digital Suppression of Power Amplifier Spurious Emissions at Receiver Band in FDD Transceivers","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6664984/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13913390","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Suppression of Power Amplifier Spurious Emissions at Receiver Band in FDD Transceivers","sourcePdf":"lsp-kiayani-2291032-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039709S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6655913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6655913","articleId":"6664984","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6664986,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Ruan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37085613931"},{"name":"Rodrigo C. de Lamare","affiliation":["CETUC/PUC-Rio, Brazil"],"firstName":"Rodrigo C.","lastName":"de Lamare","id":"37266614000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6664986","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1338},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Covariance matrices","Signal processing algorithms","Estimation","Member and Geographic Activities Board committees","Arrays","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","covariance matrices","geometry","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity robust adaptive beamforming technique","low-complexity shrinkage-based mismatch estimation algorithm","RAB technique","LOCSME algorithm","interference-plus-noise covariance matrix","INC matrix","oracle approximating shrinkage method","OAS method","antenna array geometry","optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Covariance matrix shrinkage method","low complexity methods","robust adaptive beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6664986","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2013.2290948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","abstract":"In this work, we propose a low-complexity robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) technique which estimates the steering vector using a Low-Complexity Shrinkage-Based Mismatch Estimation (LOCSME) algorithm.

LOCSME only requires prior knowledge of the angular sector in which the actual steering vector is located and the antenna array geometry. LOCSME does not require a costly optimization algorithm and does not need to know extra information from the interferers, which avoids direction finding for all interferers. Simulations show that LOCSME outperforms previously reported RAB algorithms and has a performance very close to the optimum.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2013.2290948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6655913","startPage":"60","endPage":"64","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6655913/06664986.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming Using a Low-Complexity Shrinkage-Based Mismatch Estimation Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6664986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6664986/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming Using a Low-Complexity Shrinkage-Based Mismatch Estimation Algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13913389","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming Using a Low-Complexity Shrinkage-Based Mismatch Estimation Algorithm","sourcePdf":"lsp-cdelamare-2290948-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043024S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6655913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6655913","articleId":"6664986","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6664996,"authors":[{"name":"Kin-Lu Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kin-Lu","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682300"},{"name":"Tseng-Wei Weng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tseng-Wei","lastName":"Weng","id":"37085412952"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6664996","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2239},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Wideband","Inductors","Tablet computers","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","broadband antennas","broadband networks","Long Term Evolution","microwave antennas","multifrequency antennas","planar antennas","radio networks","UHF antennas","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small-size triple-wideband LTE-WWAN tablet device antenna","Long Term Evolution-wireless wide area network operation","planar structure","thin FR4 substrate","coupled-fed shorted strip antenna","compact antenna structure","frequency 698 MHz to 960 MHz","frequency 1710 MHz to 2690 MHz","frequency 3400 MHz to 3800 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE/WWAN antennas","mobile antennas","multiwideband antennas","small-size antennas","tablet device antennas"]}],"abstract":"A small-size tablet device antenna with three wide operating bands to cover the Long Term Evolution/Wireless Wide Area Network (LTE/WWAN) operation in the 698 ~ 960-, 1710 ~ 2690-, and 3400 ~ 3800-MHz bands is presented.

A series of pilot experiments were conducted under multi-condition training with more than 100 hours of simulated speech data, resulting in a good generalization capability even in mismatched testing conditions. When compared with the logarithmic minimum mean square error approach, the proposed DNN-based algorithm tends to achieve significant improvements in terms of various objective quality measures.

Active memory expansion (AME), a technology to dynamically increase the effective memory capacity of a system by compressing and decompressing memory pages, is also enjoying increasing deployment in POWER server systems. Together, cryptography and AME consume enough central processing unit (CPU) cycles in a typical installation to warrant adding dedicated hardware accelerators on the processor chip to offload the compute-intensive parts of these functions from the processor cores. IBM POWER7+\u2122 is the first POWER server to include on-chip hardware accelerators for symmetric (shared key) and asymmetric (public key) cryptography and memory compression/decompression for AME. A true random number generator (RNG) is also integrated on-chip. This paper describes the hardware accelerator framework, including location relative to the cores and memory, accelerator invocation, data movement, and error handling. A description of each type of accelerator follows, including details of supported algorithms and the corresponding hardware data flows. Algorithms supported include the Advanced Encryption Standard, Secure Hash Algorithm, and Message Digest 5 algorithm as bulk cryptographic functions; asymmetric cryptographic functions in support of RSA and elliptic curve cryptography; and a novel dictionary-based compression algorithm with high throughput supporting AME.

By caching a portion of the video files at the relays (RS) using a novel MDS-coded random cache scheme, the base station (BS) and RSs opportunistically employ CoMP to achieve spatial multiplexing gain without expensive payload backhaul. We study a two timescale joint optimization of power and cache control to support real-time video streaming. The cache control is to create more CoMP opportunities and is adaptive to the long-term popularity of the video files. The power control is to guarantee the QoS requirements and is adaptive to the channel state information (CSI), the cache state at the RS and the queue state information (QSI) at the users. The joint problem is decomposed into an inner power control problem and an outer cache control problem. We first derive a closed-form power control policy from an approximated Bellman equation. Based on this, we transform the outer problem into a convex stochastic optimization problem and propose a stochastic subgradient algorithm to solve it. Finally, the proposed solution is shown to be asymptotically optimal for high SNR and small timeslot duration. Its superior performance over various baselines is verified by simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665021/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2014","volume":"62","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13998810","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6665021/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cache-Enabled Opportunistic Cooperative MIMO for Video Streaming in Wireless Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache-Enabled Opportunistic Cooperative MIMO for Video Streaming in Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2291211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143388S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6692980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6692980","articleId":"6665021","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6665022,"authors":[{"name":"Yongchang Zhang","affiliation":["Power Electronics and Motor Drives Engineering Research Center of Beijing, North China University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6824280/6665022/6665022-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongchang Zhang (M\u201910) received the B.S. degree from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009, both in electrical engineering.","From August 2009 to August 2011, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.

However, conventional FCS-MPC requires to evaluate a cost function for each discrete switching states, which poses high computational burden. This paper proposes a low-complexity MPC (LC-MPC), which only requires one prediction to find the best voltage vector. The principle of LC-MPC is inherited from prior direct current control (DCC), but has been generalized by identifying its advantages, limitations, and potential application areas. Furthermore, the relationship between LC-MPC and FCS-MPC is studied and it is found that in some cases, the LC-MPC is completely equivalent to FCS-MPC. This paper presents the application example of LC-MPC in power control of three-phase ac/dc converter. To make it a success, the negative conjugate of complex power in synchronous frame is selected as the control variable. Detailed principle of vector selection is introduced and the reason for requiring only one prediction in the proposed LC-MPC is strictly proven using mathematical tools. The proposed LC-MPC is compared with conventional FCS-MPC and its effectiveness is verified by both simulation and experimental results from a two-level ac/dc converter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Model Predictive Control\u2014Single Vector-Based Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2291005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6824280/06665022.pdf","startPage":"5532","endPage":"5541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2291005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824280","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Model Predictive Control\u2014Single Vector-Based Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6665022/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14362411","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51207003 and 51347004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"xx2013001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Model Predictive Control\u2014Single Vector-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2291005-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080383S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6824280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6824280","articleId":"6665022","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6665027,"authors":[{"name":"Guennadi Saiko","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/6587779/6665027/6665027-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guennadi Saiko was born in 1966 in Kiev, Ukraine.

Our results show that graphene can be a good candidate for the membrane of RF NEMS switches in applications where low actuation voltage and fast switching are required. The conductivity of the membrane is accurately modeled in the up- and down-state positions of the switch by considering the field effect of graphene. Rigorous full-wave simulations are then performed to obtain the scattering parameters of the switch. It is shown that graphene's conductivity variation due to electric field effect has a limited yet beneficial impact on the performance of the switch. It is also demonstrated that while monolayer graphene results in quite high switch losses at high frequency, the use of multilayer graphene, can considerably reduce the switch losses and improve the RF performance. Finally, an equivalent circuit model for the graphene-based RF NEMS switch is extracted and the results are compared with the full-wave 3-D electromagnetic simulation. These results motivate further efforts in the fabrication and characterization of graphene RF NEMS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/6704335/06665041.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2013.2290945","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2013.2290945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic Performance of RF NEMS Graphene Capacitive Switches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphene","Radio frequency","Nanoelectromechanical systems","Conductivity","Conductors","Nonhomogeneous media","Dielectrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical conductivity","equivalent circuits","graphene","monolayers","multilayers","nanoelectromechanical devices","nanofabrication","switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-wave 3-D electromagnetic simulation","equivalent circuit model","multilayer graphene","switch losses","monolayer graphene","electric field effect","scattering parameters","down-state position","up-state position","membrane conductivity","nanoelectromechanical systems","RF NEMS graphene capacitive switches","electromagnetic performance","C"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graphene","microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)","microwave","millimeter waves","nanoelectromechanical switch","RF nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic Performance of RF NEMS Graphene Capacitive Switches","volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6665041/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998600","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic Performance of RF NEMS Graphene Capacitive Switches","sourcePdf":"tnano-sharma-2290945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095896S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6704335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6704335","articleId":"6665041","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6665044,"authors":[{"name":"Seokhyun Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Dankook University, Yongin-si, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6832681/6665044/yoon-2291245-small.gif","p":["\nSeokhyun Yoon (S'95\u2013M'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in\nelectronics engineering from Sung Kyun Kwan University, Suwon, Korea, in 1992 and 1996, respectively, and the Ph.D.\ndegree in electrical and computer engineering from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA, in 2003.","In 1999, he was a Technical Staff Member with the Department of Broadcasting Technology, Electronics and\nTelecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea.

The pairwise graphical model is a bipartite graph where a pair of variable nodes are related by an observation node represented by the bivariate Gaussian function obtained by marginalizing the posterior joint probability density under the Gaussian input assumption. Specifically, we consider two types of pairwise models: the fully connected and ring-type. The pairwise graphs are sparse, compared with the conventional graphical model introduced by Bickson et al., insofar as the number of edges connected to an observation node (edge degree) is only two. Consequently, the computations are much easier than those of maximum likelihood (ML) detection, which are similar to the belief propagation (BP) that is run over the fully connected bipartite graph. The link level performance for non-Gaussian input is evaluated via simulations, and the results show the validity of the proposed algorithms. We also customize the algorithm with Gaussian input assumption to obtain the Gaussian BP run over the two pairwise graphical models, and for the ring-type, we prove its convergence to the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates. Since the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator for Gaussian input is equivalent to the linear MMSE estimator, it shows the optimality of the scheme for Gaussian input.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2291245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6832681/06665044.pdf","startPage":"2363","endPage":"2377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2291245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity MIMO Detection Based on Belief Propagation Over Pairwise Graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665044/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity MIMO Detection Based on Belief Propagation Over Pairwise Graphs","volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2014","accessionNumber":"14379478","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665044/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2012R1A1A2038807"},{"fundingName":"Dankook University Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity MIMO Detection Based on Belief Propagation Over Pairwise Graphs","sourcePdf":"tvt-chae-2291245-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099832S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6665044","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6665066,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah O.

The receiver is reconfigurable over a broadband to simultaneously receive two different signals with different modulation techniques and bandwidths. There are no limitations on the carrier frequencies of the two signals except that they have to be within the bandwidth of the six port receiver. The mathematical model for the receiver is derived and subsequently implemented to evaluate its performance. This approach shows that, by analytically choosing the frequencies of the two local oscillator signals sent into the six-port correlator, the in-phase (I) and the quadrature (Q) components of each of the two input RF signals can be obtained from the filtered high-pass and low-pass components of the diode detectors outputs. A black box model, which uses a modified memory polynomial, is used to calibrate the receiver. The calibration constants are estimated by sending a training signal of similar characteristics as the signal to be received. Two signals pairs with different modulation types are received to verify the model, and to evaluate the performance and test the robustness of the receiver. A 64-QAM signal at 2.5 GHz and a 16-QAM signal at 3.0 GHz, both with a data rate of 2 Mbps are received. The measured EVMs were 1.9% for the 64-QAM and 1.8% for the 16-QAM. Real communication signals, WCDMA and LTE were also received concurrently with measured EVMs of 1.9% and 2.0%, respectively. A bit error rate (BER) profile of the receiver for a 16QAM and 64QAM, both at 2Mbps is also plotted to evaluate the receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","volume":"61","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"13933800","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665066/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent Dual-Band Six-Port Receiver for Multi-Standard and Software Defined Radio Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent Dual-Band Six-Port Receiver for Multi-Standard and Software Defined Radio Applications","sourcePdf":"tmtt-olopade-2288690-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078674S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6677544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6677544","articleId":"6665066","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6665093,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Measurement results show that the antenna gain is enhanced by about 6.5 dB at 11.5 GHz, and its RCS is dramatically reduced in a broad frequency range from 6 to 14 GHz, compared with the traditional patch antenna without the PRS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6729042/06665095.pdf","startPage":"945","endPage":"949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2013.2291008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2013.2291008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6729042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-RCS and High-Gain Partially Reflecting Surface Antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Patch antennas","Antenna measurements","Gain","Reflector antennas","Radar cross-sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","Fabry-Perot resonators","microstrip antennas","radar cross-sections","slabs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar cross section","RCS","high-gain antenna","partially reflecting surface antenna","patch antenna","metallic patterns","dielectric slab","Fabry-Perot resonance cavity","ground plane","frequency 6 GHz to 14 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fabry-Perot cavity","gain enhancement","partially reflecting surface","radar cross section reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Low-RCS and High-Gain Partially Reflecting Surface Antenna","volume":"62","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6665095/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14078967","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-RCS and High-Gain Partially Reflecting Surface Antenna","sourcePdf":"tap-luo-2291008-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081347S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6729042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6729042","articleId":"6665095","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6665101,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Tzu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications Management and the Department of Transportation and Communication Management Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6832681/6665101/chen-2290991-small.gif","p":["\nWen-Tzu Chen (M'12) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering\nfrom National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1989 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National\nCheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1999.","From 1993 to 1995, he was with the National Education Broadcast Station as an Audio and RF Engineer.

However, due to the nonstationarity of wind power series, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, leading to increased uncertainties and risks for system operation. This paper proposes an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based probabilistic forecasting method for wind power generation. To account for the uncertainties in the forecasting results, several bootstrap methods have been compared for modeling the regression uncertainty, based on which the pairs bootstrap method is identified with the best performance. Consequently, a new method for prediction intervals formulation based on the ELM and the pairs bootstrap is developed. Wind power forecasting has been conducted in different seasons using the proposed approach with the historical wind power time series as the inputs alone. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation with a high potential for practical applications in power systems.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2287871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6799261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2287871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6799261/06665108.pdf","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation Using Extreme Learning Machine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation Using Extreme Learning Machine","volume":"29","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665108/","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239145","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665108/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation Using Extreme Learning Machine","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-xu-2287871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13448S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6799261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"390","xplore-issue":"6799261","articleId":"6665108","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6665112,"authors":[{"name":"Rasool Keshavarz","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6677544/6665112/6665112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rasool Keshavarz received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, in 2004, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran, in 2007, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.","His research interests are MTM, RF/microwave circuits design, and multi-standard systems.

terms of access speed, endurance, and compatibility to CMOS. However, high power supply voltage is required in the conventional STT-MRAM writing circuit, which results in high power consumption (e.g., ~10 pJ/bit). In addition, it suffers from stochastic switching behavior and process voltage temperature variations. These make power-efficient and reliable write/read circuits become critical challenges. In this paper, we present novel circuits and architectures to build a 16 kb STT-MRAM design with low power and high reliability. For example, the self-enable switching scheme reduces the power consumption effectively and the fore-placed sense amplifier improves the robustness to process variation. Using an accurate compact model of 65 nm STT-MRAM and a commercial CMOS design kit, mixed transient and statistical simulations have been performed to validate this design.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2291222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6786343/06665113.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2291222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6786343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 16 Kb Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory With Self-Enable Switching and Precharge Sensing Schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"A 16 Kb Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory With Self-Enable Switching and Precharge Sensing Schemes","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6665113/","accessionNumber":"14236893","volume":"50","issue":"4","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A 16 Kb Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory With Self-Enable Switching and Precharge Sensing Schemes","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhao-2291222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094579S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6786343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6786343","articleId":"6665113","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6665116,"authors":[{"name":"Chenglin Yang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6758430/6665116/6665116-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chenglin Yang received the Ph.D. degree in measurement technology and instruments from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.","His current research interests include design for testability, fault diagnosis, and test generation.","Mr. Yang was a reviewer of several internationally known journals such as the IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement and the International Journal of Circuit Theory and Applications.

These models cannot characterize all soft (parameter shifting) faults because that the parameter of analog element be of continuity character. To address this concern, a complex field fault modeling method is presented first. If fault happens to passive element xi in linear analog circuit, the real (U\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n) and imaginary (U\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</sub>\n) parts of faulty voltage phasor U\u00b0(U\u00b0=U\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n+j U\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</sub>\n) must satisfy binary quadratic function F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n(Ur,U\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</sub>\n)=0, which is independent from the value of element xi and uniquely determined by its location and the nominal circuit under test. Hence, the binary quadratic function can model any continuous parameter shifting (soft) or hard fault. Second, to avoid calculating the explicit expression of binary quadratic function, a simulation-based method is given to obtain the locus of the change in the function F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">z</sub>\n in the complex plane. Besides, the nominal (fault-free) point, the loci determined by the binary quadratic functions might intersect with each other. It is referred to as aliasing problem in this paper. This problem can be solved by adjusting the frequency of the input signal. Therefore, a constraint optimization method is proposed to select optimal test frequencies. The proposed test generation and compression methods, when combined with the complex field modeling method, can pinpoint much more fault components with less test points and frequencies when compared with the other methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Integrated circuit modeling","Fault diagnosis","Mathematical model","Analog circuits","Voltage measurement","Linear circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","circuit optimisation","fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test compression methods","test generation","optimal test frequency","constraint optimization method","input signal frequency","aliasing problem","hard fault","nominal circuit under test","binary quadratic function","faulty voltage phasor","passive element","continuity character","analog element parameter","soft fault","discretized parametric faults","linear analog circuit fault diagnosis","complex field fault modeling-based optimal frequency selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog circuit","fault diagnosis","fault dictionary","fault model","optimization","test frequencies selection"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6758430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2013.2289074","startPage":"813","endPage":"825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6758430/06665116.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2013.2289074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex Field Fault Modeling-Based Optimal Frequency Selection in Linear Analog Circuit Fault Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Complex Field Fault Modeling-Based Optimal Frequency Selection in Linear Analog Circuit Fault Diagnosis","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14145608","publicationDate":"April 2014","volume":"63","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665116/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex Field Fault Modeling-Based Optimal Frequency Selection in Linear Analog Circuit Fault Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tim-yang-2289074-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132072S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6758430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6758430","articleId":"6665116","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6665121,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Ministry of Education, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6809234/6665121/zhou-2291311-small.gif","p":["Liang Zhou (M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (E.N.S.), Cachan, France, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2009.","From 2009 to 2010 he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with ENSTA-ParisTech, Paris, France.

However, it is difficult, sometimes even impossible, to obtain this information in practice, especially for dynamic wireless networks. Thus, neither the distortion-minimum scheduling approaches aiming to meet the longterm video quality demands nor the solutions that focus on minimum delay can be applied directly. This motivates us to investigate the distributed wireless video scheduling with delayed control information (DCI). First, to exploit in a tractable framework, we translate this scheduling problem into a stochastic optimization rather than a convex optimization problem. Next, we consider two classes of DCI distributions: 1) the class with finite mean and variance and 2) a general class that does not employ any parametric representation. In each case, we study the relationship between the DCI and scheduling performance, and provide a general performance property bound for any distributed scheduling. Subsequently, a class of distributed scheduling scheme is proposed to achieve the performance bound by making use of the correlation among the time-scale control information. Finally, we provide simulation results to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the efficiency of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6665121/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267513","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Wireless Video Scheduling With Delayed Control Information","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"State Key Development Program of Basic Research of China","grantNumber":"2011CB302903"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61322104, 61201165 and 61271240"},{"fundingName":"Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions"},{"fundingName":"Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications Foundation","grantNumber":"NY211032"},{"fundingName":"Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Next Generation Networks and Applications Group, Portugal"},{"fundingName":"National Funding from the FCT-Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia through the PEst-OE/EEI/LA0008/2013 Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Wireless Video Scheduling With Delayed Control Information","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-zhou-2291311-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104108S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6809234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6809234","articleId":"6665121","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6665125,"authors":[{"name":"Jiening Zhan","affiliation":["Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jiening","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37529198100"},{"name":"Michael Gastpar","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gastpar","id":"37273006200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6665125","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional Forwarding of Channel State Information","abstract":"Based on the recent compute-and-forward technique , a novel communication strategy is proposed under which functions of the channel state information are forwarded along the network.

The proposed filter can smooth out high-contrast details while preserving major edges, which is not achievable for bilateral-filter-like techniques. Tree filter is a weighted-average filter, whose kernel is derived by viewing pixel affinity in a probabilistic framework simultaneously considering pixel spatial distance, color/intensity difference, as well as connectedness. Pixel connectedness is acquired by treating pixels as nodes in a minimum spanning tree (MST) extracted from the image. The fact that an MST makes all image pixels connected through the tree endues the filter with the power to smooth out high-contrast, fine-scale details while preserving major image structures, since pixels in small isolated region will be closely connected to surrounding majority pixels through the tree, while pixels inside large homogeneous region will be automatically dragged away from pixels outside the region. The tree filter can be separated into two other filters, both of which turn out to have fast algorithms. We also propose an efficient linear time MST extraction algorithm to further improve the whole filtering speed. The algorithms give tree filter a great advantage in low computational complexity (linear to number of image pixels) and fast speed: it can process a 1-megapixel 8-bit image at ~ 0.25 s on an Intel 3.4 GHz Core i7 CPU (including the construction of MST). The proposed tree filter is demonstrated on a variety of applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2291328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6685907/06665130.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2291328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6685907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tree Filtering: Efficient Structure-Preserving Smoothing With a Minimum Spanning Tree","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665130","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665130/","displayDocTitle":"Tree Filtering: Efficient Structure-Preserving Smoothing With a Minimum Spanning Tree","volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"13989819","pubMedId":"26270908","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665130/","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tree Filtering: Efficient Structure-Preserving Smoothing With a Minimum Spanning Tree","sourcePdf":"tip-yang-2291328-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149823S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6685907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6685907","articleId":"6665130","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6665138,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Y.

For the two-encoder Slepian-Wolf problem, we introduce a quantity known as the entropy dispersion matrix, which is analogous to the scalar dispersions that have gained interest recently. We prove a global dispersion result that can be expressed in terms of this entropy dispersion matrix and provides intuition on the approximate rate losses at a given blocklength and error probability. To gain better intuition about the rate at which the nonasymptotic rate region converges to the Slepian-Wolf boundary, we define and characterize two operational dispersions: 1) the local dispersion and 2) the weighted sum-rate dispersion. The former represents the rate of convergence to a point on the Slepian-Wolf boundary, whereas the latter represents the fastest rate for which a weighted sum of the two rates converges to its asymptotic fundamental limit. Interestingly, when we approach either of the two corner points, the local dispersion is characterized not by a univariate Gaussian, but a bivariate one as well as a subset of off-diagonal elements of the aforementioned entropy dispersion matrix. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our achievability proof technique by providing inner bounds for the multiple-access channel and the asymmetric broadcast channel in terms of dispersion matrices. All our proofs are unified by a so-called vector rate redundancy theorem, which is proved using the multidimensional Berry-Ess\u00e9en theorem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14040691","volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6665138/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Dispersions of Three Network Information Theory Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Dispersions of Three Network Information Theory Problems","sourcePdf":"tit-tan-2291231-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137808S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6714461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6714461","articleId":"6665138","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":6665149,"authors":[{"name":"Anssi Sinervo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Aalto, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Anssi Sinervo was born in Helsinki, Finland, in 1984.

Both measurement results and finite element computations are shown. In the measurements, the rotor is on a long flexible shaft supported by external bearings. The proposed control strategy allows the machine to run at all operation points (speed, torque) up to the rated values, including at the first critical speed caused by the first natural bending frequency of the rotor shaft. The power consumption of the radial position control and the total effect on efficiency is analyzed. Both rotor eccentricity and the produced four-pole field affect the losses of the machine.

The backscattered signal from the scatterer is affected by two distinct phenomena: early-time response which emanates from the scattering centers of the scatterer and late-time response which is the summation of the complex natural resonances (CNRs) with some weighting residues. Based on the singularity expansion method (SEM), CNRs are aspect-independent parameters which include some structural information of the scattering target. Based on this fact, the data can be embedded on the RFID tag as CNRs associated to the structural parameters. In this paper, a low-profile chipless RFID tag as a suitable device for high-density data is introduced. By incorporating several slots on the chipless RFID tag, the data can be encoded as CNRs on the structure. The designed RFID tag operates in the frequency band of 3.1-10.6 GHz. The data are decoded in the reader by applying short-time matrix pencil method (STMPM) to the transient backscattered response of the tag. In addition, the turn-on times, damping factors, and resonant frequencies of the poles are distinguished. After studying the effects of various parameters of the tag, a 24-bit tag is designed on the area of 24 \u00d7 24 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, simulated and measured. The measurement is performed in the frequency domain and, after applying inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), STMPM is employed to extract the signature of the tag. The tag is successfully read remotely via its scattered fields.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and

The design is based on implementation of two different types of subwavelength miniaturized-element frequency selective surfaces (MEFSS) backed by a thin grounded dielectric substrate. Two MEFSS structures are designed in such a way to produce reflection phase values with a difference of about 180\u00b0 (\u00b130\u00b0) over a wide frequency range. Segments of these surfaces are arranged in periodic and aperiodic fashions to distribute the scattered energy and minimize the maximum bistatic RCS of the underlying metallic surface over a wide range of incident angles at both polarizations. It is shown that the aperiodic NARR structure has 3-dB lower maximum bistatic RCS compared to the periodic one. The -6 dB bistatic RCS reduction bandwidth of 66% is achieved for both periodic and aperiodic NARR surfaces at the normal incidence. The monostatic RCS reduction level at normal incidence is the same for both structures, but the aperiodic NARR layer is shown to provide 13% higher -10 dB bandwidth. In addition, the performance of both structures for oblique angle of incidence up to 50 \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00b0</sup>\n is examined and is shown that the aperiodic NARR layer shows better performance in suppressing the RCS sidelobes. As a partial experimental validation, two prototypes of periodic and aperiodic NARR layers are fabricated and their monostatic RCS reduction are characterized experimentally.

The proposed RAS schemes maximize the minimum of the two overall end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. In the first RAS scheme, transmit and receive beamforming (BF) is adopted at the two sources using all antennas. In the second RAS scheme, transmit and receive antenna selection (AS) is adopted at the two sources using one antenna. To conduct a performance comparison of the proposed RAS-BF and RAS-AS schemes, we first derive new expressions for the exact outage probability over independent but not necessarily identically distributed Nakagami-m fading channels. We then derive new closed-form lower and upper bounds on the outage probability to offer an efficient computation. We further derive new compact expressions for the asymptotic outage probability to characterize the performance in the high-SNR regime. Notably, we demonstrate that RAS-BF and RAS-AS achieve the full outage diversity order of min{N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</sub>\nN\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RmA</sub>\n, N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</sub>\nN\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RmB</sub>\n}, where m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</sub>\n and m\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</sub>\n denote the Nakagami-m fading parameters between the N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</sub>\n-antenna source and relay and between the N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</sub>\n-antenna source and relay, respectively. Based on asymptotic results, we determine a concise solution for the optimal power allocation among the sources and the relay to maximize the performance under the assumption that both the sources have the same transmit power. To quantify the effect of spatial correlation at the sources, we derive new closed-form expressions for the asymptotic outage probability over correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. The results indicate that the spatial correlation has no impact on the outage diversity order but significantly deteriorates the outage array gain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Antenna Selection in MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks Over Nakagami- - Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2291323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6832681/06665157.pdf","startPage":"2349","endPage":"2362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2291323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832681","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","displayDocTitle":"Relay Antenna Selection in MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks Over Nakagami- <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula> Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6665157/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","publicationDate":"Jun 2014","accessionNumber":"14379489","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Antenna Selection in MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks Over Nakagami- <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex-math></inline-formula> Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2291323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096703S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6665157","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6665158,"authors":[{"name":"R.

To enhance the drain efficiency of the CMCS PA, the chip-on-board (COB) technique, which can reduce the external parasitic components of the packaged transistor and allow fast switching operation at high frequencies by minimizing distortion of the pulse waveform, is adopted. Also, GaN Schottky barrier diodes are fabricated in-house to protect the switching transistor against the high negative voltage swing. The differential output filter and balun composed of lumped LC resonators are integrated at the back of the switching transistor to extract amplified LTE signal from the output rectangular waveform, and the fabricated CMCS PA is measured and analyzed at four different states of BPDSM according to the coding efficiency from different input power level to obtain higher power and efficiency. Finally, a cavity bandpass filter (BPF) is added to the output circuit for a more accurate reduction of the harmonics and out-of-band noise signals to enhance system efficiency. From the measured results for an 8.5-dB PAPR 3 G LTE 10-MHz input signal, the proposed CMCS PA has a maximum average output power of 37.61 and 30.78 dBm, and the resulting drain efficiencies of 33.3% and 38.6% with the drain voltage of 19 and 7 V, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2288084","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2288084","startPage":"4168","endPage":"4178","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6677544/06665160.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Current-Mode Class-S Power Amplifier With GaN Schottky Diode Using Chip-On-Board Technique for 955 MHz LTE Signal","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Current-Mode Class-S Power Amplifier With GaN Schottky Diode Using Chip-On-Board Technique for 955 MHz LTE Signal","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2013","volume":"61","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665160/","accessionNumber":"13933802","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665160/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Current-Mode Class-S Power Amplifier With GaN Schottky Diode Using Chip-On-Board Technique for 955 MHz LTE Signal","sourcePdf":"tmtt-yook-2288084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104136S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6677544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6677544","articleId":"6665160","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6665177,"authors":[{"name":"Weirong Jiang","affiliation":["Xilinx Research Labs San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Weirong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086740378"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1641-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1640-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6665177","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1353},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Vectors","Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Memory management","Hardware","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","memory architecture","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA","range-to-ternary conversion","explicit range matching","small-size RAM-based TCAM units","scalable random access memory","deep priority encoding","on-chip resource usage","FPGA-based TCAM designs","field programmable gate array","reconfigurable hardware","search functions","network infrastructure","scalable ternary content addressable memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","RAM","TCAM"]}],"abstract":"Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) is widely used in network infrastructure for various search functions. There has been a growing interest in implementing TCAM using reconfigurable hardware such as Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Most of existing FPGA-based TCAM designs are based on brute-force implementations, which result in inefficient on-chip resource usage. As a result, existing designs support only a small TCAM size even with large FPGA devices. They also suffer from significant throughput degradation in implementing a large TCAM, mainly caused by deep priority encoding. This paper presents a scalable random access memory (RAM)-based TCAM architecture aiming for efficient implementation on state-of-the-art FPGAs. We give a formal study on RAM-based TCAM to unveil the ideas and the algorithms behind it. To conquer the timing challenge, we propose a modular architecture consisting of arrays of small-size RAM-based TCAM units. After decoupling the update logic from each unit, the modular architecture allows us to share each update engine among multiple units. This leads to resource saving. The capability of explicit range matching is also offered to avoid range-to-ternary conversion for search functions that require range matching. Implementation on a Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGA shows that our design can support a large TCAM of up to 2.4 Mbits while sustaining high throughput of 150 million packets per second. The resource usage scales linearly with the TCAM size. The architecture is configurable, allowing various performance trade-offs to be exploited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first FPGA design that implements a TCAM larger than 1 Mbits.","doi":"10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665177","publicationTitle":"Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648480/6665163/06665177.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6665163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Ternary Content Addressable Memory implementation using FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Ternary Content Addressable Memory implementation using FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665177/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13915538","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665177/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Ternary Content Addressable Memory implementation using FPGAs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p071jiang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103285S","chronDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648480","isNumber":"6665163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648480","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6665163","articleId":"6665177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6665178,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Huang","affiliation":["CAS, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37067262700"},{"name":"Linxuan Ding","affiliation":["Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Linxuan","lastName":"Ding","id":"37086676744"},{"name":"Gaogang Xie","affiliation":["CAS, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gaogang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37287269100"},{"name":"Dafang Zhang","affiliation":["Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Dafang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279212900"},{"name":"Alex X.

Previous TCAM-based RegEx matching algorithms a priori assume that a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) can be built for a given set of RegEx patterns. However, practical RegEx patterns contain complex terms like wildcard closure and repeat character, and it may be impossible to build a DFA with a reasonable number of states. This results in prior work to being infeasible in practice. Moreover, TCAM-based RegEx matching is required to scale to a large-scale set of RegEx patterns. In this paper, we propose a compressed finite automaton implementation called (CFA) for scalable TCAM-based RegEx matching. CFA is designed to reduce TCAM space by using three compression techniques: transition, character, and state compressions. Experiments on realistic RegEx pattern sets show CFA highly outperforms previous solutions in terms of TCAM space, matching throughput, and TCAM power consumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable TCAM-based regular expression matching with compressed finite automata","publicationTitle":"Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","doi":"10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665178","displayPublicationTitle":"Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648480/6665163/06665178.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6665163","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Scalable TCAM-based regular expression matching with compressed finite automata","conferenceDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665178/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901696","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable TCAM-based regular expression matching with compressed finite automata","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p083huang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06908S","chronDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648480","isNumber":"6665163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648480","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6665163","articleId":"6665178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6665189,"authors":[{"name":"Valentine A.

The wireless links from one relay node to another experience Nakagami- m fading, and the number of interferers per hop is Poisson distributed. The aggregate interference at each relay node is modeled as a shot-noise process whose distribution follows an \u03b1-stable process. For the considered system, analytical expressions for the moments of the end-to-end signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), the end-to-end outage probability (OP), the average bit-error probability (ABEP), and the average channel capacity are obtained. General asymptotic expressions for the end-to-end ABEP are also derived. The results provide useful insights regarding the factors affecting the performance of the considered system.

Algorithmic solutions have focused on high throughput; however, supporting dynamic updates has been challenging. In this paper, we present a 2-dimensional pipelined architecture for packet classification on FPGA, which achieves high throughput while supporting dynamic updates. Fine grained processing elements are arranged in a 2-dimensional array; each processing element accesses its designated memory locally, resulting in a scalable architecture. The entire array is both horizontally and vertically pipelined. As a result, it supports high clock rate that does not deteriorate as the length of the packet header or the size of the rule set increases. The performance of the architecture does not depend on rule set features such as the number of unique values in each field. The architecture also efficiently supports range searches in individual fields. The total memory is proportional to the rule set size. Dynamic updates- modify, delete and insert operations for the rule set during run-time are also supported on the self-reconfigurable processing elements with very little impact on the sustained throughput. Experimental results show that, for a 1K 15-tuple rule set, a state-of-the-art FPGA can sustain 190Gbps throughput with 1million updates/second. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any packet classification approach that simultaneously supports both high throughput and dynamic updates of the rule set. Our architecture demonstrates 4\u00d7 energy efficiency while achieving 2\u00d7 throughput compared to TCAM.","doi":"10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665195","publicationTitle":"Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648480/6665163/06665195.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6665163","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance architecture for dynamically updatable packet classification on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665195/","displayDocTitle":"High-performance architecture for dynamically updatable packet classification on FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665195/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","conferenceDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901697","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance architecture for dynamically updatable packet classification on FPGA","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p125qu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093809S","chronDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648480","isNumber":"6665163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648480","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6665163","articleId":"6665195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6665202,"authors":[{"name":"Xinming Chen","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Xinming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37074240300"},{"name":"Brandon Jones","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Jones","id":"37085774421"},{"name":"Michela Becchi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Michela","lastName":"Becchi","id":"37703614000"},{"name":"Tilman Wolf","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tilman","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37281966000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1641-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1640-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6665202","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Automata","Doped fiber amplifiers","Layout","Program processors","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet","pattern matching","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["picking pesky parameters","regular expression matching optimization","network security systems","packet payloads","line rate","rule sets","traffic patterns","power consumption","processors","field programmable gate arrays","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network security","deep packet inspection","deterministic finite automaton","non-deterministic finite automaton","regular expressions","design space exploration"]}],"abstract":"Network security systems inspect packet payloads for signatures of attacks. These systems use regular expression matching at their core. Many techniques for implementing regular expression matching at line rate have been proposed. Solutions differ in the type of automaton used (i.e., deterministic vs. non-deterministic) and in the configuration of implementation-specific parameters. While each solution has been shown to perform well on specific rule sets and traffic patterns, there has been no systematic comparison across a large set of solutions, rule sets and traffic patterns. Thus, it is extremely challenging for a practitioner to make an informed decision within the plethora of existing algorithmic and architectural proposals. To address this problem, we present a comprehensive evaluation of a broad set of regular expression matching techniques. We consider both algorithmic and architectural aspects. Specifically, we explore the performance, area requirements, and power consumption of implementations targeting processors and field programmable gate arrays using rule sets of practical size and complexity. We present detailed performance results and specific guidelines for determining optimal configurations based on a simple evaluation of the rule set. These guidelines can help significantly when implementing regular expression matching systems in practice.","doi":"10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665202","publicationTitle":"Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648480/6665163/06665202.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANCS.2013.6665202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6665163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Picking pesky parameters: Optimizing regular expression matching in practice","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665202","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665202/","displayDocTitle":"Picking pesky parameters: Optimizing regular expression matching in practice","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901689","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665202/","conferenceDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Picking pesky parameters: Optimizing regular expression matching in practice","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p203chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116981S","chronDate":"21-22 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648480","isNumber":"6665163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648480","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6665163","articleId":"6665202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6665286,"authors":[{"name":"Shengming Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shengming Li","id":"37086752436"},{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ying Wang","id":"37086013115"},{"name":"Xuesong Qiu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xuesong Qiu","id":"37289437200"},{"name":"Deyuan Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Deyuan Wang","id":"37086683330"},{"name":"Lijun Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lijun Wang","id":"37086733799"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-8855-2279-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6665286","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["workload prediction-based multi-VM provisioning mechanism","virtual machines","cloud computing","enterprise organizations","IaaS","infrastructure-as-a-service","VM resources","time-based billing model","VM provisioning scheme","ARIMA-DEC","ARIMA workload predictor with dynamic error compensation","SLA default rate","service level agreement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","IaaS","workload prediction","multi-VM provisioning"]}],"abstract":"With the emerging of cloud computing, more and more enterprise organizations begin to migrate their applications to IaaS, which is a more flexible and cheaper alternative to traditional infrastructures. IaaS providers usually offer customers with resources in the form of VM and charge them in a time-based billing model. Meanwhile customers are allowed to dynamically apply for VM resources. However, highly dynamic workload makes customers difficultly determine how much capacity to provision. Furthermore, it is also a great challenge for customers to determine how to choose a VM provisioning scheme to match workload at a low cost. In this paper, we propose a workload prediction-based multi-VM provisioning mechanism to overcome these challenges, which contains an ARIMA workload predictor with dynamic error compensation (ARIMA-DEC) and a time-based billing aware multi-VM provisioning algorithm (TBAMP). The experimental results show that ARIMA-DEC predictor can obviously reduce SLA default rate and TBAMP algorithm can effectively save rental cost comparing to the existing algorithms.","publicationTitle":"2013 15th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 15th Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6648475/6665205/06665286.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6665205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A workload prediction-based multi-VM provisioning mechanism in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665286/","displayDocTitle":"A workload prediction-based multi-VM provisioning mechanism in cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901615","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665286/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A workload prediction-based multi-VM provisioning mechanism in cloud computing","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"TS82116168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049119S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6648475","isNumber":"6665205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6648475","xplore-issue":"6665205","articleId":"6665286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6665325,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios S.

Based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, our study shows that J48 classifier is more efficient than the multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier trained with resilient backpropagation training algorithm (RPROP) where it achieves close to perfect detection rate (over 99%) with reasonable training time in acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. We also show that the performance of the MIMO relaying broadcast network is remarkably better than the traditional MIMO one.","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2013.111113.130655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6746479/06665327.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"53","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2013.111113.130655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation Recognition for MIMO Relaying Broadcast Channels with Direct Link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665327/","displayDocTitle":"Modulation Recognition for MIMO Relaying Broadcast Channels with Direct Link","volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14115629","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665327/","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation Recognition for MIMO Relaying Broadcast Channels with Direct Link","sourcePdf":"050-wcl1402-chikha.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072866S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6746479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6746479","articleId":"6665327","onlineDate":"14 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6665347,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Han","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, P.

This unfortunately leads to more unexpected variations and faults in system. In particular, the transient errors and hardware permanent faults have rapidly become the key constraint for large-scale network design. This increasing tendency highlights the incorporation of fault-tolerant solutions for Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture. In this paper we propose a Reliable Partial-Redundancy-based router architecture (REPAIR). The proposed scheme merely utilizes an additional buffer and a bus to enhance the connectivity of the data path in router. Meanwhile, REPAIR also employs error control coding (ECC) modules and decision-table-based (DT) control logic to implement an efficient online diagnosis and reconfigurable mechanism respectively. The experimental results show the good ability of REPAIR to tolerate hard faults under a high fault rates. Specifically, the silicon protection factor (SPF) of individual router reaches 16.34 and over 95% packets still can be successfully transferred in 16x16 torus network with 650 faults.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel7/6663375/6665328/06665360.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"177","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2013.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2013.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6665328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"REPAIR: A Reliable Partial-Redundancy-Based Router in NoC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Error correction codes","Ports (Computers)","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision tables","error correction codes","network routing","network-on-chip","protection","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["REPAIR","reliable partial-redundancy-based router","NoC","network-on-chip architecture","buffer","bus","data path","error control coding modules","decision-table-based control logic","online diagnosis","reconfigurable mechanism","fault rates","silicon protection factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"REPAIR: A Reliable Partial-Redundancy-Based Router in NoC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665360/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13916538","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REPAIR: A Reliable Partial-Redundancy-Based Router in NoC","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"5034a173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078667S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6663375","isNumber":"6665328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6663375","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6665328","articleId":"6665360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-28"},{"_id":6665361,"authors":[{"name":"Dabin Fang","affiliation":["State-Key Laboratory of ASIC and System Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dabin","lastName":"Fang","id":"37086758712"},{"name":"Huikai Li","affiliation":["State-Key Laboratory of ASIC and System Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Huikai","lastName":"Li","id":"37600671800"},{"name":"Jun Han","affiliation":["State-Key Laboratory of ASIC and System Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Han","id":"37085475229"},{"name":"Xiaoyang Zeng","affiliation":["State-Key Laboratory of ASIC and System Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37085347336"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5034-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6665361","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"abstract":"The attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) violate the security of Network-on-Chip (NoC) which emerges as a promising solution for multi-core system. In this paper, we explore the robustness of mesh-based NoC architecture under various flooding-based DoS attacks. Simulation results reveal that the robustness of NoC architecture can be correlated with parameters such as routing algorithm, the number and positions of attacked nodes. It indicates that deterministic routing algorithm xy will result in less performance degradation than using other four adaptive routing algorithms studied in this paper when the attack traffic rate is lower than 0.65. However, the opposite conclusion can be made if much higher attack traffic rate is used. The performance degradation would escalate with the increasing number of at-tacked nodes. Moreover, the locations of attacked nodes will have an impact on the degree of performance degradation. Last but not least, some design guidelines for NoC against DoS attacks are proposed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel7/6663375/6665328/06665361.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"186","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Eighth International Conference on Networking, Architecture and Storage","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2013.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2013.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6665328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness Analysis of Mesh-Based Network-on-Chip Architecture under Flooding-Based Denial of Service Attacks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crime","Routing","Robustness","Bandwidth","Throughput","Algorithm design and analysis","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","network routing","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["attack traffic rate","performance degradation","attacked node positions","attacked node number","routing algorithm","mesh-based NoC architecture","flooding-based denial of service attacks","mesh-based network-on-chip architecture","robustness analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip","Denial of Service","routing algorithm","robustness","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Robustness Analysis of Mesh-Based Network-on-Chip Architecture under Flooding-Based Denial of Service Attacks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665361/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13916504","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness Analysis of Mesh-Based Network-on-Chip Architecture under Flooding-Based Denial of Service Attacks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"5034a178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051316S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6663375","isNumber":"6665328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6663375","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6665328","articleId":"6665361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6665385,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Shuyan","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Shuyan","id":"37395008500"},{"name":"Shu Ruo","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Ruo","id":"37086789990"},{"name":"Li Shibao","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Shibao","id":"37086794192"},{"name":"Gu Zhaozhi","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Gu","lastName":"Zhaozhi","id":"37541287000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5034-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6665385","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","Computational complexity","Vectors","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","OFDM modulation","optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization algorithm","PAPR reduction","OFDM system","partial transmit sequence","PTS","distortionless technique","peak-to-average power ratio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","scrambling sequences","tabu search algorithm","computational complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","peak-to-average power ratio","Tabu search","partial transmit sequence"]}],"abstract":"Partial transmit sequence (PTS) is a distortionless technique used to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

The spectra were pretreated by autoscaling and Savitzky - Golay smoothing (the window size is 5, the polynomial order is 3), and a comparison of two pretreatment methods for the classified accuracy was implemented. The results showed that the identification accuracy of 97.84\u00b11.62% could be accomplished by using the pretreatment methods of autoscaling and EOSC, which is higher than the classified accuracy of 87.45 \u00b1 3.03% by using Savitzky - Golay smoothing method.

The developed procedure can be easily implemented for controlling quality in rhubarb production.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectroscopy","Absorption","Support vector machines","Accuracy","Time-domain analysis","Predictive models","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biotechnology","least squares approximations","production engineering computing","quality control","smoothing methods","spectrochemical analysis","support vector machines","terahertz wave spectra","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["official rhubarb sample identification","least square support vector machine","terahertz time-domain spectroscopy","THz-TDS","emphatic orthogonal signal correction","EOSC","LS-SVM","qualitative analysis model","bootstrapped Latin-partition","autoscaling","Savitzky Golay smoothing","nondestructive approach"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2013.6665431","publicationTitle":"2013 38th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 38th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6654602/6665392/06665431.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6665392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRMMW-THz.2013.6665431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of official rhubarb samples based on THz spectra and least squares support vector machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6665431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Identification of official rhubarb samples based on THz spectra and least squares support vector machine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6665431/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6665431/","accessionNumber":"13915989","conferenceDate":"1-6 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of official rhubarb samples based on THz spectra and least squares support vector machine","confLoc":"Mainz, Germany","sourcePdf":"MOP14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089725S","chronDate":"1-6 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6654602","isNumber":"6665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6654602","xplore-issue":"6665392","articleId":"6665431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6665444,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The temperature rises were verified by testing a motor on an ASD using a \u201cBack to Back\u201d ASD/Motor arrangement in a specially set up off site arrangement, with the base power available being an 800 kVA alternator. In the particular application, the temperature rises were not excessive and the predicted loss of insulation life due to the higher insulation temperatures for brief times involved would not be excessive.

However, this method induces blocklike artifacts in the image. One approach suggested, synthetic transmit beamforming (STB), involves overlapping transmit beams which are then interpolated to remove the MLA blocking artifacts. Independently, the application of minimum variance (MV) beamforming has been suggested in the context of MLA. We demonstrate here that each approach is only a partial solution and that combining them provides a better result than applying either approach separately. This is demonstrated by using both simulated and real phantom data, as well as cardiac data.

The subharmonic response can be improved by using wideband and long-duration signals. However, for sinusoidal tone-burst excitation, the effective bandwidth of the signal is inversely proportional to the signal duration. Linear frequency-modulated (LFM) and nonlinear frequencymodulated (NLFM) chirp excitations allow independent control over the signal bandwidth and duration; therefore, in this study LFM and NLFM signals were used for the insonation of microbubble populations. The amplitude modulation of the excitation waveform was achieved by applying different window functions. A customized window was designed for the NLFM chirp excitation by focusing on reducing the spectral leakage at the subharmonic frequency and increasing the subharmonic generation from microbubbles. Subharmonic scattering from a microbubble population was measured for various excitation signals and window functions. At a peak negative pressure of 600 kPa, the generated subharmonic energy by ultrasound contrast agents was 15.4 dB more for NLFM chirp excitation with 40% fractional bandwidth when compared with tone-burst excitation. For this reason, the NLFM chirp with a customized window was used as an excitation signal to perform subharmonic imaging in an ultrasound flow phantom. Results showed that the NLFM waveform with a customized window improved the subharmonic contrast by 4.35 \u00b1 0.42 dB on average over a Hann-windowed LFM excitation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2852","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/6666062/06666074.pdf","startPage":"2532","endPage":"2544","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of amplitude modulation on subharmonic imaging with chirp excitation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"The effect of amplitude modulation on subharmonic imaging with chirp excitation","volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6666074/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13930798","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","pubMedId":"24297019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of amplitude modulation on subharmonic imaging with chirp excitation","sourcePdf":"t13c2532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101413S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6666062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6666062","articleId":"6666074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6666083,"authors":[{"name":"Alice Daniels","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing and Materials, Cranfield University, Cranfield, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6666062/6666083/6666083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alice Daniels was born in Chertsey, Surrey, England, in 1986.

With a large number of transmissions comes a low image frame rate. When using classical transmission techniques, as in two-dimensional imaging, the frame rate becomes unacceptably low, prompting the use of alternative transmission patterns that require less time. One alternative is to use a multi-line transmission (MLT) technique which consists of transmitting several pulses simultaneously in different directions. Perturbations appear when acquiring and beamforming the signal in the direction of one pulse because of the pulses sent in other directions. The edge waves from the pulses transmitted in a different direction add to the signal transmitted in the direction of interest, resulting in artifacts in the final image. Taking advantage of the nonlinear propagation of sound in tissue, the second-harmonic signal can be used with the MLT technique. The image obtained using the second-harmonic signal, compared with an image obtained using the fundamental signal, should have reduced artifacts coming from other pulses transmitted simultaneously. Simulations, backed up by experiments imaging a wire target and an in vivo left ventricle, confirm that the hypothesis is valid. In the studied case, the perturbations appear as an increase in the signal level around the main echo of a point scatterer. When using the fundamental signal, the measured amplitude level of the perturbations was approximately -40 dB compared with the maximum signal amplitude (-27 dB in vivo), whereas it was around -60 dB (-45 dB in vivo) for the second-harmonic signal. The MLT technique encounters limitations in the very near field where the pulses overlap and the perturbation level also increases for images with strong speckle and low contrast.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correspondence - Multi-line transmission in medical imaging using the second-harmonic signal","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2868","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/6666062/06666090.pdf","startPage":"2682","endPage":"2692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666062","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Correspondence - Multi-line transmission in medical imaging using the second-harmonic signal","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6666090/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13930807","pubMedId":"24297034","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correspondence - Multi-line transmission in medical imaging using the second-harmonic signal","sourcePdf":"t13c2682.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144363S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6666062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6666062","articleId":"6666090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666095,"authors":[{"name":"Derrick Wing Kwan Ng","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Derrick Wing Kwan","lastName":"Ng"},{"name":"Lin Xiang","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37085542039"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666095","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":757},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Energy harvesting","Resource management","Optimization","Noise","Vectors","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","computational complexity","concave programming","energy harvesting","inductive power transmission","MIMO communication","quality of service","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective beamforming","communication security","wireless information","wireless power transfer","multiuser multiple-input single-output downlink system","MIS-O downlink system","multiobjective optimization problem","power allocation algorithm design","total transmit power minimization","energy harvesting efficiency maximization","quality of service","QoS","system secrecy capacity","artificial noise","nonconvex optimization problem","semidefinite programming relaxation approach","SDP relaxation approach","global optimal solution","sufficient condition","computational complexity","suboptimal power allocation schemes"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study power allocation for secure communication in a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MIS-O) downlink system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. The receivers are able to harvest energy from the radio frequency when they are idle. We propose a multi-objective optimization problem for power allocation algorithm design which incorporates two conflicting system objectives: total transmit power minimization and energy harvesting efficiency maximization. The proposed problem formulation takes into account a quality of service (QoS) requirement for the system secrecy capacity. Our designs advocate the dual use of artificial noise in providing secure communication and facilitating efficient energy harvesting. The multi-objective optimization problem is non-convex and is solved by a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach which results in an approximate of solution. A sufficient condition for the global optimal solution is revealed and the accuracy of the approximation is examined. To strike a balance between computational complexity and system performance, we propose two suboptimal power allocation schemes. Numerical results not only demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed suboptimal schemes compared to baseline schemes, but also unveil an interesting trade-off between energy harvesting efficiency and total transmit power.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666095","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666095.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective beamforming for secure communication in systems with wireless information and power transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective beamforming for secure communication in systems with wireless information and power transfer","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666095/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901812","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666095/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective beamforming for secure communication in systems with wireless information and power transfer","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p7ng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057704S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6666096,"authors":[{"name":"D\u017eevdan Kapetanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Center for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"D\u017eevdan","lastName":"Kapetanovi\u0107","id":"37887626700"},{"name":"Gan Zheng","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Center for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Gan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37291760700"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Ottersten","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Center for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Ottersten","id":"37266309700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666096","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Training","MIMO","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","phase shift keying","precoding","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot contamination attack detection","random training","massive MIMO system","channel estimation attacks","legitimate transmit precoder design","received signal quality","phase-shift keying symbols","PSK","detection probability","eavesdropper power","random pilots"]}],"abstract":"Channel estimation attacks can degrade the performance of the legitimate system and facilitate eavesdropping.

In the 3D channel modeling, besides the azimuth angles, the multipath components of a receive-transmit pair are determined by elevation angles, correlations between elevation and azimuth, and the 3D configurations of a user equipment's (UE) location and velocity. The 3D channel characteristics for an active antenna system (AAS) are studied in terms of aggregated array gain and channel covariance matrix. The 3D channel model is generated and examined through Monte Carlo simulations and a comparison of fixed vertical beamforming and adaptive vertical beamforming is presented. The comparison shows that adaptive vertical beamforming can potentially provide up to 8dB improvement in coupling loss. In addition, it is shown that for line-of-sight (LoS) the 3D channel covariance matrix can be decoupled into two independent covariance matrices with reduced sizes that effectively leads to reduced feedback overhead. For non-line-of-sight (NLoS), the correlation-based Kronecker model technique can be used to generate the 3D channel matrix with reduced complexity compared to the geometry-based technique.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Arrays","Array signal processing","Channel models","Azimuth","Antennas","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active antenna arrays","array signal processing","covariance matrices","Monte Carlo methods","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D channel model extensions","wireless systems","three-dimensional channel extension","two-dimensional channel models","2D channel models","azimuth angles","multipath components","receive-transmit pair","elevation angles","user equipment","UE location","active antenna system","AAS","aggregated array gain","Monte Carlo simulations","fixed vertical beamforming","adaptive vertical beamforming","line-of-sight","LoS","3D channel covariance matrix","feedback overhead","nonline-of-sight","NLoS","correlation-based Kronecker model technique","geometry-based technique","coupling loss"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666101","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666101.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D channel model extensions and characteristics study for future wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D channel model extensions and characteristics study for future wireless systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666101/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666101/","accessionNumber":"13901856","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D channel model extensions and characteristics study for future wireless systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p41jiang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047634S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6666103,"authors":[{"name":"Sohail Payami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sohail","lastName":"Payami","id":"38243699800"},{"name":"Fredrik Tufvesson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Tufvesson","id":"37296876300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666103","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":905},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Antenna measurements","Niobium","MIMO","Antennas","Wireless communication","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","delays","demodulation","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay spread property","measured massive MIMO system","massive multiple-input multiple-output system","base station","BS","mobile devices","wireless system intersymbol interference","channel delay dispersion","received signal demodulation process","linear precoders","ISI mitigation","massive MIMO channel","single antenna","independent identically distributed Gaussian channel","exponentially decaying average power delay profile","frequency 2.6 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["rms delay spread","large MIMO","massive MIMO","precoding","zero forcing","matched filter","MMSE"]}],"abstract":"Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where the base station (BS) is equipped with a large number of antennas and the mobile devices have a single antenna, can significantly enhance the system performance. In many wireless systems inter symbol interference (ISI) due to delay dispersion of the channel can dramatically affect the demodulation process of the received signals. Precoding in massive MIMO can reduce or eliminate ISI, while still exploiting the spatial diversity. In this paper, we investigate how much standard linear precoders help the ISI mitigation by shortening the rms delay spread. In order to evaluate the system performance, we measured a massive MIMO channel with 128 antennas at the base station and 36 users, including 26 line-of-sight and 10 non line-of-sight, each equipped with a single antenna. We also compare the results from the measurements with an independent identically distributed Gaussian channel with an exponentially decaying average power delay profile.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay spread properties in a measured massive MIMO system at 2.6 GHz","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666103","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666103.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Delay spread properties in a measured massive MIMO system at 2.6 GHz","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666103/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901975","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay spread properties in a measured massive MIMO system at 2.6 GHz","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p53payami.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043548S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666106,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaowu Zhan","affiliation":["INRIA INSA-Lyon, CITI-INRIA, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Zhaowu","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37085499850"},{"name":"Guillaume Villemaud","affiliation":["INRIA INSA-Lyon, CITI-INRIA, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Villemaud","id":"37294186600"},{"name":"Jean-Marie Gorce","affiliation":["INRIA INSA-Lyon, CITI-INRIA, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marie","lastName":"Gorce","id":"37264985500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666106","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"abstract":"Existing methods of self-interference cancellation have greatly reduced the strong self-interference signal for the practical design of Full-Duplex (FuDu) wireless systems.

In this paper, a wideband FuDu OFDM system with a single path self-interference channel is developed based on active analog self-interference cancellation (AASIC) at the RF component. Furthermore, a mathematical model of the wideband FuDu OFDM wireless system and the AASIC at the RF component are presented and elaborated. The performance of this FuDu system is evaluated by ADS-Matlab co-simulation based on the IEEE 802.11g system parameters. The comparison of the spectrum power of signals before and after the AASIC and the bite error rate (BER) performance of the FuDu OFDM wireless system show that the strong self-interference can be significantly reduced to almost noise level.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666106.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and evaluation of a wideband Full-Duplex OFDM system based on AASIC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Radio frequency","Wireless communication","Channel estimation","Noise","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband full-duplex OFDM system","AASIC","FuDu wireless systems","thermal noise","single path self-interference channel","active analog self-interference cancellation","RF component","mathematical model","ADS-Matlab cosimulation","IEEE 802.11 system parameters","spectrum power","bite error rate performance","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-Duplex","OFDM","Self-interference","Radio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of a wideband Full-Duplex OFDM system based on AASIC","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666106/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901759","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of a wideband Full-Duplex OFDM system based on AASIC","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p68zhan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041371S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666107,"authors":[{"name":"Hyeongsook Park","affiliation":["ETRI, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeongsook","lastName":"Park","id":"37290676700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666107","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Antenna measurements","OFDM","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","antenna arrays","block codes","cellular radio","diversity reception","electromagnetic wave polarisation","indoor radio","MIMO communication","space division multiplexing","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor field experiment results","spatial multiplexing MIMO system","dual-polarized antennas","multiple input multiple output system","IEEE 802.16m","unipolarized antennas","antenna element","orthogonal polarizations","multiple antenna system","polarization diversity","space frequency block codes","SFBC MIMO system","PER measurement","packet error rate","downlink signal","dual-polarized antenna system","multiplexing gain","worldwide interoperability-for-microwave access","4th generation cellular networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","polarization","IEEE 802.16m","SM","SFBC"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the performance of MIMO (multiple Input Multiple Output) system using dual-polarized antenna in a IEEE 802.16m.

The DL MU-MIMO system using the precoding matrix, which is generated through imperfect channel state information caused by channel estimation error and channel feedback quantization error, has severe performance degradation since each station (STA) receives the desired signal for the STA as well as the interference signal for different STAs. Therefore, the proposed detection algorithm is developed by considering both the desired signal and the interference signal. Using the characteristics of the interference signal, the proposed detection algorithm is performed by additionally detecting several interference symbols. The proposed algorithm has better performance than the conventional algorithm considering only the desired signal.

The article proposes a coordinated joint transmitter and receiver design to tackle the interference problem between two-way relaying channel in small cell and uplink channel in macro cell. We design the transceiver on the basis that the data streams from two-way communication nodes are aligned to the same direction to perform multi-stream decode-and-forward physical-layer network coding, while other streams are adjusted to orthogonal direction for spatial multiplexing. Coordinated beam-forming and joint multi-cell signal processing are both considered. Based on the criterion that minimizes system-wide mean square error, we formulate the transceiver optimization problem with transmit power constraints on each user and provide an approximate optimal solution for the non-convex problem through iterative algorithm. During the iteration, each of the transmitters and receivers is solved by Lagrange multiplier method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition. The scheme reduces interferences when all the nodes transmit multi-stream symbols simultaneously and significantly improves the system performance.

Both cellular and D2D communication take place in the same spectrum. D2D communication is based on PNC, and a joint transceiver design is required to facilitate PNC mapping with MIMO channels. A joint precoder-decoder scheme is also considered in the cellular communication to mitigate interference, and improve the error performance. Mean square errors at nodes are considered as the objective function, and interference threshold limits and power constraints are also used in joint precoder-decoder design problems. These turn out to be non-convex optimization problems, and we propose two algorithms in both phases of D2D and cellular communication. Distributed optimization methods are used in the proposed algorithms. We analyze the convergence of proposed algorithms, and the system performances are investigated with different D2D pair locations, interference constraint thresholds, and maximum available power at nodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666110.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"94","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO physical layer network coding based underlay device-to-device communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Optimization","Covariance matrices","Frequency modulation","Joints","Interference","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","concave programming","decoding","interference suppression","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","network coding","precoding","radio transceivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO physical layer network coding","underlay device-to-device communication","multiple-input multiple-output two-way relaying","underlay D2D communication system","cellular communication","joint transceiver design","PNC mapping","MIMO channels","interference mitigation","error performance","mean square errors","joint precoder-decoder design problem","nonconvex optimization problem","distributed optimization method","D2D pair location","interference constraint threshold"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"MIMO physical layer network coding based underlay device-to-device communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666110/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902108","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO physical layer network coding based underlay device-to-device communication","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p89laddu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092038S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666114,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Takizawa","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Takizawa","id":"37264999600"},{"name":"Mikio Suzuki","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Mikio","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37274838000"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Tsuji","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Tsuji","id":"37302194700"},{"name":"Ryu Miura","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryu","lastName":"Miura","id":"37267299500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666114","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Sea measurements","Delays","Urban areas","Radio propagation","Trajectory","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","autonomous aerial vehicles","radio links","radio networks","radiowave propagation","transient response","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","path diversity","radio links","unmanned aerial vehicles","wireless network","unmanned aircrafts","UAs","temporal communications","disrupted terrestrial networks","radio channels","radio propagation","path loss","RMS delay","radio signal polarization","channel impulse responses","IEEE802.11g","propagation simulations"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a performance evaluation on path diversity introduced in a wireless network established by unmanned aerial vehicles or unmanned aircrafts (UAs). One of usage scenarios of the wireless network established by UAs is establishment of a temporal communications instead of disrupted terrestrial networks due to a massive disaster. In order to evaluate system performance based on this usage scenario, we have conducted the following simulations; first, radio propagation characteristics between UAs flying over different two conditions have been simulated, after that, system simulations have been carried out over radio channels derived by simulations. Results regarding radio propagation reveal that characteristics including path loss and RMS delay are highly depend on not only altitude of the deployed UAs, but also its polarization of radio signal.

From the reference model, the space-time-frequency correlation function among the links of the underlying MIMO communication channels is derived, under realistic 3-D non-isotropic scattering conditions. The numerical results depict that the correlation is significantly affected by the multipath elevation angles. These results also demonstrate that the time and frequency dispersion of a wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering relay-based channel are not statistically independent. The proposed channel model provides an important framework and guidelines for the system design and performance analysis of multi-antenna M-to-M communication systems in relay-based wideband channels

The relay is assumed to operate in the decode-and-forward mode. The average symbol error rate (SER) performance for binary phase shift keying (BPSK) is analyzed. To make the analysis mathematically tractable, two approximations are adopted to deal with the problem of correlations between the received SINRs of the relay and terminal and a tight approximate expression of the average SER is derived in closed-form. Moreover, it can be shown that the result can be simply applied in straightforward network coding protocol with co-channel interference. Based on the analytic results, we study the impacts of system parameters, such as interference power, number of interferers and relay placement, on the average SER performance. Finally, the correctness of our analytic results is validated through Monte Carlo simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666119/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916100","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Symbol error rate of two-way decode-and-forward relaying with co-channel interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol error rate of two-way decode-and-forward relaying with co-channel interference","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p138xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056181S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6666122,"authors":[{"name":"Yunlu Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunlu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085589122"},{"name":"Yafei Tian","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Tian","id":"37532365900"},{"name":"Chenyang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chenyang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279099600"},{"name":"Chengjun Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Samsung Telecom R&D Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengjun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37675267800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666122","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666122","abstract":"With the increasing number of mobile terminals, the capacity of cellular network can hardly satisfy the user requirement in the future.

of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems gives an estimate of symbol starting time index corresponding to the path with maximal power within an interval suggested by coarse timing stage. The actual starting index fed to the following stages is brought forward by an amount that should be adaptive to the estimated index to optimize system performance. In this paper, a method of detecting the estimated starting time index of path with maximal power in channel impulse response is proposed based on conventional preamble with repetitive structure. To deal with the adverse effect of fractional timing offset on the detection metric, we propose a preamble composed of cyclic-shifted parts and the accompanying fine timing and detection scheme. Simulation with time-varying wireless channel shows the detection methods makes use of the time diversity provided by time-varying paths and has good error performance. The scheme with proposed preamble further reduces probability of error detection with the diversity in fractional timing offset provided inherently in the parts of preamble.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666129","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666129.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"192","endPage":"196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximal power path detection for OFDM timing-advanced synchronization schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximal power path detection for OFDM timing-advanced synchronization schemes","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666129/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902298","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666129/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximal power path detection for OFDM timing-advanced synchronization schemes","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p192chan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052481S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666132,"authors":[{"name":"Lucas Dias H.

This paper presents a game theoretic approach for EE maximization in MC-CDMA wireless cooperative networks considering receiver single-user or multi-user design, as well as distributed implementation approach in order to solve the EE design problem. Moreover, the iterative water-filling algorithm (IWFA) and the Verhulst distributed power control algorithm (V-DPCA) are employed to solve the inner loop of the proposed EE maximization algorithm. A study over the quasi-concavity of the utility function is presented while numerical results are offered to corroborate the mathematical model, as well as to verify the better performance of the IWFA over the V-DPCA. Indeed, the superiority of the IWFA over V-DPCA in terms of both EE and SE is evident. This may be explained through the fact that the IWFA optimizes the power allocation of each user through all sub-carriers at the same time, while Verhulst-based DPCA performs the power control on each sub-channel considering all users.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666132","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666132.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency design in MC-CDMA cooperative networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency design in MC-CDMA cooperative networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666132/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902033","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666132/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency design in MC-CDMA cooperative networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p207sampaio.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058716S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666134,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Monsees","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Monsees","id":"38238440800"},{"name":"Carsten Bockelmann","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Bockelmann","id":"37568999500"},{"name":"Armin Dekorsy","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dekorsy","id":"37284963100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666134","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Error analysis","Vectors","Estimation","Joints","Decoding","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data communication","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing Bayes-risk detection","frame based multiuser systems","data detection","signaling overhead","multiuser machine-to-machine communication systems","multiuser uplink scenarios","data detector","symbol-by-symbol maximum a posteriori detection"]}],"abstract":"Performing joint activity and data detection has recently gained attention for reducing signaling overhead in multi-user Machine-to-Machine Communication systems.

The employment of the high data rate applications with troposcatter communications requires the investigation of the troposcatter channels. However, available channel models for the troposcatter communications are not able to take the non-homogeneities of the air turbulence into account. Therefore, the main motivation of this paper is to develop a ray-based MIMO troposcatter channel model in which the beamwidths of the antennas are divided to small parts and, the associated delay and power of the rays are calculated in order to consider the non-homogeneities and time variations of the channel. Also, in order to show the time varying behaviour of the channel this paper provides the simulation results for the maximum data rate of the channel by using real world measurements first time in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666139","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666139.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A ray-based channel model for MIMO troposcatter communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666139/","displayDocTitle":"A ray-based channel model for MIMO troposcatter communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916080","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666139/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ray-based channel model for MIMO troposcatter communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p243dinc.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072902S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666140,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Hoon Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engin eering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Hoon","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086627501"},{"name":"Joonghee Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engin eering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Joonghee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37081731100"},{"name":"Seong-Cheol Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engin eering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Cheol","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291921400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666140","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Shadow mapping","Receivers","Anechoic chambers","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anechoic chambers (electromagnetic)","indoor radio","radiowave propagation","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-building measurement","multipath channel profile","propagation path","power loss","diffraction theory","anechoic chamber measurement","deterministic shadowing model","received signal predictions","mobile devices","ray-tracing technique","indoor environment","user-body shadowing model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ray-tracing technique","user-body shadowing","uniform theory of diffraction"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a ray-tracing technique taking into consideration the effects of user-body shadowing is investigated.

Starting from the geometrical scattering model, a reference channel model is derived under the assumption of single-bounce scattering in line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) propagation environments. In the proposed channel model, it is assumed that an infinite number of scatterers are uniformly distributed on the tunnel wall. Starting from the geometrical scattering model, the time-variant transfer function (TVTF) is derived and its correlation properties are studied. Expressions are presented for the two-dimensional (2D) time-frequency correlation function (TFCF), the temporal autocorrelation function (ACF), and the frequency correlation function (FCF). Owing to the semicircular geometry, we reduced the originally threefold integrals to double integrals in computations of the correlation functions, which are easy to solve numerically. From the TVTF characterizing the reference model, an efficient sum-of-cisoids (SOC) channel simulator is derived. Numerical results show that both the temporal ACF and the FCF of the SOC channel simulator match very well with those of the reference model.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666141","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666141.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband car-to-car channel model based on a geometrical semicircular tunnel scattering model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666141/","displayDocTitle":"A wideband car-to-car channel model based on a geometrical semicircular tunnel scattering model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902123","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666141/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wideband car-to-car channel model based on a geometrical semicircular tunnel scattering model","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p253avazov.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087097S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666145,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuel Staudinger","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Emanuel","lastName":"Staudinger","id":"37705969900"},{"name":"Armin Dammann","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dammann","id":"37269758600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666145","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","OFDM","Noise","Delays","Reactive power","Bandwidth","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser round-trip delay ranging scheme","sparsely allocated OFDM signals","figure of merit","position estimation technique","cooperative positioning","mobile nodes","subcarrier-interleaved round-trip delay ranging scheme","amplify-forward relaying","linear complexity","Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower-bounds","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","3GPP-LTE system parameters","time slots"]}],"abstract":"Ranging performance is a fundamental and crucial figure of merit for any position estimation technique. Cooperative positioning requires accurate range estimation with low latency. Common solutions employ time slots to sequentially range among all possible mobile nodes. In this case the number of ranging links increases quadratically with the number of users which increases latency significantly. We propose a subcarrier-interleaved round-trip delay ranging scheme with amplify and forward relaying to overcome this drawback. We show that we can reach linear complexity and significantly reduce latency. The obtained low latency allows higher flexibility and higher scalability compared to existing solutions. Furthermore, we study theoretical performances with derived Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower-bounds for signals with orthogonal frequency division multiplex. Simulation results with 3GPP-LTE system parameters and our proposed sparse allocation show that our approach is well suited for low-latency and highly accurate range estimation.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666145","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666145.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"2780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user round-trip delay ranging scheme with sparsely allocated OFDM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666145/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user round-trip delay ranging scheme with sparsely allocated OFDM signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901826","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666145/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user round-trip delay ranging scheme with sparsely allocated OFDM signals","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p275staudinger.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044902S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666149,"authors":[{"name":"Guan Gui","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Guan","lastName":"Gui","id":"37590883700"},{"name":"Abolfazl Mehbodniya","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Mehbodniya","id":"37419363800"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666149","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximations","Channel estimation","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Standards","Cost function","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","broadband networks","channel estimation","fading channels","least mean squares methods","Monte Carlo methods","radio receivers","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regularization parameter selection","Monte Carlo method","cost function","l1 norm sparse constraint","RZA-LMS/F algorithm","zero attracting LMS/F algorithm","broadband channel","random training signal scaling","ASCE method","least mean square-fourth algorithm","adaptive sparse channel estimation","broadband signal transmission","frequency selective fading channel","channel state information","receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["least mean square fourth (LMS/F)","adaptive sparse channel estimation (ASCE)","zero-attracting least mean square/fourth (ZA-LMS/F)","re-weighted zero-attracting least mean square/fourth (RZA-LMS/F)"]}],"abstract":"Broadband signal transmission over frequency-selective fading channel often requires accurate channel state information at receiver. One of the most attracting adaptive channel estimation (ACE) methods is least mean square (LMS) algorithm. However, its performance is often degraded by random scaling of input training signal. To overcome this degradation, in this paper we consider the use of standard least mean square/fourth (LMS/F) algorithm. Since the broadband channel is often described by sparse channel model, such sparsity could be exploited as prior information. First, we propose an adaptive sparse channel estimation (ASCE) method with zero-attracting LMS/F (ZA-LMS/F) algorithm by introducing an \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm sparse constraint into the cost function. Then, to exploit the sparsity more effectively, an improved ASCE with reweighted zero-attracting LMS/F (RZA-LMS/F) algorithm is proposed. For different channel sparsity, we propose a Monte Carlo method for a regularization parameter selection in RA-LMS/F and RZA-LMS/F to achieve better steady-state estimation performance. Simulation results show that the proposed ASCE methods achieve better estimation performance than the conventional one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least mean square/fourth algorithm for adaptive sparse channel estimation","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666149","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666149.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Least mean square/fourth algorithm for adaptive sparse channel estimation","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666149/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902113","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least mean square/fourth algorithm for adaptive sparse channel estimation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p296gui.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058049S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666151,"authors":[{"name":"Xiping Wu","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications Joint Research Institute for Signal and Image Processing School of Engineering The University of Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Xiping","lastName":"Wu","id":"38490662900"},{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Laboratory for Signals and Systems (LSS), \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 (SUPELEC), Gif-sur-Yvette, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications Joint Research Institute for Signal and Image Processing School of Engineering The University of Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666151","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":410},"abstract":"In single-stream multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) schemes, such as spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK), a single transmit antenna is activated at any given time. Therefore, unlike multi-stream MIMO transmitters, simultaneous pilot transmissions are prohibitive because of a single radio-frequency (RF) chain. In state-of-the-art literature, the channels of different transmit antennas are individually estimated. As a result, more time is required to transfer pilots and the effective data rate is compromised. In this paper, we propose a novel channel estimation (CE) technique for single-stream MIMO systems. Given a pilot ratio, the proposed scheme achieves the same estimation period as multi-stream MIMO systems without needing any additional information or feedback. Simulations are implemented under a practical base station environment. Results show that for various speeds of the mobile user, the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of SM in comparison to the conventional CE method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666151.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"310","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation for spatial modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Estimation","Modulation","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial modulation","single-stream multiple-input multiple-output scheme","SM","space shift keying","SSK","single transmit antenna","multistream MIMO transmitter","single radiofrequency chain","single RF chain","channel estimation technique","CE technique","single-stream MIMO system","multistream MIMO system","base station environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","single-stream","spatial modulation (SM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation for spatial modulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666151/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901777","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation for spatial modulation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p306wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072445S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666153,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086767568"},{"name":"Xiaodan He","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodan","lastName":"He","id":"37086718744"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666153","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Three-dimensional displays","Time-frequency analysis","Interpolation","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","planar antenna arrays","transmitting antennas","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot aided channel estimation","3D MIMO-OFDM systems","planar transmit antennas","elevation effect","three-dimensional channel","3D multiinput multiout technique","3D channel","pilot spacing constraints","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiple antennas","channel correlation","cascaded low-dimensional Wiener filters","mean square error","MSE","diamond-shaped 4D pilot pattern","4D channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) channel with elevation effect and planar antennas employed at the base station are two factors to be considered when researching 3D multi-input multi-out (MIMO) technique.

Using T-RBP, significant improvement can be achieved in both convergence speed and convergence error-rate performance. In addition to T-RBP, the simplified-RBP (S-RBP) decoder is also proposed in order to reduce the complexity. Instead of comparing all the residuals of all edges in the code graph, as with previous IDS decoders, S-RBP only compares the residuals of the edges connected to a single check node, thus dramatically reduces the complexity without any significant degradation in performance. The proposed T-RBP and S-RBP can improve not only the performance of dedicated codes, but also that of punctured codes, especially the convergence speed. The improvement can make punctured LDPC codes more practical and becoming a competitive candidate for the rate compatible applications.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666154","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666154.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Informed dynamic schedules for LDPC decoding using belief propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666154/","displayDocTitle":"Informed dynamic schedules for LDPC decoding using belief propagation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902118","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666154/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Informed dynamic schedules for LDPC decoding using belief propagation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p321lee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052784S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666156,"authors":[{"name":"Hosein Nikopour","affiliation":["Ottawa Wireless R&D Centre, Huawei Technologies Canada Co.

Effectively, a QAM symbol is repeated over multiple tones. Low density signature (LDS) is a version of CDMA with low density spreading sequence allowing us to take advantage of a near optimal ML receiver with practically feasible complexity. In this paper, we propose a new multiple access scheme so called sparse code multiple access (SCMA) which still enjoys the low complexity reception technique but with better performance compared to LDS. In SCMA, the procedure of bit to QAM symbol mapping and spreading are combined together and incoming bits are directly mapped to a multidimensional codeword of an SCMA codebook set. Each layer or user has its dedicated codebook. Shaping gain of a multidimensional constellation is the main source of the performance improvement in comparison to the simple repetition of QAM symbols in LDS. In general, SCMA codebook design is an optimization problem.

The influence of each impairment is characterized by the interference analysis of the demodulated signal that reveals interesting insight into the distortion origination. Then, we analytically investigate the performance loss as a function of IQI, CFO and channel distortions in a realistic receiver with channel estimation error.

The proposed method integrates three interference control methods - power control, timing synchronization, and resource partitioning - by leveraging measurement results in various environments. The interferences on physical downlink data channel (PDSCH) and physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) are separated by using the timing synchronization between macrocells and femtocells, and these two interferences are handled independently. The interference on PDCCH is controlled by the transmission power control and that on PDSCH is controlled by the frequency resource partitioning. Moreover, it can deal with both inter-tier and intra-tier interference on the PDSCH and PDCCH. Computer simulations in accordance with 3GPP specifications are conducted in order to evaluate the effect of the proposed method compared with an existing transmission power control method. The results of the simulations show that the proposed method reduced PDCCH outage probability for both macro users and femto users. They also show that the proposed method can reduce downlink femtocell interference for macro users (victim UEs) without reducing femtocell throughput.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666167","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications

By exploiting cooperative capability at primary base station (PBS) and secondary base station (SBS), spatial signal processing procedure is designed. With the scheme, interference alignment (IA) is firstly employed to adjust multiple cognitive transmissions to lie in the subspace orthogonal to the one spanned by the primary signal. Then primary information is recovered at PBS without interference and fed to SBS via inter-BS collaboration. Finally, SBS subtracts the primary part from the received mixed signal and extracts the secondary information separately. With regard to SU scheduling transmission difference of various channel realizations is exploited to achieve multiuser diversity gain. According to the IAC based mechanism the priority of primary is guaranteed, and interference-free coexistence of both primary and secondary transmission is achieved. Moreover, effective utilization of spatial channel resource is realized compared with traditional IA based scheme. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the achievable data rate of secondary transmission is significantly enhanced.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666169","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666169.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coexistent transmission and user scheduling for CR-MIMO system based on interference alignment and cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666169/","displayDocTitle":"Coexistent transmission and user scheduling for CR-MIMO system based on interference alignment and cancellation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902020","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666169/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coexistent transmission and user scheduling for CR-MIMO system based on interference alignment and cancellation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p403shen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064348S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666170,"authors":[{"name":"Jihoon Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Sogang University, Seoul, KOREA"],"firstName":"Jihoon","lastName":"Sung","id":"37086777076"},{"name":"Wonjin Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Sogang University, Seoul, KOREA"],"firstName":"Wonjin","lastName":"Sung","id":"37334929600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666170","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":611},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose channel training and beamforming schemes to maximize the benefit of large-scale antenna, or massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed schemes are operated by transmitting continuous precoding matrix indicator (PMI) feedback signals through a series of pattern. Conventional communication systems, such as LTE systems, use PMI, rank indicator (RI), and channel quality indicator (CQI) to report the channel state information (CSI) to the enhanced node B (eNB), with an increasing feedback overhead as the number of antenna elements increases. The proposed beamforming and feedback schemes solve this problem by iterative CSI reports and codebook extension. Each PMI report is conducted based on a component codebook of smaller size, and cumulated feedback information is utilized to build an extended beamformer. The proposed methods are applicable to many different types of wireless systems, including frequency division duplex (FDD) systems which do not possess the channel reciprocity assumed by many of earlier works. The methods also ensure the backward compatibility which allows the operation of legacy user equipment (UE). The continuous feedback process also enables the enhancement of the codebook resolution. The resulting system performance improvement is verified by computer simulation results.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Array signal processing","Transmitting

Faceted array antennas are chosen because they can achieve a wider scanning range compared to planar arrays. Each of the faceted arrays consists of eight circularly polarised antennas operating at 2.4 GHz. Beamforming is achieved according to two different optimisation criteria, which are the minimised mean square error (MMSE) and the maximised signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR). The adaptive algorithm, Least Mean Square (LMS), and the bio-inspired algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), are used to calculate the complex excitations of the array elements in order to satisfy the optimisation criteria. The directivity of the 3-faceted array is high, 12.59 dBi, even when the desired signal is away from boresight. The results obtained suggest that the 3-faceted array is the most suitable for adaptive array applications compared to the other faceted structures.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"425","endPage":"429","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666173.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faceted array antennas for adaptive beamforming applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666173/","displayDocTitle":"Faceted array antennas for adaptive beamforming applications","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902155","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faceted array antennas for adaptive beamforming applications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p425noordin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08778S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666175,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Wei Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085431055"},{"name":"Hen-Wai Tsao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hen-Wai","lastName":"Tsao","id":"37277278800"},{"name":"Pei-Yun Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Yun","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37530250500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666175","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Matrix decomposition","Sorting","Bit error rate","Receivers","Equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","matrix decomposition","MIMO communication","precoding","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equal-rate QR decomposition","MMSE technique","multiuser MIMO precoding technique","multiple-input multiple-output wireless communications","multiuser MIMO communications","augmented channel matrix","minimum mean squared error approach","Tomlinson-Harashima precoding","equal-rate power allocation","equal-rate QR-MMSE-THP precoder","zero-forcing channel matrix","equal-rate QR-ZF-THP precoder","ZF channel matrix","sorting strategy","block diagonalized decompositions","block diagonalized-geometric mean decomposition","BD-GMD-MMSE schemes","per-layer sorting algorithm","PLS","per-user sorting algorithm","PUS","full sorting algorithm","FS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple-user","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) precoding","QR","MMSE","Tomlinson-Harashima precoding(THP)"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, the research on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications has attracted much interest. This study investigates precoding techniques for multi-user MIMO communications. By applying QR decomposition to augmented channel matrix based on minimum mean squared error (MMSE) approach plus Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) and equal-rate power allocation, we show that the proposed equal-rate QR-MMSE-THP precoder has better performance than the one based on zero-forcing (ZF) channel matrix, called equal-rate QR-ZF-THP precoder, and the conventional MMSE precoder. In addition, sorting strategies can be adopted to enhance performance with more freedom for QR decomposition compared to block diagonalized decompositions such as block diagonalized-geometric mean decomposition (BD-GMD) and BD-GMD-MMSE schemes while complexity can still be kept practical. Also, the sorting strategies such as full sorting (FS), per-layer sorting (PLS) and per-user sorting (PUS) are discussed and compared in this paper. Simulation results show that for large MIMO systems, the proposed equal-rate QR-MMSE-THP with PLS strategy outperforms the equal-rate BD-GMD-MMSE-THP precoder with PUS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equal-rate QR decomposition based on MMSE technique for multi-user MIMO precoding","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666175","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666175.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Equal-rate QR decomposition based on MMSE technique for multi-user MIMO precoding","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666175/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902022","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equal-rate QR decomposition based on MMSE technique for multi-user MIMO precoding","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p435chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05274S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666179,"authors":[{"name":"Nuwan S.

This new scheme achieves higher secrecy performance by exploiting eavesdropper's channel state information. The key idea behind our proposal is to perform the antenna selection aiming to maximize the overall secrecy rate instead of maximizing the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio of the main channel. In our analysis, we assume that the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper employ a maximal-ratio combining technique to combine the received signals from the transmitter. Considering Nakagami-m fading channels, a closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability is derived, which can be used as a quality of service metric. Further, an asymptotic analysis is carried out and the diversity/array gains are obtained. The ergodic secrecy rate is also investigated for the case of multiple input single output wiretap channels. Representative numerical examples are plotted and validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Insightful discussions are drawn from the proposed analysis.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666179","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666179.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"465","endPage":"460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing the secrecy performance in MIMO wiretap channels: A novel transmit antenna selection scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing the secrecy performance in MIMO wiretap channels: A novel transmit antenna selection scheme","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666179/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901899","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666179/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing the secrecy performance in MIMO wiretap channels: A novel transmit antenna selection scheme","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p456ferdinand.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108238S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6666182,"authors":[{"name":"AlaaEddin Loulou","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"AlaaEddin","lastName":"Loulou","id":"37077437900"},{"name":"Markku Renfors","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Renfors","id":"37279773600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666182","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Computational complexity","Optimization","Frequency-domain analysis","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cognitive radio","computational complexity","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM sidelobe control","fragmented spectrum use","multicarrier scheme","adaptive functionality","waveform processing","cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum use","fragmented coexistence scenarios","sidelobes","subcarriers","adjacent frequency slots","edge windowing","cancellation carrier","spectrum leakage","3GPP LTE","OFDM signal leakage","low-complexity algorithms","spectral efficiency","power efficiency","cancellation carrier scheme","noncontiguous subcarrier allocation","sidelobe suppression","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"OFDM as multicarrier scheme provides adaptive functionality that is required to implement waveform processing for cognitive radio, dynamic spectrum use and fragmented coexistence scenarios. However, OFDM faces some difficulties due to the relatively strong sidelobes around the active subcarriers, which introduces interference effects between adjacent frequency slots intended to be used independently in non-synchronized way. In this paper we consider edge windowing and cancellation carrier approaches for controlling the spectrum leakage in a practicadl 5 MHz 3GPP LTE scenario. The focus is on minimizing the OFDM signal leakage to narrow unused gaps in the used frequency band, using low-complexity algorithms and minimized overheads in terms of power and spectral efficiency. We develop a simplified version of the cancellation carrier scheme which is suitable for non-contiguous subcarrier allocation in OFDM. It is shown that with relatively narrow unused gaps in the spectrum, it is possible to reach good level of sidelobe suppression with significantly reduced computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666182","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666182.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective schemes for OFDM sidelobe control in fragmented spectrum use","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666182/","displayDocTitle":"Effective schemes for OFDM sidelobe control in fragmented spectrum use","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901799","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666182/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective schemes for OFDM sidelobe control in fragmented spectrum use","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p471renfors.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071706S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666185,"authors":[{"name":"Yichen Li","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Yichen","lastName":"Li","id":"37086742609"},{"name":"Dobroslav Tsonev","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Dobroslav","lastName":"Tsonev","id":"38234626700"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666185","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1058},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation approach is presented. This method uses the Optical Spatial Modulation (OSM) technique to obtain positive and real-valued signals which are required by an Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) system. In comparison to existing OFDM methods applied to the OSM system, the new scheme, Non-DC-biased OFDM (NDC-OFDM), has significant advantages. Compared to DC-biased Optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM), NDC-OFDM avoids DC-biasing and, thus, improves the power efficiency. Moreover, the spectral and power efficiency of the new approach are better than the well-known unipolar optical modulation scheme, Asymmetrically Clipped Optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM). The bit-error ratio (BER) performances of these three methods are compared. Compared to ACO-OFDM and DCO-OFDM, NDC-OFDM has an energy saving gain of at least 5 dB for the same spectral efficiency. The improvement comes at the expense of additional hardware at the transmitter and receiver. However, visible light communication (VLC) systems typically are equipped with multiple low-cost Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) to fulfill minimum indoor lighting conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666185.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"490","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-DC-biased OFDM with Optical Spatial Modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical transmitters","Optical modulation","Optical receivers","Light emitting diodes","Optical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","light emitting diodes","OFDM modulation","optical communication","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonDC-biased OFDM","optical spatial modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation approach","NDC-OFDM modulation approach","positive signals","real-valued signals","optical wireless communication system","OWC system","DC-biased optical OFDM","DCO-OFDM","asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM","ACO-OFDM","bit-error ratio performances","BER performances","visible light communication systems","VLC systems","low-cost LED","low-cost light emitting diodes","indoor lighting conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical spatial modulation","optical OFDM","optical wireless communication","MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Non-DC-biased OFDM with Optical Spatial Modulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666185/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902265","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-DC-biased OFDM with Optical Spatial Modulation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p486li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067879S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666187,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Posp\u00ed\u0161il","affiliation":["Department of Radio electronics, Brno University of Technology, BRNO, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Posp\u00ed\u0161il","id":"37085530689"},{"name":"Roman Marsalek","affiliation":["Department of Radio electronics, Brno University of Technology, BRNO, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Marsalek","id":"37294391500"},{"name":"Jitka Pomenkova","affiliation":["Department of Radio electronics, Brno University of Technology, BRNO, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jitka","lastName":"Pomenkova","id":"37085408772"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666187","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"abstract":"This paper is oriented in the area of wireless device identification through the analysis of emitted signals corrupted by radio frequency transmitter impairments.

Energy harvesting and harvesting aware medium access control protocols have the potential to provide uninterrupted network operation, as they aim to replenish the lost energy so that energy neutral operation of the energy harvesting nodes can be achieved. To further improve the energy harvesting process, there is a need for novel schemes so that maximum energy is harvested in a minimum possible time. Multi-hop radio frequency (RF) energy transfer is one such solution that addresses these needs. With the optimal placement of energy relay nodes, multi-hop RF energy transfer can save energy of the source as well as time for the harvesting process. In this work we experimentally demonstrate multi-hop RF energy transfer, wherein two-hop energy transfer is shown to achieve significant energy and time savings with respect to the single-hop case. It is also shown that the gain obtained can be translated to energy transfer range extension.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666195","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666195.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental demonstration of multi-hop RF energy transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666195/","displayDocTitle":"Experimental demonstration of multi-hop RF energy transfer","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902168","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666195/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental demonstration of multi-hop RF energy transfer","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p538kaushik.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077502S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666197,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Afana","affiliation":["ECE Department, Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Afana","id":"38469714700"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["ECE Department, Texas A&M Universitv, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"},{"name":"Vahid Asghari","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Qu\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Asghari","id":"37542196600"},{"name":"Sofi\u00e9ne Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Qu\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofi\u00e9ne","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666197","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Array signal processing","Transceivers","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cochannel interference","decode and forward communication","error statistics","radio transceivers","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative beamforming","spectrum-sharing two-way selective relay networks","cochannel interferences","cognitive system","spectrum efficiency enhancement","secondary transceivers","secondary decode-and-forward relays","DF relays","multiple primary transceivers","cooperative beamforming process","primary receivers","CCI","closed-form expressions","outage probability","bit error rate","BER","independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels","interference mitigation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider collaborative beamforming for spectrum-sharing two-way relay networks in an effort to improve the performance of the cognitive system and enhance the spectrum efficiency. In such a joint relaying/spectrum-sharing setting, a pair of secondary transceivers communicates via a set of secondary decode-and-forward (DF) relays in the presence of multiple primary transceivers. Among the available relays, only those that receive the signals reliably participate in the cooperative beamforming process to nullify the interference inflicted on primary receivers. Furthermore, the received signals at relays and at secondary transceivers are unavoidably interfered by the signals from primary transmitters. To study the performance of the cognitive system under the effects of these co-channel interferences (CCIs) from the primary transmitters, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability and bit error rate (BER) over independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels.

In this paper, we explore the use of beamspace methods for creating virtual antenna ports in the vertical direction to enable a base station antenna array to exploit the elevation dimension of the multipath channel. We consider two ways of configuring the vertical antenna array: vertical sectorization, which creates additional sectors in the vertical domain, and vertical beamforming, which simply leverages the additional vertical antenna ports with existing MIMO processing techniques. For Rel-8/10 LTE, we show that both vertical sectorization and vertical beamforming can provide significant gains in the average and cell-edge throughputs, both in full buffer traffic as well as bursty traffic.

The goal is to identify the jointly optimal transmission (power allocation) policy which maximizes the total data throughput until a given deadline. To that aim, we propose a semi-analytical procedure on which basis the optimal policy for each sensor can be computed as a concatenation of a number of battery operated like transmission policies. The computational complexity of such semi-analytical methods turns out to be much lower than that of other numerical optimization tools (e.g., interior point algorithm).

The novelty brought by our setup is three-fold: First we consider a more realistic rate target constraint at the primary receiver instead of the less meaningful maximum interference temperature, second we propose a limited channel state information (CSI) structure whereby transmitters only have access to partly instantaneous feedback (i.e., about the direct channels) and partly statistical feedback (i.e., about the interference channels). Third, we formulate a distributed decision making scenario, by which channel information is not shared among primary and secondary transmitters. Instead, a transmitter must make a precoding decision based on local CSI only. The problem is recast as a team decision theoretic problem and the optimal precoders are obtained by solving semidefinite programs (SDPs). A distributed algorithm is derived and compared with classical precoding solutions and gains are illustrated over a range of scenarios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"575","endPage":"579","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666202.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A team decisional beamforming approach for underlay cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666202/","displayDocTitle":"A team decisional beamforming approach for underlay cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901893","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A team decisional beamforming approach for underlay cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p575filippou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06147S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666204,"authors":[{"name":"Warit Prawatmuang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Warit","lastName":"Prawatmuang","id":"38262243100"},{"name":"Daniel K.

When the licensed user is not using the spectrum, CR will then use it to communicate among each other. Hence, spectrum sensing, a procedure to observe primary user's existence, is important to CR. In this paper, we investigate the energy detection based cooperative spectrum sensing technique as it offers low complexity and significantly improves the sensing performance for CR. Conventional soft decision combining (SDC) scheme assumes that CR's local observation is perfectly forwarded to the fusion center. This forwarding procedure requires bandwidth, and increasingly so with more sensing nodes. By carefully applying quantization to this local observation, we could significantly reduce the number of bits required for this communication and thus reduce the overall system overhead. Uniform and non-uniform quantization approaches for SDC are investigated. We further propose a low complexity scheme based on an approximation of the cumulative density function. Simulation results show that these schemes can achieve a good detection performance comparable to the conventional SDC scheme, with reduced communication overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666204/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13902071","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666204/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Quantized cooperative spectrum sensing for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized cooperative spectrum sensing for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p585prawatmuang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051534S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666205,"authors":[{"name":"Jeroen Van Hecke","affiliation":["Universiteit Gent, Gent, BE"],"firstName":"Jeroen","lastName":"Van Hecke"},{"name":"Filippo Giannetti","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Pisa, Pisa, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Giannetti"},{"name":"Vincenzo Lottici","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Pisa, Pisa, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Lottici"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["Universiteit Gent, Gent, BE"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666205","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Tin","Erbium","Interference constraints","Receivers","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel allocation","cognitive radio","cooperative communication","fading channels","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","minimisation","probability","protocols","radio receivers","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["link outage probability minimization","cooperative cognitive radio network","relay selection","interference power constraint","secondary user","primary user","PU receiver","amplify and forward protocol","suboptimum dynamic energy allocation strategy","source node","destination node","interference channel","fading channel","root mean square value","static allocation strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Cooperative Communications","Convex Optimization","Relay selection","Amplify-and-forward"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution, a cognitive radio scenario is considered, where a secondary user (SU) cooperative network is allowed to transmit concurrently with a primary user (PU), provided that the resulting average interference power at the PU receiver is kept below a certain threshold. The SU network uses a selection amplify-and-forward protocol. An optimum and a low-complexity suboptimum dynamic energy allocation strategy are proposed, that minimize the link outage probability between the source node and the destination node of the SU network under an average interference power constraint. Because the interference channels from the SU nodes to the PU are affected by fast fading, the realistic assumption is made that each SU node has access to the root mean-square value (rather than the instantaneous value) of the gain of its own interference channel to the PU. We show that both dynamic allocation strategies considerably outperform the optimum static allocation strategy, and that the low-complexity dynamic allocation performs nearly as well as the optimum dynamic allocation. Finally, we confirm that our dynamic algorithms show a significant performance improvement as compared to the optimal dynamic algorithm under a peak interference power constraint.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666205","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666205.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666205","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"590","endPage":"595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage probability minimization for cooperative cognitive radio with best-relay selection under an average interference power constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Outage probability minimization for cooperative cognitive radio with best-relay selection under an average interference power constraint","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666205/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666205/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901999","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage probability minimization for cooperative cognitive radio with best-relay selection under an average interference power constraint","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p590vanhecke.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.206652S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666206,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Schirmer","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Digital Broadcasting Research Laboratory, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Schirmer","id":"38503131300"},{"name":"Mohamed Alzarouk Alsharef","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Digital Broadcasting Research Laboratory, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamed Alzarouk","lastName":"Alsharef","id":"37074711500"},{"name":"Wim Kotterman","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Digital Broadcasting Research Laboratory, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Wim","lastName":"Kotterman","id":"37331025600"},{"name":"Alexander Ihlow","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Digital Broadcasting Research Laboratory, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Ihlow","id":"37391596500"},{"name":"Giovanni Del Galdo","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Digital Broadcasting Research Laboratory, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Del Galdo","id":"37427000100"},{"name":"Albert Heuberger","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Heuberger","id":"37294233800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666206","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Load modeling","Cognitive radio","GSM","Testing","Markov processes","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cognitive radio","radio links","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio device","Ilmenau University of Technology campus","GSM 900 downlink band","statistical parameter","time-resolution model","interference","dynamic spectrum access","mobile communication","radio spectrum scarcity","ubiquitous problem","high time-resolution spectrum occupancy model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectrum modeling","high time-resolution","Markov models","parameter adaptation"]}],"abstract":"The ubiquitous problem of radio spectrum scarcity caused by ever-increasing traffic, e.g. in mobile communications, demands measures. One approach would be secondary use of spectrum by radio devices with cognitive abilities employing dynamic spectrum access. In order to avoid interference with the primary use of the spectrum, such cognitive devices must be thoroughly tested. In this paper, we present a high time-resolution model of spectrum occupancy, stemming from the activity of primary users, for testing purposes. The proposed model is based on a few statistical parameters and includes a novel parameter adaptation procedure that improves the accuracy of current models significantly. The intended use of the model is over-the-air testing of cognitive devices, for instance for prototyping purposes, e.g. evaluation of the achievable performance, or for conformance testing. The model parameters are extracted from measurement data in the GSM 900 downlink band obtained at the Ilmenau University of Technology campus. However, the modeling approach is not restricted to GSM 900 but lends itself to other bands and radio technologies, too.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666206","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666206.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666206","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"596","endPage":"600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High time-resolution spectrum occupancy model for testing of cognitive radio devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"High time-resolution spectrum occupancy model for testing of cognitive radio devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666206/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666206/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916085","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High time-resolution spectrum occupancy model for testing of cognitive radio devices","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p596schirmer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065345S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666207,"authors":[{"name":"Eleftherios Chatziantoniou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Eleftherios","lastName":"Chatziantoniou","id":"37085531233"},{"name":"Ben Allen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Allen","id":"37274755600"},{"name":"Vladan Velisavljevi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Vladan","lastName":"Velisavljevi\u0107","id":"37295040500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666207","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Hidden Markov models","Cognitive radio","Markov processes","Autoregressive processes","Predictive models","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","hidden Markov models","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HMM-based spectrum occupancy predictor","energy efficient cognitive radio","radio spectrum usage","spectrum sensing algorithms","prediction methods","channel occupancy","energy consumption","time consumption","hidden Markov model","ISM band","1-nearest neighbour predictor","1NN predictor","frequency 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","channel occupancy prediction","energy efficiency","hidden Markov model","spectrum sensing"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sensing is the cornerstone of cognitive radio technology and refers to the process of obtaining awareness of the radio spectrum usage in order to detect the presence of other users. Spectrum sensing algorithms consume considerable energy and time. Prediction methods for inferring the channel occupancy of future time instants have been proposed as a means of improving performance in terms of energy and time consumption. This paper studies the performance of a hidden Markov model (HMM) spectrum occupancy predictor as well as the improvement in sensing energy and time consumption based on real occupancy data obtained in the 2.4GHz ISM band. Experimental results show that the HMM-based occupancy predictor outperforms a kth order Markov and a 1-nearest neighbour (1NN) predictor. Our study also suggests that by employing such a predictive scheme in spectrum sensing, an improvement of up to 66% can be achieved in the required sensing energy and time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An HMM-based spectrum occupancy predictor for energy efficient cognitive radio","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666207","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666207.pdf","startPage":"601","endPage":"605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An HMM-based spectrum occupancy predictor for energy efficient cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666207/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901969","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An HMM-based spectrum occupancy predictor for energy efficient cognitive radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p601chatziantoniou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044843S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666209,"authors":[{"name":"Yuya Saito","affiliation":["Radio Access Network Development Department, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuya","lastName":"Saito","id":"37085580430"},{"name":"Anass Benjebbour","affiliation":["Radio Access Network Development Department, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Anass","lastName":"Benjebbour","id":"37294604500"},{"name":"Yoshihisa Kishiyama","affiliation":["Radio Access Network Development Department, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihisa","lastName":"Kishiyama","id":"37299879400"},{"name":"Takehiro Nakamura","affiliation":["Radio Access Network Development Department, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takehiro","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37366274600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666209","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":482,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":8698},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666209","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Gain","Resource management","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","radio access networks","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FRA","LTE radio interface","receiver","successive interference canceller","future radio access","nonorthogonal multiple access","downlink NOMA","system level performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-orthogonal multiple access","future radio access","successive interference canceller","Adaptive modulation and coding"]}],"abstract":"As a promising downlink multiple access scheme for further LTE enhancement and future radio access (FRA), this paper investigates the system-level performance of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with a successive interference canceller (SIC) on the receiver side.

A closed form expression is derived analytically for the worst SIR, outage probability, and Spectral Efficiency (SE). The proposed analytical technique is used to configure a FFR solution for the downlink of OFDMA cellular system. The analysis is performed using two-tiers cellular network with uniform user density and for three different cases of FFR, namely, Frequency Reuse Factor (FRF) = 3, FRF=4 and sectored FFR. The inner radius configuration depends on equalizing the worst SIR for both inner and outer edges of the cell. Numerical results show that sectored FFR yields the highest SE and low outage probability. Sectored FFR highly balances the needs of interference reduction and resource efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666210","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666210.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of Fractional Frequency Reuse based on worst case Signal to Interference Ratio in OFDMA downlink systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666210/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of Fractional Frequency Reuse based on worst case Signal to Interference Ratio in OFDMA downlink systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916105","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666210/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of Fractional Frequency Reuse based on worst case Signal to Interference Ratio in OFDMA downlink systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p616hashima.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059935S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666213,"authors":[{"name":"Shingo Yoshizawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kitami Institute of Technology, Kitami, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Yoshizawa","id":"37270688500"},{"name":"Masahiro Sugitani","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information and Science Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Sugitani","id":"37086678076"},{"name":"Yoshikazu Miyanaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information and Science Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikazu","lastName":"Miyanaga","id":"37270680800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666213","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Correlation","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver antennas","MIMO line-of-sight channels","space division multiplexing","SDM","multiple-input multiple-output channels","communication throughput","LOS channels","multipath channels","cover","reflector","corner conditions","passage conditions","grove conditions","farm conditions","spatial correlation coefficient"]}],"abstract":"Space division multiplexing (SDM) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is effective in increasing communication throughput.

This paper presents effectiveness of cover and reflector in receiver antennas to overcome the throughput degradation in MIMO LOS channels. We compare communication characteristics of farm, grove, passage, and corner conditions and report that parameters of SNR, spatial correlation coefficient and received power ratio are important to prospect actual throughput rather than eigenvalue difference. The farm condition resulting in the lowest throughput has a high SNR, however induces a high spatial correlation coefficient which is close to 1. According to the aforementioned results, cover and reflector is fabricated to decrease the high spatial correlation coefficient and keep the received power ratio between received antennas. By using the cover and reflector, the farm condition has recovered almost the same throughput as the passage condition.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666213","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666213.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"631","endPage":"635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effectiveness of cover and reflector in receiver antennas for MIMO line-of-sight channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effectiveness of cover and reflector in receiver antennas for MIMO line-of-sight channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666213/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902028","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666213/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effectiveness of cover and reflector in receiver antennas for MIMO line-of-sight channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p631yoshizawa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07712S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666214,"authors":[{"name":"Mustapha Benjillali","affiliation":["Communications Systems Department, NPT, Rabat, Morocco"],"firstName":"Mustapha","lastName":"Benjillali","id":"37295778800"},{"name":"Amal Hyadi","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Amal","lastName":"Hyadi","id":"38246659700"},{"name":"Daniel Benevides da Costa","affiliation":["Wireless Telecommunications Research Group (GTEL), Federal University of Cear\u00e1 (UFC), CE, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Benevides da Costa","id":"37541972000"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666214","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Fading","Interference","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Relays","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami channels","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio spectrum management","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive multihop regenerative relaying systems","underlay spectrum sharing","with m-QAM detect-and-forward relaying strategy","m-quadrature amplitude modulation","identical Nakagami-m fading channels","bivariate Meijer G-functions","closed-form analysis framework","univariate Meijer G-functions","outage probability","ergodic capacity"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we investigate the performance of cognitive multihop regenerative relaying systems in the \u201cunderlay\u201d spectrum sharing scenario.

However, it changes the frequency-domain spectrum shape and hence increases the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of transmit signal. In this paper, we introduce the selective mapping (SLM), which is typically used in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), to reduce PAPR of SC transmission using joint Tx/Rx MMSE-FDE. The SLM is applied to the frequency-domain SC signal after applying the transmit FDE (Tx-FDE) and prior to inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). It is shown, by computer simulation, that the SLM can reduce PAPR without significant effect on bit-error rate (BER). Performance of SLM is also evaluated in various phase-rotation sequence types, in both deterministic and random points of views, and number of candidates. Computational complexity of the proposed transmission scheme employing SLM algorithm is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666215","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International

subcarriers in each OFDM symbol due to I/Q imbalance between the inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) branches at the transmit and receive sides. One of the widely-used metrics to evaluate the performance degradation due to I/Q imbalance is the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). The instantaneous subcarrier SINR can be represented as a ratio conditioned on a particular channel realization and the exact SINR is evaluated by averaging over the channel realizations. In the literature, it is common to approximate the SINR by taking the average of the numerator and denominator separately although the two are not independent. In this paper, we calculate the exact SINR under the assumption that each pair of interfering subcarriers experiences uncorrelated channel realizations. We show that the SINR grows as the logarithm of the input SNR when the receiver has I/Q imbalance. On the other hand, under transmit-only I/Q imbalance, there is an SINR ceiling for large input SNR. Therefore, transmitter side I/Q imbalance is more harmful, in terms of average SINR, than receiver-only I/Q imbalance. We also show that, the approximate SINR expression, commonly used in the literature, is not accurate for large input SNR values, except for the case of transmit-only I/Q imbalance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact SINR analysis of OFDM systems under joint Tx/RX I/Q imbalance","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666216","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666216.pdf","startPage":"646","endPage":"650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Exact SINR analysis of OFDM systems under joint Tx/RX I/Q imbalance","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666216/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902226","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact SINR analysis of OFDM systems under joint Tx/RX I/Q imbalance","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p646ozdemir.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052789S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6666218,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Javad Abdoli","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Canada Co.

The proposed technique, which is called weighted circular convolution, totally removes the signal overheads, while preserving the real-orthogonality of the prototype filter, and as such, does not incur any ISI/ICI on the demodulated OQAM symbols. It is based on extension of the finite-length OQAM sequence to infinite-length such that the resulting signal is periodic. This periodicity together with special structure of OFDM/OQAM enables one to transmit only the desired overhead-removed portion of signal. This is equivalent to a weighted circular convolution instead of linear convolution in the OFDM/OQAM modulator/demodulator. The spectral sidelobe augmentation due to the sharp edge transitions of the overhead-removed signal is resolved by a weighted time-domain windowing. The proposed overhead-removal technique is applicable to an OFDM/OQAM burst of arbitrary length (either even or odd) and, among other benefits, significantly improves the spectral efficiency especially for short-burst signals.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666218","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666218.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted circularly convolved filtering in OFDM/OQAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666218/","displayDocTitle":"Weighted circularly convolved filtering in OFDM/OQAM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901846","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666218/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted circularly convolved filtering in OFDM/OQAM","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p657abdolihoseinabadi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041233S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666219,"authors":[{"name":"Nico Surantha","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Iizuka, Fukuoka"],"firstName":"Nico","lastName":"Surantha","id":"38076112800"},{"name":"Yuhei Nagao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Iizuka, Fukuoka"],"firstName":"Yuhei","lastName":"Nagao","id":"37300972900"},{"name":"Masayuki Kurosaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Iizuka, Fukuoka"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Kurosaki","id":"37284046100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ochi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Iizuka, Fukuoka"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37300847100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666219","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"abstract":"Sampling frequency offset (SFO) that occurs due to a sampling frequency mismatch between the transmitter and receiver oscillators is one of the main problem in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based digital terrestrial television (DTTV) system. The SFO can cause an intersymbol interference and an intercarrier interference that may degrade the performance of an OFDM system and result in high bit error rate. Since the value of SFO is usually very low (part per million scale), the SFO estimation is very susceptible to a noise. In this paper, we propose the estimation method that can minimize the influence of the noise in SFO estimation and also minimize the computational complexity. The performance of the proposed method has been verified with computer simulation. The computer simulation results show that the proposed sampling frequency offset estimation is more efficient in computational complexity compared to the conventional method to achieve the similar performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666219.pdf","startPage":"662","endPage":"666","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computationally efficient sampling frequency offset estimation for OFDM-based digital terrestrial television systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Noise","Complexity theory","Bit error rate","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","digital television","error statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling frequency mismatch","transmitter oscillator","receiver oscillator","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","DTTV system","intersymbol interference","intercarrier interference","bit error rate","noise minimization","computational complexity minimization","computer simulation","SFO estimation","OFDM-based digital terrestrial television systems","computationally-efficient sampling frequency offset estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A computationally efficient sampling frequency offset estimation for OFDM-based digital terrestrial television systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666219/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916076","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computationally efficient sampling frequency offset estimation for OFDM-based digital terrestrial television systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p662surantha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056795S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666221,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassan M.

First, the diversity orders that can be achieved over this channel are investigated. The study is based on the partitioning of the channel onto several paths whose individual diversity order add to attain the maximum diversity carried by the channel. Next, we study the performance of space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation (ST-BICM), consisting of a coded modulation concatenated to a space-time rotation, over the MIMO-MH-AF quasi-static fading channel with perfect feedback. We propose upper bounds on the diversity orders that a ST-BICM can attain if a limited feedback from the destination to all the nodes is available. These bounds provide a tradeoff between attainable diversity, detector complexity, and coding rates. Finally, word error rate performances of several schemes with up to three bits of feedback are compared to outage probabilities, which represents the fundamental limit over quasi-static fading channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666221.pdf","startPage":"672","endPage":"676","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding for the MIMO multi-hop amplify-and-forward fading channel with limited feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Relays","Fading","Modulation","MIMO","Antennas","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel coding","diversity reception","fading channels","feedback","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probabilities","coding rates","detector complexity","space-time rotation","coded modulation concatenated","ST-BICM","space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation","maximum diversity","diversity orders","perfect feedback","MIMO-MH-AF quasi-static fading channel","multiple-input multiple-output","limited feedback","channel coding","MIMO multihop amplify-and-forward fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Coding for the MIMO multi-hop amplify-and-forward fading channel with limited feedback","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666221/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916088","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for the MIMO multi-hop amplify-and-forward fading channel with limited feedback","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p672kraidy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04752S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666222,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["IETR, INSA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37534378000"},{"name":"Maryline H\u00e9lard","affiliation":["IETR, INSA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Maryline","lastName":"H\u00e9lard","id":"37269770700"},{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois H\u00e9lard","affiliation":["IETR, INSA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"H\u00e9lard","id":"37269844900"},{"name":"Matthieu Crussi\u00e8re","affiliation":["IETR, INSA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Crussi\u00e8re","id":"37269848800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666222","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"abstract":"In this work, a new fast-decodable space-time block code (STBC) is proposed.

In this paper, we study on the optimal closed-loop STCs with low-complexity receivers and any amount of feedback. A unified framework for designing closed-loop STCs is firstly proposed by extending the conventional linear dispersion codes to the cases with feedback. Then a new design method is proposed, where the stochastic gradient descent algorithm is employed to obtain optimal set of LDC candidates particularly for spacetime coded systems with linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver. The proposed method allows for flexible system parameters such as the number of transmit/receive antennas, modulated symbols and the length of codewords thus include most of the existing closed-loop STCs. Simulation results confirm the advantages of the newly-proposed design method of closed-loop STCs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666223/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666223/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916122","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Design of closed-loop space-time codes with MMSE receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of closed-loop space-time codes with MMSE receivers","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p682wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064974S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666224,"authors":[{"name":"Chenggao Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Chenggao","lastName":"Han","id":"37290294500"},{"name":"Takeshi Hashimoto","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37266621400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666224","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel deterministic inter-leaver, called almost linear interleaver (ALI) as the generalization of block and linear interleavers, and discusses its parameter/depth selection for coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (COFDM) system over Rayleigh fading channel.

In this system, two multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) base stations serve two single antenna users. A MIMO shared relay retransmits the lost packets to the target users. First, we study the system with direct retransmission from the base station and derive a closed form expression for the outage probability of the system. We show that the direct retransmission can overcome the fading, however, it cannot overcome the interference. After that, we invoke the shared relay and design the relay beamforming matrices such that the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is improved at the users subject to power constraints on the relay. In the case when the transmission of only one user fails, we derive a closed form solution for the relay beamformers. On the other hand when both transmissions fail, we pose the beamforming problem as a sequence of non-convex feasibility problems. We use semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to convert each feasibility problem into a convex optimization problem. We ensure a rank one solution, and hence, there is no loss of optimality in SDR. Simulation results are presented showing the superior performance of the proposed relay beamforming strategy compared to direct ARQ system in terms of the outage probability.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666227","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666227.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"703","endPage":"707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal beamforming for MIMO shared relaying in downlink cellular networks with ARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal beamforming for MIMO shared relaying in downlink cellular networks with ARQ","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666227/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902067","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666227/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal beamforming for MIMO shared relaying in downlink cellular networks with ARQ","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p703hosny.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057245S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666228,"authors":[{"name":"Praneeth Jayasinghe","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu 4500, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Praneeth","lastName":"Jayasinghe","id":"37085408095"},{"name":"L.K.

The optimal transmit beamforming vector will be sent back to the transmitter via a dedicated feedback link. We derive closed-form expressions for the cumulative density function, probability density function, and moments to statistically characterize the properties of the instantaneous SNR. These statistical properties are used to analyze the performance of the system with outage probability, average bit error rate, and ergodic capacity. The results of the performance analysis reveal that Rician factor and number of antennas at the nodes improve the system performance, and the optimal single stream beamforming system provides better error performance than an orthogonal space-time block coded based AF MIMO system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666228.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"712","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of optimal beamforming in AF MIMO relaying over asymmetric fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Relays","Array signal processing","Rician channels","Antennas","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","array signal processing","error statistics","MIMO communication","probability","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)","Rician channels","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AF MIMO relaying network","asymmetric fading channels","optimal single stream beamforming","multiple-input multiple-output relay network","noncoherent dual-hop amplify-and-forward relaying","relay-destination channels","source-relay channels","Rician fading channel","Rayleigh fading channel","channel state information","receive beamforming vectors","optimal transmit beamforming vectors","instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","dedicated feedback link","transmitter","cumulative density function","closed-form expressions","probability density function","statistical property","outage probability","average bit error rate","ergodic capacity","orthogonal space-time block coded based AF MIMO system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of optimal beamforming in AF MIMO relaying over asymmetric fading channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666228/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902156","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of optimal beamforming in AF MIMO relaying over asymmetric fading channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p708jayasinghe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059584S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666229,"authors":[{"name":"Bruhtesfa E.

However, the performance of coordinated beamforming suffers significantly from Channel State Information (CSI) feedback delay and back-haul delay caused by exchanging CSI through the back-haul link. Hence, designing a beamforming scheme that takes into consideration the different delays incurred by the local and interfering channel links is an important problem. In this paper, average Virtual SINR based criterion is used to design an optimal combination of Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) and Intercell Interference Cancellation (IIC) beamformers as a function of the feedback and back-haul delays. Although it is well known that MRT is close to optimality at low SNR and IIC better at high SNR, we demonstrate how the optimal solution is modified when taking feedback delays into account. In particular, our results suggest the egoistic strategy is much more robust with respect to delays, thus affecting the shape of the optimal beamformer and giving extra performance for a wide range of scenarios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"713","endPage":"718","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666229.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated beamforming in multicell networks with Channel State Information exchange delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666229/","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated beamforming in multicell networks with Channel State Information exchange delays","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902153","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated beamforming in multicell networks with Channel State Information exchange delays","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p713godana.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055149S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666230,"authors":[{"name":"Dhananjaya Ponukumati","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Sciences and Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dhananjaya","lastName":"Ponukumati","id":"37888436800"},{"name":"Feifei Gao","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Sciences and Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37289304900"},{"name":"Mathias Bode","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Sciences and Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Mathias","lastName":"Bode","id":"37892145700"},{"name":"James C.

Interestingly, numerical results show that the obtained solutions fulfill the rank constraint and are therefore exact.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"719","endPage":"723","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666230.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust coordinated downlink beamforming for multicell-cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666230/","displayDocTitle":"Robust coordinated downlink beamforming for multicell-cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916086","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust coordinated downlink beamforming for multicell-cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p719ponukumati.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063583S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666233,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Gokceoglu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Gokceoglu","id":"37658708500"},{"name":"Sener Dikmese","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Sener","lastName":"Dikmese","id":"37294228900"},{"name":"Mikko Valkama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Valkama","id":"37267657500"},{"name":"Markku Renfors","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Renfors","id":"37279773600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666233","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Sensors","Integrated circuits","Covariance matrices","Receivers","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","interference suppression","probability","radio receivers","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","signal detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF IQ imbalance mitigation","eigenvalue based multichannel spectrum sensing method","direct-conversion radio receiver","cognitive radio device","CR device","RF circuit imperfection","maximum-to-minimum eigenvalue testing","false alarm probability","waveform level interference cancellation","optimum cancellation coefficient","practical sample estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eigenvalue based detection","direct-conversion receiver","multichannel sensing","RF impairments","IQ imbalance"]}],"abstract":"Direct-conversion radio receivers can provide highly-integrated and low-cost hardware solutions for cognitive radio (CR) devices. However, such receiver structures are also known to suffer from various RF circuit imperfections, especially IQ imbalance. When studying the performance of various spectrum sensing methods, most existing work in literature neglect the effects of such RF imperfections. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a well-known eigenvalue based sensing method, namely maximum-to-minimum eigenvalue test, in the challenging multichannel spectrum sensing context under sensing receiver RF IQ imbalance. It is analytically shown that under RF IQ imbalance, the false alarm probability of the spectrum sensor is always higher compared to ideal RF front-end case. Then, in order to compensate for such degradation in the ability to identify free spectrum, a waveform level interference cancellation solution is deployed to enhance the performance, and optimum cancellation coefficient together with a practical sample estimator are formulated. Extensive computer simulations are provided to illustrate the degradation of false alarm probability in the presence of practical IQ imbalance values. Furthermore, the simulations also show that the proposed interference cancellation method can efficiently suppress the IQ imbalance effects, achieving identical false alarm probability with the ideal RF front-end case.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666233","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666233.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666233","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"734","endPage":"739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and mitigation of RF IQ imbalance in eigenvalue based multichannel spectrum sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and mitigation of RF IQ imbalance in eigenvalue based multichannel spectrum sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666233/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666233/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916125","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and mitigation of RF IQ imbalance in eigenvalue based multichannel spectrum sensing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p734gokceoglu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053571S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666234,"authors":[{"name":"George A.

By considering the discrepancy in sensing reliability of different SUs, we extended the existing researches to propose an optimal cooperative sensing (OCS) scheme based on normalized energy detection (NED) by considering reporting errors, i.e., the fusion center (FC) may receive erroneous results from some SUs due to channel fading. It is derived that the proposed OCS scheme is the linear combination of modified local detection statistics. The optimal combining coefficient is just a function of the numbers of the antennas and the received signal samples, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the variance of the reporting errors at each SU. Meanwhile, the performance of the proposed OCS scheme, the well-known equal gain combination (EGC) method and the maximum normalized energy (MNE) detector with reporting errors is analytically derived, respectively. Furthermore, to avoid the prior information of each SU's SNR and the variance of the reporting errors, and simplify the decision-making as well as threshold setting, a sub-optimal cooperative spectrum sensing (SOCS) is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed OCS and SOCS schemes all perform much better than the existing EGC and MNE methods.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666235","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666235.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666235","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"745","endPage":"749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalized energy detection based cooperative spectrum sensing with reporting errors in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Normalized energy detection based cooperative spectrum sensing with reporting errors in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666235/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666235/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902235","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalized energy detection based cooperative spectrum sensing with reporting errors in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p745luo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106185S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666236,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel L\u00f3pez-Ben\u00edtez","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-Ben\u00edtez","id":"38274759600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666236","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Accuracy","Estimation error","Channel estimation","Market research","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cognitive radio","decision making","radio spectrum management","signal detection","statistical analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum access paradigm","spectrum occupancy pattern","DSA-CR system","licensed channel state","statistical information","decision-making process","periodic imperfect spectrum sensing decision","channel idle-busy period","minimum period duration","primary activity statistics estimation"]}],"abstract":"Owing to the opportunistic nature of the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) paradigm based on the Cognitive Radio (CR) concept, the behaviour and performance of DSA/CR systems depend on the spectrum occupancy pattern of the primary system. DSA/CR systems can monitor periodically the occupancy state of licensed channels in order to gain statistical information on their occupancy patterns, and exploit this information in decision-making processes. Based on the outcomes of periodic spectrum sensing decisions, DSA/CR systems can make an estimation of the duration of the channel idle/busy periods and compute relevant statistics such as the minimum period duration, the moments (e.g., mean and variance) and the underlying distribution. However, the imperfect performance of spectrum sensing methods may lead to inaccuracies on the estimated statistics. In this context, this work carries out a detailed simulation-based study on the impact of imperfect spectrum sensing performance on the estimation of the primary activity statistics. The relative impact of various parameters is analysed and quantified, and guidelines to properly configure the spectrum sensing function of DSA/CR systems are provided. Moreover, several methods to overcome sensing errors are proposed and evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666236","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666236.pdf","startPage":"750","endPage":"755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Can primary activity statistics in Cognitive Radio be estimated under imperfect spectrum sensing?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666236/","displayDocTitle":"Can primary activity statistics in Cognitive Radio be estimated under imperfect spectrum sensing?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901780","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666236/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Can primary activity statistics in Cognitive Radio be estimated under imperfect spectrum sensing?","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p750lopezbenitez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048802S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6666238,"authors":[{"name":"Kei Nishimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37085685553"},{"name":"Shoya Takebuchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoya","lastName":"Takebuchi","id":"38247073200"},{"name":"Fumiaki Maehara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiaki","lastName":"Maehara","id":"37298056500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666238","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Nonlinear distortion","OFDM","Resource management","Uplink","Computer simulation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit error rate performance","BER performance","uplink OFDMA","nonlinear fading channels","frequency spectrum","uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access","nonlinear distortion","subcarrier allocation methods","localized FDMA","interleaved FDMA","LFDMA","IFDMA","mobile station","MS","out-band radiation","computer simulation","input back-off","IBO","theoretical derivation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes the theoretical derivation method of both the frequency spectrum and the bit error rate (BER) performance for uplink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) in the presence of the nonlinear distortion.

Therefore, it is meaningful to clarify this difference by means of the theoretical approach. The feature of the proposed approach is to represent both the frequency spectrum and the BER performance by the simple series form formula, which enables us to overview these performances without any time-consuming computer simulations.

So far, various clipping and filtering techniques have been proposed in the literature, which have different performance in terms of PAPR reduction and signal distortion. However, the minimum signal distortion required to achieve a given PAPR level, i.e., the ultimate performance of clipping and filtering techniques, has not been investigated. In this paper, clipping and filtering is interpreted as a procedure of adding an extra signal to the original signal. Based on this, the ultimate performance problem of clipping and filtering techniques can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, by solving which we obtain the ultimate performance of clipping and filtering techniques. Subsequently, using this ultimate performance we evaluate the performance of several famous clipping and filtering techniques and provide the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666242","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666242.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultimate performance of clipping and filtering techniques for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666242/","displayDocTitle":"Ultimate performance of clipping and filtering techniques for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901961","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666242/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultimate performance of clipping and filtering techniques for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p782zhu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051716S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666243,"authors":[{"name":"Hoang Duy Nguyen","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw \u2014 Kapeldreef, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Hoang Duy","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086777349"},{"name":"Ubaid Ahmad","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw \u2014 Kapeldreef, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ubaid","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37587803700"},{"name":"Min Li","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw \u2014 Kapeldreef, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Li","id":"37291655700"},{"name":"Liesbet Van der Perre","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw \u2014 Kapeldreef, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Liesbet","lastName":"Van der Perre","id":"37271995400"},{"name":"Rudy Lauwereins","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw \u2014 Kapeldreef, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Rudy","lastName":"Lauwereins","id":"37266921700"},{"name":"Sofie Pollin","affiliation":["Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (IMEC) vzw \u2014 Kapeldreef, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Sofie","lastName":"Pollin","id":"37271990100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666243","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Complexity theory","Vectors","Lattices","Bit error rate","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","MIMO communication","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LR-aided SSSD","Monte Carlo simulations","computational complexity","scalable heuristics","reduced-complexity candidate list generation method","soft-output information","LR-aided linear hard-output MIMO detection algorithm","linear MIMO detectors","near-optimal multiple-input multiple-output detectors","wireless MIMO systems","soft-output lattice reduction-aided selective spanning sphere decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lattice Reduction","MIMO detection","Sphere Decoder"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, the algorithmic optimizations and implementations of near-optimal Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) detectors have been an area of active research. Lattice Reduction (LR) has shown to be a promising technique to improve the performance of linear MIMO detectors. However, LR-aided linear hard-output MIMO detection is still far from optimal. Practical systems use soft-output information to exploit gains from coded systems in order to yield near-optimal performance. In this paper, the LR-aided Selective Spanning Sphere Detection algorithm is proposed as a reduced-complexity candidate list generation method for soft-output MIMO detection, specifically optimized for practical MIMO-OFDM systems. This algorithm uses efficient and scalable heuristics based on simple processor-friendly operations that significantly contribute to lowering the computational complexity of the MIMO detection problem. Results from Monte Carlo simulations reveal that LR-aided SSSD is a promising algorithm that is capable of providing near-optimal performance whilst being especially computationally efficient, in comparison to other algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computationally efficient soft-output Lattice Reduction-aided Selective Spanning Sphere Decoder for wireless MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666243","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666243.pdf","startPage":"786","endPage":"790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A computationally efficient soft-output Lattice Reduction-aided Selective Spanning Sphere Decoder for wireless MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666243/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916093","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computationally efficient soft-output Lattice Reduction-aided Selective Spanning Sphere Decoder for wireless MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p786nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053647S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666244,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Thein","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Technologies (IKT), Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Thein","id":"37712437300"},{"name":"Martin Fuhrwerk","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Technologies (IKT), Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Fuhrwerk","id":"38490294900"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Peissig","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Technologies (IKT), Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Hannover, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Peissig","id":"38526253800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666244","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Estimation","Interference","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","computational complexity","error statistics","frequency-domain analysis","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","resource allocation","synchronisation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization","noncontiguous FBMC systems","filter bank multicarrier methods","in-band systems","frequency-based signal processing approaches","time-based signal processing approaches","OQAM implementation","spectral-efficient offset-QAM implementation","NC-OFDM system design","bit-error rate","BER","signal-to-interference ratio","time offset estimation","frequency offset estimation","resource allocation scenarios","computational complexity","frequency domain processing","time domain processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666244","abstract":"The problem of synchronization in non-contiguous OFDM (NC-OFDM) in the presence of other in-band systems is addressed by means of a comparison between time-and frequency-based signal processing approaches.

In this paper, we propose a novel blind CFO estimation method for interleaved OFDMA uplink based on distributed Bayesian compressive sensing (DBCS) theory. Considering the received signal structure, the new method first constructs a measurement matrix associated with a sparse signal matrix weight, which sets up the stage for the application of CS theory in tackling the original estimation problem. Then, the DBCS theory that exploits a common sparse profile of the sparse signal matrix weight is employed to distributively estimate a sparse hyperparameter vector, whose significant peaks are linked to the correct estimation of the multiple CFOs. Compared with the existing subspace theory based methods, the proposed scheme offers a significant enhancement in estimation accuracy, in specific in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666246.pdf","startPage":"801","endPage":"806","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Bayesian compressive sensing based blind carrier-frequency offset estimation for interleaved OFDMA uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Multiple signal classification","Sparse matrices","Vectors","Accuracy","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","compressed sensing","frequency division multiple access","frequency estimation","OFDM modulation","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed Bayesian compressive sensing theory","blind carrier-frequency offset estimation","interleaved OFDMA uplink","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing access systems","multiuser uplink transmission","multiple-parameter estimation problem","blind CFO estimation method","DBCS theory","measurement matrix","received signal structure","sparse signal matrix weight","sparse hyperparameter vector","subspace theory based methods","low signal-to-noise ratio region","SNR region"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Bayesian compressive sensing based blind carrier-frequency offset estimation for interleaved OFDMA uplink","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666246/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902303","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Bayesian compressive sensing based blind carrier-frequency offset estimation for interleaved OFDMA uplink","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p801cheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077178S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666247,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Asvadi","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Asvadi","id":"37546663800"},{"name":"Tad Matsumoto","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Tad","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37277382600"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666247","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666247","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Correlation","Markov processes","Bit error rate","Joints","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","binary codes","combined source-channel coding","concatenated codes","decoding","error statistics","Markov processes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint distributed source-channel decoding technique","LDPC-coded binary Markov sources","correlated binary Markov sources","additive white Gaussian noise channel","AWGN channels","short-length low-density parity-check codes","bit sequences","JSCD technique","source correlations","temporal correlations","sum-product decoder","SP decoder","BCJR decoder","concatenated decoder","frame-bit error rate","FER-BER","source memory"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel joint decoding technique for distributed source-channel (DSC) coded systems for transmission of correlated binary Markov sources over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.

The JSCD technique is composed of two stages, which are iteratively performed. First, a sum-product (SP) decoder is serially concatenated with a BCJR decoder, where the knowledge of source memory is utilized during local (horizontal) iterations. Then, the estimate of correlation between the sources is used to update the concatenated decoder during global (vertical) iterations. Therefore, the correlation of the sources is assumed as side information in the subsequent global iteration of each concatenated decoder.

In this paper this concept is extended to the vertical dimension by providing additional cells with higher downtilt while retaining the naturally resulting interference avoidance properties. Simulations for UMTS HSDPA show that with the additional cell layer with vertical downtilt can increase the average user throughput by 126% and the throughput of the worst 5th percentile by 205%, compared to a traditional 3 sector macrocell configuration. It is shown that the proposed cell configuration also outperforms conventional 6 sector configurations with the same number of antennas and cells per site. Furthermore, it is shown that the addition of the second cell layer does not significantly increase the handover failure rates over conventional cell configurations.

A multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) downlink beamforming system with accurate channel state information (CSI) at user terminals is considered. The optimization of feedback bits allocation to different partitions and channel direction indicator (CDI), channel quality indicator (CQI) corresponding to each partition has been performed exploiting quantization mean square error (MSE). The impacts of equal and unequal partitioning, and the number of partitions on codebook memory and overall system capacity have also been investigated and depicted through simulation results. We have found that with optimized CQI and CDI bits allocations, the amount of bits allotted to equal and unequal partitions are proportional to the size ratios of the respective partitioned sub-vectors. It has also been observed that for small-sized partitions, the optimal ratio of CDI to CQI is much smaller than that of large-sized partitions.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666253","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666253.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666253","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"841","endPage":"845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback budget allocation optimization for P-VQ in downlink beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Feedback budget allocation optimization for P-VQ in downlink beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666253/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666253/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901985","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback budget allocation optimization for P-VQ in downlink beamforming","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p841kibria.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086778S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666254,"authors":[{"name":"Hayato Fukuzono","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Hayato","lastName":"Fukuzono","id":"38266789000"},{"name":"Tomoki Murakami","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Murakami","id":"37398124300"},{"name":"Riichi Kudo","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Riichi","lastName":"Kudo","id":"37319844500"},{"name":"Yasushi Takatori","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasushi","lastName":"Takatori","id":"37265912800"},{"name":"Masato Mizoguchi","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Mizoguchi","id":"37311931000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666254","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":191},"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel calibration scheme for implicit feedback beamforming on downlink (DL) multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In the proposed scheme, an access point (AP) calculates calibration coefficients from ratios of DL and uplink (UL) channel state information (CSI) corresponding to multiple stations (STAs), and then combines multiple coefficients with minimum mean square error (MMSE) weights. Although it is difficult to calculate MMSE weights since Gaussian noise terms due to estimated CSI error exist in the denominator of the mean square error, we derive the weights using a linear approximation in the highsignal to noise power ratio (SNR) regime. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme obtains signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) gain of more than 6.9 dB over a calibration scheme without combining, at 10% cumulative distribution function (CDF) and SNR of 40 dB. It is found that the proposed scheme improves the calibration accuracy considerably.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666254.pdf","startPage":"846","endPage":"850","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted-combining calibration for implicit feedback beamforming on downlink multiuser MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","MIMO","Training","Estimation","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","calibration","Gaussian noise","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted-combining calibration","implicit feedback beamforming","downlink multiuser MIMO systems","calibration scheme","multiple-input multiple-output systems","calibration coefficients","uplink channel state information","downlink channel state information","multiple stations","access point","minimum mean square error","MMSE weights","Gaussian noise","estimated CSI error","mean square error","linear approximation","signal to noise power ratio regime","SNR regime","signal to interference plus noise power ratio","cumulative distribution function","calibration accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Weighted-combining calibration for implicit feedback beamforming on downlink multiuser MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666254/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902246","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted-combining calibration for implicit feedback beamforming on downlink multiuser MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p846fukuzono.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074059S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666255,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Dotlic","affiliation":["Dependable Wireless Laboratory, National Institute for Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Dotlic","id":"38232092900"},{"name":"Ryu Miura","affiliation":["Dependable Wireless Laboratory, National Institute for Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryu","lastName":"Miura","id":"37267299500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666255","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","Arrays","Correlation","Array signal processing","Timing","Antenna arrays","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","personal area networks","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital baseband signal generation","IEEE 802.15.6-2012","IEEE 802.15.4a-2007","IEEE 802.15 IR-UWB standards","IR-UWB symbol","correlation beamforming paradigm","chirp beamformer","impulse radio ultra-wideband beamforming structure","IR-UWB beamforming structure","sample-rate digital beam steering","chirp impulse radio ultrawideband antenna array"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666255","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel type of Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) beamforming structure that we named a chirp beamformer.

In comparison with a correlation beamformer, the chirp beamformer requires considerably lower timing resolution in cases where the IR-UWB symbol consists of a relatively long single uninterrupted waveform, as in the mandatory modes of two of the IEEE 802.15 IR-UWB standards, namely IEEE 802.15.4a-2007 and IEEE 802.15.6-2012. Furthermore, the bandwidth of the signal that the chirp beamformer generates in the baseband is considerably lower than in the case of the correlation beamformer. Hence, in the case of digital baseband signal generation, the chirp beamformer requires a considerably lower sampling rate than the correlation beamformer. A method for shaping the beam pattern of the chirp beamformer is also described.

However, co-channel interference among cells remains a critical issue. Mitigating co-channel interference leads to a further improvement in spectrum efficiency. To reduce the co-channel interference we proposed vertical plane beam control using precoding and cooperative MIMO transmission. Vertical plane beam control, which controls the vertical plane beam of base station antennas with the use of precoding, can improve overall cell capacity since SINR (Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio) at each mobile station in the coverage area can be significantly improved. In cooperative MIMO transmission, adjacent base stations coordinate to transmit signals to cell-edge mobile stations. This technique can improve cell edge capacity, especially in low SINR areas. If the two techniques are used simultaneously, a synergetic effect can be expected; improved capacity in both the whole cell and cell edge. We propose here a method that combines vertical plane beam control with cooperative MIMO transmission. A computer simulation shows that the spectrum efficiency of the proposed system is approximately 2 times higher for the whole cell and 3 times higher for cell edge users than the conventional system.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666256","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666256.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"856","endPage":"860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput improvement by precoding-based vertical plane beam control and cooperative MIMO transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Throughput improvement by precoding-based vertical plane beam control and cooperative MIMO transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666256/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901761","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666256/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput improvement by precoding-based vertical plane beam control and cooperative MIMO transmission","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p856hoshino.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059693S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666262,"authors":[{"name":"Osamah S.

Enormous high data rate supporting devices are entering todays market. They demand for high rate wireless indoor coverage for their uninterrupted service. The main challenge lies in working with the existing wireless technologies while providing a future proof centralized optical fiber indoor backhaul for efficient indoor coverage. Fiber to the room paradigm is gaining a lot of attention in this regard. For supporting high data rates indoor, multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) is definitely a prominent choice. While quality of service serves as the most attractive feature that should be ensured among the mobile terminals (MTs). In this work we propose a throughput fair successive signal to leakage and noise ratio (SLNR) precoding algorithm for such a fiber-wireless (Fi-Wi) MU-MIMO indoor. The network capacity and individual MT data rate for our proposed scheme are compared against the greedy SLNR scheme and a random selection based SLNR precoding scheme. The Jains fairness index value for our scheme is shown to achieve maximal fairness.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666265","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"902","endPage":"906","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A throughput fair SLNR scheduling algorithm for hybrid Fi-Wi indoor downlink MU-MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A throughput fair SLNR scheduling algorithm for hybrid Fi-Wi indoor downlink MU-MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666265/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901852","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666265/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A throughput fair SLNR scheduling algorithm for hybrid Fi-Wi indoor downlink MU-MIMO","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p902debbarma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052544S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666266,"authors":[{"name":"Tokihito Watanabe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tokihito","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37086670332"},{"name":"Kenta Umebayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenta","lastName":"Umebayashi","id":"37330418700"},{"name":"Yasuo Suzuki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuo","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37275440600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666266","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Estimation","Delays","Multiaccess communication","Ad hoc networks","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","channel estimation","code division multiple access","delay estimation","modulation","probability","spread spectrum communication","timing","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation success rate probability","signature waveform","spreading code signal","signal modulation","asynchronous DS-CDMA","autonomous decentralized network","delay timing estimation","subspace-based blind channel order estimation"]}],"abstract":"Subspace-based blind channel estimation techniques have been investigated to enable high quality CDMA communication. In the case of receiving multiple independent signals modulated by the same spreading code, accurate channel estimation for a single signal without information about channel orders and delay timing may be difficult. However, this issue has not been investigated deeply. In the case of autonomous decentralized network, receiving same spreading code signals can occur. In this paper, we propose a subspace based blind channel order and delay timing estimation method for the same spreading code signals. This method exploits the orthogonality between the signal subspace consisting of signature waveforms and the noise subspace and provides an estimation result for one of the received signals. We evaluated the proposed method in terms of probability of estimation success rate, and showed that the proposed method can achieve proper estimation performance.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666266","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666266.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"907","endPage":"911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel order and delay timing estimation in autonomous decentralized network using asynchronous DS-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel order and delay timing estimation in autonomous decentralized network using asynchronous DS-CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666266/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902024","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666266/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel order and delay timing estimation in autonomous decentralized network using asynchronous DS-CDMA","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p907watanabe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065381S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666267,"authors":[{"name":"Piya Patcharamaneepakorn","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research (CCR), University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Piya","lastName":"Patcharamaneepakorn","id":"38265979100"},{"name":"Simon Armour","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research (CCR), University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Armour","id":"37271546200"},{"name":"Angela Doufexi","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research (CCR), University of Bristol, UK"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Doufexi","id":"37276844100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666267","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Land mobile radio","Ink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","matched filters","MIMO communication","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","minimum mean square error receivers","matched filter","linear receivers","iterative precoding algorithm","precoder design","linear transmit filter design","signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio","multiuser MIMO systems","modified leakage-based transmit filter design"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a modified definition of signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) as a criterion for linear transmit filter design in Multi-user MIMO systems. The proposed metric incorporates receiver structures into the precoder design, which can potentially exploit unused receive signal subspaces in cases where the available eigenmodes are not fully transmitted. The improvement in terms of the degrees of freedom of the precoder is also elaborated. In addition, an iterative precoding algorithm is proposed and is studied with two linear receivers, namely the matched filter (MF) and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional SLNR scheme and can achieve further improvement with an MMSE receiver, at the expense of increased computational complexity and slow convergence rate. Moreover, the proposed scheme is shown to reduce its form to the conventional scheme when full-eigenmode transmission is assumed.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666267","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666267.pdf","startPage":"912","endPage":"916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified leakage-based transmit filter design for multi-user MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666267/","displayDocTitle":"A modified leakage-based transmit filter design for multi-user MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902018","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666267/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified leakage-based transmit filter design for multi-user MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p912patcharamaneepakorn.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048305S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6666272,"authors":[{"name":"Daehan Ha","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Daehan","lastName":"Ha","id":"38529355500"},{"name":"Keonkook Lee","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Keonkook","lastName":"Lee","id":"37635893100"},{"name":"Joonhyuk Kang","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Joonhyuk","lastName":"Kang","id":"37288717500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666272","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Interference","Integrated circuit modeling","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","energy conservation","MIMO communication","power amplifiers","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency analysis","circuit power consumption","massive MIMO systems","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","multiple cellular systems","large-scale antenna arrays","power amplifier","transmit power","analog devices","residually lossy factors","base stations","BS","quasi-concave function"]}],"abstract":"It was shown that the required transmit power to support a target achievable rate is inversely proportional to the number of antennas in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems [1]. However, the consumed power of the massive MIMO systems should include not only transmit power but also the fundamental power for operating the circuit at the transmitter, because the effect of circuit power consumption is more serious when the transmitter is equipped with massive number of antennas. Hence, to analyze the exact power consumption of massive MIMO systems, we investigate the energy efficiency for multiple cellular systems with large-scale antenna arrays under a consideration of circuit power consumption of each antenna. In particular, we propose a new power consumption model that considers not only transmit power on the power amplifier but also circuit power dissipated by analog devices and residually lossy factors in base stations (BSs). Through new energy efficiency formulation based on the proposed power consumption model, we analyze the tendency of the energy efficiency as the number of antennas increases and can see that the energy efficiency becomes a quasi-concave function with respect to the number of antennas. Finally, from the derived function of the energy efficiency, we determine the number of antennas to provide the maximum energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666272","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666272.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"938","endPage":"942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency analysis with circuit power consumption in massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency analysis with circuit power consumption in massive MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666272/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901900","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666272/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency analysis with circuit power consumption in massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p938ha.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064341S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666273,"authors":[{"name":"Fabien H\u00e9liot","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Fabien","lastName":"H\u00e9liot","id":"37579508400"},{"name":"Muhammad Ali Imran","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Muhammad Ali","lastName":"Imran","id":"37265529100"},{"name":"Rahim Tafazolli","affiliation":["Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Rahim","lastName":"Tafazolli","id":"37280285600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666273","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Tin","Resource management","Joints","Relays","Complexity theory","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","energy conservation","MIMO communication","optimisation","radio links","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economical sustainability","environmental sustainability","next generation communication network","cooperative communication","near-optimal energy-efficient joint resource allocation algorithm","multihop multiple-input-multiple-output amplify-and-forward system","MIMO AF system","multivariate unconstrained EE-based problem","low-complexity algorithm","optimization"]}],"abstract":"Energy efficiency (EE) is becoming an important performance indicator for ensuring both the economical and environmental sustainability of the next generation of communication networks.

In the proposed setup, we consider a secondary network composed by one source node communicating with the best one out of L available destinations, selected according to the channel quality of the direct links. If the selected direct link drops below a given threshold, a half-duplex decode-and-forward relaying transmission strategy is invoked, and then the selected secondary destination employs a maximal-ratio combining technique to combine the received signals from the secondary source and relay. In our analysis, the overall transmit power at the secondary network is considered to be limited by the maximum tolerable interference power at the primary user receiver, as well as by the maximum transmit power available at the secondary nodes. A closed-form expression for the outage probability is obtained and validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, an asymptotic analysis is carried out and reveals that the achievable diversity order equals L+1.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666283.pdf","startPage":"997","endPage":"1001","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage analysis of a spectrally efficient scheme for multiuser cognitive relaying networks with spectrum sharing constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon","Interference","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity reception","Receivers","Closed-form solutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods","radio spectrum management","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrally efficient scheme","multiuser cognitive relaying networks","spectrum sharing constraints","secondary network","source node","channel quality","direct links","half-duplex decode-and-forward relaying transmission strategy","secondary destination","maximal-ratio combining technique","maximum tolerable interference power","primary user receiver","maximum transmit power","closed-form expression","outage probability","Monte Carlo simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Outage analysis of a spectrally efficient scheme for multiuser cognitive relaying networks with spectrum sharing constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666283/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902174","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage analysis of a spectrally efficient scheme for multiuser cognitive relaying networks with spectrum sharing constraints","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p997benitezolivo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070731S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666284,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelrahman M.

In this paper, we analyze the coverage probability in cellular networks assuming repulsive point processes for the base station deployment. In particular, we characterize, analytically using stochastic geometry, the downlink probability of coverage under a Matern hardcore point process to ensure minimum distance between the randomly located base stations. Assuming a mobile user connects to the nearest base station and Rayleigh fading, we derive two lower bounds expressions on the downlink probability of coverage that is within 4% from the simulated scenario. To validate our model, we compare the probability of coverage of the Matern hardcore topology against an actual base station deployment obtained from a public database. The comparison shows that the actual base station deployment can be fitted by setting the appropriate Matern point process density.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666284","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666284.pdf","startPage":"1002","endPage":"1007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage probability analysis for wireless networks using repulsive point processes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666284/","displayDocTitle":"Coverage probability analysis for wireless networks using repulsive point processes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902254","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666284/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage probability analysis for wireless networks using repulsive point processes","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1002ibrahim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120113S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6666285,"authors":[{"name":"Satoshi Suyama","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Suyama","id":"37297955700"},{"name":"Jiyun Shen","affiliation":["NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Jiyun","lastName":"Shen","id":"37537782000"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Oda","affiliation":["NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Oda","id":"37287495100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Suzuki","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37289218200"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Fukawa","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Fukawa","id":"37296656900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666285","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Antennas","Antenna measurements","Bit rate","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","demodulation","microwave antennas","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM outdoor transmission","super high bit rate mobile communications","mobile station","MS","transmitter antennas","receiver antennas","throughput performance levels","demodulation","off-line mode","received signals","measurement course","64QAM","frequency 11 GHz","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","bandwidth 400 MHz","bit rate 11.8 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents detailed results of 11 GHz band outdoor transmission experiments employing 8 \u00d7 16 MIMO-OFDM for 10 Gbps super high bit rate mobile communications.

Moreover, it is proved that BS-MIMO benefits from the use of small sized antenna arrays outperforming in terms of capacity conventional MIMO systems that operate poorly due to spatial correlation. However, the open issues towards an implementable, fully functional BS-MIMO system are still plenty. This study is part of a series of research work that focuses on real-world BS-MIMO system design. The application of limited feedback techniques in BS-MIMO is introduced and the performance of the developed algorithm is evaluated. These results are also used to derive conclusions regarding the adaptivity requirements for the parasitic elements of the ESPAR antenna. Moreover, a practical V-BLAST reception scheme using receiver radiation pattern adaptation is also presented.

In this paper, we study coordinated beamforming to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of multi-cell multi-antenna systems meanwhile ensuring the individual data rate requirement of each user. To find a solution of the non-convex optimization problem for the precoding design, we construct a convex subset of the original constraint set and a quasi-concave lower bound of the EE. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm to maximize the lower bound of the EE within the convex subset. We evaluate the EE of the proposed algorithm through simulations under different data rate requirements, user locations, and cell-edge signal-to-noise ratios. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder is much more energy-efficient than the transmit power minimization precoder when the circuit power consumption dominates, and always outperforms two interference-free transmission schemes with the optimized transmit power toward maximizing the EE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13901768","htmlLink":"/document/6666291/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient coordinated beamforming with individual data rate constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient coordinated beamforming with individual data rate constraints","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1040li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054768S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666294,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Shun Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Shun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086295128"},{"name":"Yao-Win Peter Hong","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Win Peter","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276994800"},{"name":"Wen-Tsuen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University"],"firstName":"Wen-Tsuen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085553169"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666294","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666294","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Array signal processing","Batteries","Throughput","Renewable energy sources","Wireless communication","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","concave programming","convex programming","geometric programming","power control","radio networks","renewable energy sources","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional water-filling algorithm","nonconvex optimization problem","successive approximation","geometric programming problems","condensation method","channel coefficients","offline policy","numerical simulations","CI beamforming scheme","battery storage constraints","energy causality","MRT beamforming schemes","maximal ratio transmit beamforming schemes","channel inversion beamforming schemes","multiantenna wireless system","offline-online power control policy","renewable energy","base stations","power control","downlink multiuser beamforming scheme"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666294","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666294.pdf","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink multiuser beamforming and power control for base stations empowered by renewable energy","abstract":"This work examines offline and online power control policies for efficient usage of renewable energy in the downlink of a multi-antenna wireless system. Two multiuser beamforming schemes are considered, namely, channel inversion (CI) and maximal ratio transmit (MRT) beamforming schemes. Power control policies are derived for both schemes, respectively, with the goal of maximizing the sum throughput by a deadline subject to energy causality and battery storage constraints. With CI beamforming, the power control problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, whose solution can be obtained using the directional water-filling algorithm. With MRT beam-forming, the power control problem becomes non-convex, due to interference between the signals intended for different users, and, thus, is difficult to solve exactly. However, an efficient solution can be obtained by performing successive approximation into a sequence of geometric programming problems, i.e., by employing the condensation method. Offline power control policies are first derived assuming non-causal knowledge of the energy arrival and channel coefficients over time. Online power control policies are then proposed based on observations gained from the offline policy. The performance of the proposed schemes are demonstrated through numerical simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666294/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13902063","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666294/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Downlink multiuser beamforming and power control for base stations empowered by renewable energy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink multiuser beamforming and power control for base stations empowered by renewable energy","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1056wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069478S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666297,"authors":[{"name":"Yahia Hassan","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Communication Technology Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yahia","lastName":"Hassan","id":"38264969100"},{"name":"Raphael T.

While these effects have been thoroughly investigated for point to point MIMO, only isolated results are available on the effect of such phenomena on performance of relaying systems. This paper tries to fill part of this void. Specifically we study the impact of lossless and lossy compact antenna arrays on multiuser amplify and forward (AF) relaying in the presence of different noise sources. We optimize the gain allocation for sum rate maximization under a dissipated power constraint. For compact arrays this constraint is more relevant than the commonly used radiated power constraint. We provide an extensive insight-oriented discussion of our results, some of which may appear counterintuitive at first glance. We show that for compact MIMO relaying the standard model, considering only channel correlation but ignoring antenna coupling and noise correlation, is insufficient and may lead to a wrong system characterization.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666297","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"10710","endPage":"1076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO relaying with compact antenna arrays: Coupling, noise correlation and superdirectivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO relaying with compact antenna arrays: Coupling, noise correlation and superdirectivity","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666297/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902209","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666297/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO relaying with compact antenna arrays: Coupling, noise correlation and superdirectivity","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1071hassan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102725S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666300,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Qian","affiliation":["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shen","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085714775"},{"name":"Meng Cheng","affiliation":["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38473978400"},{"name":"Khoirul Anwar","affiliation":["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), Ishikawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Khoirul","lastName":"Anwar","id":"37396266500"},{"name":"Tad Matsumoto","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Tad","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37277382600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666300","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666300","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rician channels","Signal to noise ratio","Rayleigh channels","Resource management","Relays","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power allocation","1st order diversity","LOS component power","line-of-sight component power","2nd order diversity","SNR","signal-to-noise power ratio","block Rayleigh fading channels","bit-flipping model","correlated binary information sequences","Slepian-Wolf transmission system","Rician fading channels","correlated sources transmission","outage probability analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666300","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666300.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage probability analysis for correlated sources transmission over Rician fading channels","abstract":"In this paper, the outage probability of a Slepian-Wolf transmission system is analysed theoretically.

The KPC is especially suitable for the three-dimensional (3D) multiuser multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Besides, channel state information feedback based on the best companion cluster scheme is investigated. Since all codewords have been grouped into several clusters, each user feeds back its best precoding matrix index, best interference cluster index and channel quality information, then the BS pairs and schedules users according to the received feedback. Different codewords clustering methods affect the performance of the limited feedback schemes. We proposes two kinds of codewords clustering methods based on 3D beam patterns, including both the symmetric and asymmetric one. Simulation shows that with properly clustered codewords, our proposed 3D MU-MIMO feedback scheme has a significant throughput gain against 2D MU-MIMO feedback scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A limited feedback scheme for 3D multiuser MIMO based on Kronecker product codebook","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666308","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666308.pdf","startPage":"1130","endPage":"1135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A limited feedback scheme for 3D multiuser MIMO based on Kronecker product codebook","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666308/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902273","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A limited feedback scheme for 3D multiuser MIMO based on Kronecker product codebook","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1130xie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097832S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666310,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, P.

Currently, to obtain transmit diversity, space-time code is usually used. In this paper, a new multiplicative transformation scheme is proposed for multiple antenna systems with non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. It is shown that this scheme can provide transmit diversity. In the scheme, for the first antenna, the modulated LDPC codeword is directly applied, while for the second antenna, before modulation, a multiplicative transformation is used, where the multiplication is defined in the same Galois field as that used to construct the nonbinary LDPC code. The performance of the proposed system is analyzed, and it is shown that, compared with phase sweeping transmit diversity (PSTD) and Alamouti's space-time block code (STBC), the proposed system not only provides transmit diversity, but also achieves good gain. Simulation results further prove the increased performance in both block fading and slow fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666310","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666310.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"1141","endPage":"1145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit diversity based on multiplicative transformation for non-binary LDPC codes in MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmit diversity based on multiplicative transformation for non-binary LDPC codes in MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666310/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902263","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666310/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit diversity based on multiplicative transformation for non-binary LDPC codes in MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1141zheng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061394S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666312,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Fadlallah","affiliation":["Technop\u00f4le Brest Iroise CS, Universit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Yasser","lastName":"Fadlallah","id":"38267169700"},{"name":"Amir Khandani","affiliation":["University of Waterloo"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Khandani","id":"37274294200"},{"name":"Karine Amis","affiliation":["Technop\u00f4le Brest Iroise CS, Universit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Karine","lastName":"Amis","id":"37294246200"},{"name":"Abdeldjalil A\u00efssa-El-Bey","affiliation":["Technop\u00f4le Brest Iroise CS, Universit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Abdeldjalil","lastName":"A\u00efssa-El-Bey","id":"38266471700"},{"name":"Ramesh Pyndiah","affiliation":["Technop\u00f4le Brest Iroise CS, Universit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Pyndiah","id":"37269802500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666312","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Decoding","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Joints","Receivers","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete constellation","K-user MIMO interference channels","receive diversity order","transmitter side","receiver side","joint linear precoding design","joint cut-off rate","tight lower bound","joint mutual information","high signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","closed-form solution","precoding matrices","low computational complexity","local channel state information knowledge","decoding interference","substantial bit error rate","sum-rate improvements"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of decoding and precoding in the K-user MIMO interference channels.

This solution is characterized by its low computational complexity, and only requires a local channel state information knowledge at the transmitters.

Unlike previous works on this topic, which mainly considered the impact of inter-cell disturbance due to pilot reuse (so-called pilot contamination), we are concerned with the computational complexity. The conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) and minimum variance unbiased (MVU) channel estimators rely on inverting covariance matrices, which has cubic complexity in the multiplication of number of antennas at each side. Since this is extremely expensive when there are hundreds of antennas, we propose to approximate the inversion by an L-order matrix polynomial. A set of low-complexity Bayesian channel estimators, coined Polynomial ExpAnsion CHannel (PEACH) estimators, are introduced. The coefficients of the polynomials are optimized to yield small mean square error (MSE). We show numerically that near-optimal performance is achieved with low polynomial orders. In practice, the order L can be selected to balance between complexity and MSE. Interestingly, pilot contamination is beneficial to the PEACH estimators in the sense that smaller L can be used to achieve near-optimal MSEs.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666313","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666313.pdf","startPage":"1157","endPage":"1162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity channel estimation in large-scale MIMO using polynomial expansion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666313/","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity channel estimation in large-scale MIMO using polynomial expansion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916163","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666313/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity channel estimation in large-scale MIMO using polynomial expansion","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1157shariati.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073801S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666315,"authors":[{"name":"Chenxi Hao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Chenxi","lastName":"Hao","id":"37085459374"},{"name":"Bruno Clerckx","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Clerckx","id":"37269077900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666315","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency division multiaccess","Transmitters","Vectors","Switches","Frequency-domain analysis","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","frequency division multiple access","frequency-domain analysis","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["S33/2 scheme","zero-forcing beamforming","FDMA","frequency division multiple access","suboptimal schemes","CSI feedback quality","degree-of-freedom region","upper-bound","transmitter","channel state information","frequency domain two-user multiple-input-single-output broadcast channel","transmission strategy","DoF region","imperfect CSIT","matched CSIT","MISO broadcast channel"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution, we focus on a frequency domain two-user Multiple-Input-Single-Output Broadcast Channel (MISO BC) where the transmitter has imperfect and (un)matched Channel State Information (CSI) of the two users in two subbands.

In this paper, we study the outage performance of an amplify-and-forward (AF)-based TWR system with multiple relays where a single relay selection is performed based on outdated CSI. Specifically, we consider a single relay selection scheme in AF-based TWR system under outdated CSI conditions and offer a statistical analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio per hop with the given policy.

The relay decodes the information from the sources and it re-encodes them to generate some extra redundancy, which is modulated onto real data symbols and transmitted to the destination with a time offset equal to half the signal interval. Hence, the proposed scheme can be regarded as a distributed OFDM/OQAM scheme between the source and the relay. The proposed scheme achieves good performance in terms of bit error rate. Moreover, it does not require insertion of guard interval achieving therefore spectral efficiency gain.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666320.pdf","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1200","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed coding/modulation scheme with OFDM/OQAM based transmission for wireless cooperative relays systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Bit error rate","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Wireless communication","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","cooperative communication","decoding","network coding","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed coding-modulation scheme","OFDM-OQAM based transmission","wireless cooperative relay systems","wireless broadcast networks","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bandwidth allocation","real value data symbols","relay decoding","guard interval","spectral efficiency gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative communications","relay networks","OFDM/OQAM","pulse shaping filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed coding/modulation scheme with OFDM/OQAM based transmission for wireless cooperative relays systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666320/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901831","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed coding/modulation scheme with OFDM/OQAM based transmission for wireless cooperative relays systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1196youssef.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086843S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666321,"authors":[{"name":"Myeong-Jin Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Myeong-Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"38239189600"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"},{"name":"Hyun-Ho Lee","affiliation":["LG Electronics, Advanced Communication Technology Laboratory, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37538532300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666321","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Matrix decomposition","Vectors","Array signal processing","MIMO","Simulation","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","feedback","filtering theory","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment scheme","filter design","limited feedback","two-cell interfering MIMO-MAC channel","multiinput and multioutput multiple access channel","antenna configuration","interference leakage power","quantization error","feedback bit function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Limited feedback","matrix quantization","interference alignment"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, considering a two-cell interfering MIMO multiple access channel (MIMO-MAC), we propose an interference alignment scheme with an efficient limited feedback and investigate the conditions for the antenna configuration.

So far, important practical aspects of self-interference cancellation have not been considered, such as receiver amplifier saturation and dynamic range, which extend the minimum distance between transmit and receive antennas without sufficient interference isolation. Further, current solutions lack significant self-interference attenuation for wideband signals. In this paper, a method for canceling a passband self-interference signal using adaptive filtering in the digital domain is presented. Based on acoustic active noise cancellation foundations, a cancellation signal is created that destructively combines with the undesired self-interference signal in the passband, taking into account differences in the complex passband nature of RF signals versus the baseband nature of acoustic signals. The efficacy of this interference cancellation scheme is compared to other self-interference cancellation architectures in the literature including digital as well as other active passband approaches. It is shown that for high-power wideband transmission signals, this adaptive active analog cancellation method effectively reduces the self-interference signal while satisfying practical constraints set by transceiver hardware. It is also shown that this approach decreases the minimum distance between the transmit and receive antennas or allows higher transmission power, thereby extending the range of a full-duplex device.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Interference","Passband","Attenuation","Wireless communication","Transceivers","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","receiving antennas","signal denoising","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active self-interference cancellation","passband signals","gradient descent","same-frequency-same-time full-duplex radiofrequency communication","colocated transmitter","receiver amplifier saturation","dynamic range","transmit antennas","receive antennas","acoustic active noise cancellation foundations","cancellation signal","RF signals","acoustic signals","active passband approaches","high-power wideband transmission signals","adaptive active analog cancellation method","transceiver hardware","full-duplex device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666323","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666323","startPage":"1212","endPage":"1216","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666323.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666323/","displayDocTitle":"Active self-interference cancellation of passband signals using gradient descent","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13901983","htmlLink":"/document/6666323/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active self-interference cancellation of passband signals using gradient descent","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1212krier.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068081S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666324,"authors":[{"name":"Young Yun Kang","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical Eng., Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Young Yun","lastName":"Kang","id":"37402827100"},{"name":"Byung-Jae Kwak","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications, Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Jae","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37281260500"},{"name":"Joon Ho Cho","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical Eng., Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"firstName":"Joon Ho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276361800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666324","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666324","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Receiving antennas","Vectors","Transmitting antennas","Optimization","Array signal processing","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","concave programming","interference suppression","quadratic programming","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay","joint analog-digital domain self-interference cancellation","FD-AF relay","multiple transmit antennas","end-to-end spectral efficiency","average power constraint","relay receive antenna","RF chain","nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem","optimal beamforming vector","closed algorithmic expression","systematic reduction","constraint set partitioning","half-duplex relay","HD AF relay","duplexing loss compensation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a joint analog and digital domain self-interference cancellation is considered for the full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay with a single receive antenna but multiple transmit antennas. Under the assumption that there is no direct link between a source and a destination, the end-to-end spectral efficiency is maximized subject to the average transmit power constraint at the relay. Unlike previous approaches, an average power constraint is imposed also on the output of the relay's receive antenna to take into account the hardware limitations in the RF chain of the relay's receiver. A nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem is formulated and the optimal beamforming vector is derived in a closed algorithmic expression through the systematic reduction and the partitioning of the constraint set.

Specifically, we propose in the uplink training a rank-q channel approximation method based on compressive sensing (CS) to estimate the most dominant singular subspaces of the global multicell MIMO channel matrix with a modest training length. Then, the estimate of the global channel information is used to design an intercell-interference-aware (IA) zero-forcing (ZF) multicell precoding method in the downlink to mitigate not only the intracell interference but also the intercell interference of the channel. The results obtained using the proposed scheme show a significant improvement in the achievable rates for all users in the cells, particularly the cell-edge users, as compared to the existing channel estimation and precoding methods.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666326","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666326.pdf","startPage":"1227","endPage":"1232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding for multicell massive MIMO systems with compressive rank-q channel approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666326/","displayDocTitle":"Precoding for multicell massive MIMO systems with compressive rank-q channel approximation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902114","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666326/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding for multicell massive MIMO systems with compressive rank-q channel approximation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1227nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060246S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6666327,"authors":[{"name":"Bruhtesfa E.

One of the known techniques to feedback channel direction (eigenvector) information is parametrization using Givens rotations, which is also adopted in IEEE 802.11n standard. In temporally correlated MIMO channels, the feedback overhead can be significantly reduced by using differential quantization techniques such as adaptive delta modulation (ADM). However, the high rate of oscillation and bounded property of Givens rotations makes it difficult to track them using ADM. In this paper, a new method called Adaptive Rotative Quantization (ADRQ) is proposed to quantize Givens rotations in temporally correlated channels. ADRQ quantizes the rotation of eigenvectors between consecutive channel instances using a uniform quantization with an adaptive quantization range. While ADRQ requires the same feedback overhead as ADM, it is demonstrated that ADRQ has significant performance improvement over both ADM and the conventional non-differential quantization at all levels of temporal correlation. Moreover, simulations show that ADRQ converges relatively fast.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666327","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666327.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotative Quantization using adaptive range for temporally correlated MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rotative Quantization using adaptive range for temporally correlated MIMO channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666327/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916139","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666327/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotative Quantization using adaptive range for temporally correlated MIMO channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1233godana.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056875S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666331,"authors":[{"name":"Lina Mroueh","affiliation":["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d'Electronique de Paris, Paris"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Mroueh","id":"37869599800"},{"name":"Emmanuelle Vivier","affiliation":["Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d'Electronique de Paris, Paris"],"firstName":"Emmanuelle","lastName":"Vivier","id":"37266448500"},{"name":"Fatima Zohra Kaddour","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris"],"firstName":"Fatima Zohra","lastName":"Kaddour","id":"38267821600"},{"name":"Mylene Pischella","affiliation":["Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, Paris"],"firstName":"Mylene","lastName":"Pischella","id":"37541339900"},{"name":"Philippe Martins","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech, Paris"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Martins","id":"37288454900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666331","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Interference","Uplink","Transceivers","Resource management","Bandwidth","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","radio transceivers","space division multiplexing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined ZF-ML decoder","uplink scheduling","multiuser MIMO LTE networks","Long Term Evolution networks","transceiver structure","encoder","multiple transmit antenna diversity","joint zero forcing","maximum likelihood decoder","opportunistic multiuser spatial multiplexing allocation","single carrier frequency division multiple access constraints","SC-FDMA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a transceiver structure for the multi-user MIMO uplink channel of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks.

The evaluated rate performances of the proposed transceiver in a scheduling uplink LTE context outperform the ones of other well known decoders.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666331","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666331.pdf","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined ZF and ML decoder for uplink scheduling in multi-user MIMO LTE networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666331/","displayDocTitle":"Combined ZF and ML decoder for uplink scheduling in multi-user MIMO LTE networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901839","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666331/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined ZF and ML decoder for uplink scheduling in multi-user MIMO LTE networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1255mroueh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057332S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666332,"authors":[{"name":"Ashraf Tahat","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications Eng., Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Jordan"],"firstName":"Ashraf","lastName":"Tahat","id":"37326222300"},{"name":"Benoit Champagne","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Eng., McGill University, Que., Canada"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Champagne","id":"37296590000"},{"name":"Claude D'Amours","affiliation":["School of EECS University of Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"D'Amours","id":"37272359800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666332","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Receivers","Long Term Evolution","Bit error rate","Noise","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","channel estimation","computational complexity","fading channels","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace-based channel estimation algorithm","LTE-Advanced","fading channels","computational complexity","active transmitter","pilot sequences","bandwidth-efficient solution","MU-MIMO channels","data blocks","3GPP LTE","blind estimation","BS receiver","base station receiver","spectral efficiency","data rates","uplink transmissions","single-carrier frequency-domain equalization","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems","SC-FDE systems","multiuser MIMO channel estimation","subspace decomposition approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind channel estimation","subspace decomposition","MIMO","LTE-A","SC-FDE","SC-FDMA"]}],"abstract":"Multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems that employ single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) for uplink transmissions can provide high data rates with increased spectral efficiency under severe channel conditions. However, the availability of accurate channel estimates at the base station (BS) receiver is crucial for achieving peak performance. In this paper, we investigate the use of subspace decomposition and derive a novel algorithm for the blind estimation of MU-MIMO channels in SC-FDE systems, as specified by the 3GPP LTE. By exploiting the long data blocks available in LTE standards, our proposed blind algorithm can obtain accurate estimates of the MU-MIMO channels over every block of transmitted data. This provides for a bandwidth-efficient solution in SC-FDE systems by eliminating (reducing) the need to allocate an entire block of pilot sequences for each active transmitter. Furthermore, since the channel estimation is deployed at the BS, the computational complexity is not considered to be a significant burden for future systems in exchange for the increased spectral efficiency. The results of simulations over fading channels, using realistic system parameters representative of LTE-Advanced, demonstrate the advantages of our proposed blind subspace-based channel estimation algorithm and support the feasibility of the resulting MU-MIMO SC-FDE scheme with reduced training.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace decomposition approach to multi-user MIMO channel estimation in SC-FDE systems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666332","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666332.pdf","startPage":"1260","endPage":"1264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Subspace decomposition approach to multi-user MIMO channel estimation in SC-FDE systems","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666332/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916104","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace decomposition approach to multi-user MIMO channel estimation in SC-FDE systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1260tahat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089113S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666333,"authors":[{"name":"Mikko Vehkaper\u00e4","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, School of Electrical Engineering, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Vehkaper\u00e4","id":"37268980400"},{"name":"Taneli Riihonen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland"],"firstName":"Taneli","lastName":"Riihonen","id":"37392216400"},{"name":"Risto Wichman","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland"],"firstName":"Risto","lastName":"Wichman","id":"37269114900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666333","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"abstract":"Bidirectional wireless communication between two multi-antenna terminals that operate in a full-duplex mode is considered. The effects of loopback self-interference and transmit-side noise due to radio front-end imperfections are analyzed in the asymptotic regime where the number of antennas at both terminals grows large. The study compares two transparent mitigation schemes by which conventional spatial multiplexing can operate without being aware of the self-interference issue: spatial-domain null-space projection and time-domain subtractive cancellation. Both schemes eliminate the information-bearing part of the self-interference perfectly, but due to transmitter imperfections, the cancellation approach suffers from residual self-interference. The receive-side null-space projection, on the other hand, suppresses also the transmit-side distortion, but at the cost of reduction in the degrees of freedom available for data reception. The results indicate that suppression becomes preferred when the level of transmit-side noise increases and the receiver does not have instantaneous knowledge about the spatial structure of the self-interference. Exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations also show that the asymptotic analytical results are useful for evaluating the performance of practical not-so-large systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666333.pdf","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1270","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of full-duplex bidirectional MIMO link with transmitter noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Noise","Receivers","Vectors","Time-domain analysis","Multiplexing","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","interference suppression","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","space division multiplexing","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic analysis","full-duplex bidirectional MIMO link","transmitter noise","bidirectional wireless communication","multiantenna terminals","loopback self-interference","transmit-side noise","radio front-end imperfections","transparent mitigation scheme","conventional spatial multiplexing","spatial-domain null-space projection","time-domain subtractive cancellation","self-interference information-bearing part elimination","transmitter imperfection","residual self-interference","receive-side null-space projection","transmit-side distortion suppression","data reception","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of full-duplex bidirectional MIMO link with transmitter noise","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666333/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902224","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic analysis of full-duplex bidirectional MIMO link with transmitter noise","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1265vehkapera.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068636S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666334,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaxiang Xu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Jiaxiang","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Jianhua Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666334","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference","Multiplexing","MIMO","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","correlation methods","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO communication","signal denoising","space division multiplexing","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output techniques","rich scattering environment","spectrum efficiency","diversity gain","successive interference cancellation detection","matching algorithm","orthogonal beams","parallel data streams","butler fixed beamforming network","water-filling power allocation","DOA estimation","uplink direction of arrival estimation","uncorrelated virtual channels","beamforming weights","high spatial correlated channel","SM-STBC","downlink transmission","space-time block coding","spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates a spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme with beamforming and space-time block coding (STBC) for downlink transmission. It combines SM-STBC with beamforming under high spatial correlated channel, and has the advantages of the three techniques. The proposed scheme utilizes beamforming weights to build uncorrelated virtual channels based on uplink direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, and we calculate weights with the help of the water-filling power allocation. The Butler fixed beamforming network is deployed to receive parallel data streams due to its ability to form orthogonal beams. We also propose a matching algorithm linking each data stream to corresponding receive beam, and give the order of successive interference cancellation detection. So the system can transmit parallel data streams as well as providing beamforming and diversity gain. Simulation results show the proposed scheme has a better performance than the benchmark systems under the same spectrum efficiency, and it is suitable for the rich scattering environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme with beamforming and space-time block coding for downlink transmission","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666334","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666334.pdf","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme with beamforming and space-time block coding for downlink transmission","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901959","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme with beamforming and space-time block coding for downlink transmission","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1271xu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072566S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","articleId":"6666334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666335,"authors":[{"name":"Yahya H.

The Rayleigh fading subchannels are assumed to be frequency-nonselective and mutually uncorrelated, whereas the associated Doppler power spectral density is supposed to be symmetric about the origin. In addition, the channel state information (CSI) is considered to be available only at the receiver side. Taking these assumptions into account, and drawing upon known statistical properties for the asymptotic behavior of chi-square processes at low levels, we provide a closed-form approximate solution for the PDF of the outage intervals of the underlying capacity processes.

We present analysis results of the measured data, and compared to the case without the reflector, the channel capacity of the LOS channel is improved by approximately 4.6 bit/s/Hz at 70% of the cumulative distribution function over the entire measurement course when using a reflector.

In order to address the interference issue in LTE-A systems, the linear interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver was introduced. Inter-cell interference suppression in the IRC receiver is provided via simple beam forming on the antenna elements of the receiver, which are calculated using the estimated interference covariance matrix. During the related LTE Rel-11 study item in the 3GPP RAN1 Working Group, the IRC receiver was identified as a promising mechanism for improving the cell-edge user throughput. However, for interfering links employing MIMO schemes with multiple spatial layers or in the case of more than one dominant interfering node, the interference suppression capability of the linear IRC receivers is substantially reduced. In this paper we investigate the performance of advanced non-linear IRC receiver structures for interference suppression. More specifically, we propose a maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) scheme to suppress more than one dominant interfering links.

To effectively manage the intercell interference, a heuristic scheme that jointly considers user scheduling and power control is proposed for multicell orthogonal frequency division multiple-access (OFDMA) networks with BS cooperation and limited backhaul capacity. First, a greedy user scheduling is proposed, taking both channel gain and the cost of directional cooperation into consideration. This scheme schedules the cell-edge users of all cells in the same subchannels. Second, under the guiding of user scheduling, the interference among cell-edge users of different cells can be preferentially cancelled with zero-forcing precoding. Third, a two-step power control is conducted to further improve cell-edge users performance. In the first step, with the strong duality of the nonconvex optimization subproblem, we obtain the minimum power consumption that guaranteeing the cellcenter users' rate requirement. In the second step, the residual power of per cell can be utilized to maximize cell-edge users performance. Then, with the fixed user scheduling, the iteration among interference cancelation and power control can be conducted until the backhaul capacity constraints are satisfied. Performance analysis proves the convergence of the proposed algorithm, and shows the effectiveness of the user scheduling. Simulation results show that, the proposed algorithm achieves a significant improvement of sum-rate for cell-edge users with negligible rate degradation for cell-center users.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications

In the existing solutions, eigen channel of each candidate user was pre-defined at the start of the multi-eigen selection, and this limits user's eigen channel adaptation by the prior knowledge of selected eigens. In E-MES, a successive optimal eigen channel selection is executed during the multi-eigen channel selection, and those procedures can guarantee the selected eigen channel at each step provide more larger contribution to the system sum-rate performance. Furthermore, E-MES can optimize the selected eigen channel set in term of the maximum system sum-rate. Both theoretical analysis and multiple numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate that E-MES solution outperforms some existing dominant solutions, such as L-MDES and L-MES. Although E-MES is proposed for single cell multi-user downlink transmission, it can also be directly extended to the multi-cell multi-user cooperative downlink transmission scenario.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666351","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666351.pdf","startPage":"1356","endPage":"1360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced multi-user eigen channel selection for MIMO downlink transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666351/","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced multi-user eigen channel selection for MIMO downlink transmissions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916113","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666351/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced multi-user eigen channel selection for MIMO downlink transmissions","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1356sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04871S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6666352,"authors":[{"name":"Xueru Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xueru","lastName":"Li","id":"37086765700"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086761394"},{"name":"Limin Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Limin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37367806200"},{"name":"Xibin Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xibin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37365217100"},{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280524700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666352","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":643},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","precoding","radiofrequency interference","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","multiple input multiple output system","multiuser gain","achievable sum rate","single-antenna user number","base station antenna number","SNR region","zero forcing precoding","BER","bit error rate","independent single-user spatial modulation systems","transmit antenna indexes","constellation symbols","interuser interference","spectral efficiency improvement","signal processing complexity reduction","multi-antenna systems","downlink multiuser spatial modulation system"]}],"abstract":"Spatial Modulation is a newly developed concept for multi-antenna systems, which could greatly reduce the signal processing complexity and hardware implementation burden faced by these systems today. To improve the spectral efficiency of spatial modulation system, a novel precoding scheme for downlink multi-user system is proposed in this paper. The precoding scheme not only cancels the inter-user interference, but also preserves the information embedded both in constellation symbols as well as in transmit antenna indexes, decomposing the system into independent single-user spatial modulation systems. Simulation results show that with a high transmission rate, the proposed scheme offers a smaller bit error rate than multi-user Zero Forcing precoding in practical SNR region. With the same base station antenna number and single-antenna user number, it also outperforms Zero Forcing precoding in terms of achievable sum rate. Furthermore, systems using our scheme could achieve a multi-user gain over single-user spatial modulation system.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666352","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel precoding scheme for downlink multi-user spatial modulation system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel precoding scheme for downlink multi-user spatial modulation system","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666352/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901967","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666352/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel precoding scheme for downlink multi-user spatial modulation system","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1361li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074937S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666353,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Tao Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chun-Tao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404174400"},{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Wen-Rong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280430600"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Lo","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Wan-Chi","lastName":"Lo","id":"37086722567"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666353","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"abstract":"One problem in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems is that the transmitted signal from a base station to a user is interfered by the signals to other users. MU-MIMO precoding has been proposed as an effective way to solve the problem. However, most existing precoding methods are mainly designed with zero-forcing (ZF) or minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion and the performance is not optimal. In this paper, we consider a precoding scheme for MU-MIMO systems where maximum-likelihood (ML) detection is used for each user. We propose using a newly developed X-structured precoder which is specifically optimized for the ML detection. In our method, multiuser interference is first mitigated by using a regularized block diagonalization (RBD) technique. Then, an iterative method is used to construct the X-structured precoder so that the performance of the ML detection can be enhanced. Numerical results show that the proposed method can significantly outperform existing precoding methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666353.pdf","startPage":"1366","endPage":"1370","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"X-structured precoder design for multiuser MIMO communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Vectors","Covariance matrices","Receivers","Iterative methods","Resource management","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["X-structured precoder design","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output communication system","MU-MIMO communication system","signal transmission","base station","zero-forcing criterion","ZF criterion","minimum mean-square-error criterion","MMSE criterion","maximum-likelihood detection","ML detection","multiuser interference mitigation","regularized block diagonalization technique","RBD technique","iterative method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"X-structured precoder design for multiuser MIMO communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666353/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916136","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X-structured precoder design for multiuser MIMO communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1366lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089767S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6666354,"authors":[{"name":"Liqiang Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Liqiang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085570722"},{"name":"Baoliang Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Baoliang","lastName":"Li","id":"37086649993"},{"name":"Kaikai Meng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Kaikai","lastName":"Meng","id":"37885427400"},{"name":"Bing Gong","affiliation":["Corporate Research Department, Huawei Technologies CO., LTD, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Gong","id":"37086649907"},{"name":"Yuan Zhou","affiliation":["Corporate Research Department, Huawei Technologies CO., LTD, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37592208300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666354","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Complexity theory","Scheduling algorithms","Equations","Receiving antennas","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","numerical analysis","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user scheduling","multiuser MIMO systems","block diagonalization","multiuser diversity","multiuser scheduling algorithm","scheduling schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fairness","Block Diagonalization","multiuser MIMO systems"]}],"abstract":"In order to exploit multiuser diversity in multiuser MIMO systems with Block Diagonalization, A novel multi-user scheduling algorithm, guarantee both the fairness between users and higher capacity of the system, is proposed in this paper.

Both channel estimation schemes utilize the asymptotic orthogonality between the propagation vectors of different users which would be true only if the number of base station (BS) antennas goes to infinity. However, the limit on the number of BS antennas plus the error on the sample-based covariance matrix of the received signal deteriorate the channel estimate in practice. We derive therefore the closed-form mean-square-error (MSE) of both channel estimates characterizing two aforementioned error sources, which analytically demonstrates that the WL algorithm is superior to the EVD-based one in two folds: it applies more orthogonalized real representations of channel vectors and reduces a typical phase shift in EVD-based estimate to a sign ambiguity. The performance analysis is verified by our numerical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of EVD-based channel estimations in MU-Massive-MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666355","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666355.pdf","startPage":"1376","endPage":"1380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of EVD-based channel estimations in MU-Massive-MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666355/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902098","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of EVD-based channel estimations in MU-Massive-MIMO systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1376guo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06519S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666357,"authors":[{"name":"Longfei Fan","affiliation":["Information Science and Electrical Engineering Department, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Longfei","lastName":"Fan","id":"37086710332"},{"name":"Yabo Li","affiliation":["Information Science and Electrical Engineering Department, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yabo","lastName":"Li","id":"37292396300"},{"name":"Minjian Zhao","affiliation":["Information Science and Electrical Engineering Department, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Minjian","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292300200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666357","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Arrays","Antenna arrays","MIMO","Couplings","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","electromagnetic wave polarisation","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UPA","uniform planar array configuration","ULA","uniform linear array configuration","DP antenna array","single-polarized antenna array","exponential correlation","asymptotic orthogonality","mutual coupling","energy efficiency","spectrum efficiency","MU-MIMO system","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system","base station","exponential correlation matrix","dual-polarized very large antenna array"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666357","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666357.pdf","startPage":"1386","endPage":"1391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-polarized very large antenna array with exponential correlation matrix","abstract":"Using large number of antennas at base station (BS) to formulate a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system, i.e., the massive MIMO, has attracted more and more attention recently, due to the high spectrum and energy efficiency it has.

In this paper, we demonstrate that variations in range can cause significant degradation in performance such as large condition number and low channel capacity for a ULA optimized at a given range. Base on the condition number or capacity of the LOS MIMO channel, we design the optimized non-uniform antenna arrays that can alleviate this problem by keeping small condition number or large capacity over a significantly larger set of ranges than uniformly spaced antenna arrays. And furthermore, based on the optimized results, we find out a simple placement of antenna arrays which can avoid significant performance degradation near the optimized range.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666359","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666359.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"1397","endPage":"1401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of non-uniform antenna arrays for robust millimeter-wave LOS MIMO communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666359","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of non-uniform antenna arrays for robust millimeter-wave LOS MIMO communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666359/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902005","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666359/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of non-uniform antenna arrays for robust millimeter-wave LOS MIMO communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1397zhou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06412S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666359","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666361,"authors":[{"name":"Seong Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Gyeongsang National University, Tongyeong, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Seong Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"38183925300"},{"name":"Bang Chul Jung","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Gyeongsang National University, Tongyeong, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Bang Chul","lastName":"Jung","id":"37289794700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666361","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Throughput","Spread spectrum communication","Joints","Wireless communication","Fading","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","iterative methods","optimisation","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate optimization","HARQ","Rayleigh fading channels","chase-combining type hybrid ARQ strategy","linear multihop relay network","delay-tolerant applications","data rates","joint optimal power allocation-rate selection strategy","iterative algorithm","transmission rates","rate yields","link adaptation schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multihop relay networks","HARQ","Chase combining","power control","rate selection"]}],"abstract":"We consider a linear multihop relay network adopting Chase-combining type Hybrid ARQ strategy in Rayleigh fading channels.

The proposed scheme can achieve full diversity without the requirement of perfect decoding at relays since not only the destination but also the relays benefit from distributed STBC and relay selection.

In orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, such performance degradation arises as a result of intercarrier interference (ICI). We have shown previously that, in conventional non-cooperative communication, certain ICI components (called residual ICI) display high normalized autocorrelation and a partial whitening of the residual ICI can significantly benefit OFDM signal detection. In this work, we show that similar whitening can also be employed in cooperative communication to address the MCFO issue mentioned above. As an illustration, we simulate a distributed spatial-frequency block coding (SFBC) OFDM system subject to highly disparate MCFOs, where in the receiver we perform partial whitening of the residual ICI followed by maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE). The results show that the proposed method can comfortably accommodate a maximum MCFO span well exceeding one subcarrier spacing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of cooperative OFDM signals in time-varying channels with partial whitening of intercarrier interference","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666365","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666365.pdf","startPage":"1426","endPage":"1430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Detection of cooperative OFDM signals in time-varying channels with partial whitening of intercarrier interference","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666365/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901888","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of cooperative OFDM signals in time-varying channels with partial whitening of intercarrier interference","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1426wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077227S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666368,"authors":[{"name":"Antonia Maria Masucci","affiliation":["ETIS/ENSEA, CNRS, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Antonia Maria","lastName":"Masucci","id":"37680671800"},{"name":"Inbar Fijalkow","affiliation":["ETIS/ENSEA, CNRS, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Inbar","lastName":"Fijalkow","id":"37269104600"},{"name":"Elena Veronica Belmega","affiliation":["ETIS/ENSEA, CNRS, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Elena Veronica","lastName":"Belmega","id":"38494615700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666368","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Correlation","Uplink","OFDM","Discrete Fourier transforms","Robustness","Frequency diversity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel coding","correlation theory","discrete Fourier transforms","diversity reception","frequency division multiple access","minimisation","OFDM modulation","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coded OFDMA uplink system","CFO","blockwise subcarrier allocation scheme","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","transmitter","discrete Fourier transform","subcarrier gain","transmission performance degradation","diversity gain","intercarrier sum correlation function minimization","carrier frequency offset"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the optimal blockwise subcarrier allocation scheme in coded Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) uplink systems without channel state information at the transmitter side.

As a consequence, there exist some subcarrier allocation schemes which are preferable to achieve higher diversity gains. We propose the minimization of an inter-carrier sum-correlation function defined as the sum of correlations of each subcarrier with respect to the others in the same allocation scheme.

Moreover, we propose the block-size which provides the best trade-off between diversity and CFO for practical values of CFO.

However, the interference channel is adopted very often in particular due to data sharing limitations of network MIMO. These limitations are due to backhaul links which have finite capacity and also introduce delay. In interference channels, even though data is not exchanged between the transmitters, the global channel state information (CSI) needs to be shared in order to attain the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the channel. This highlights the necessity of reducing the amount of CSI exchange and relying more on local CSI to design the precoders in particular when the local CSI is accurate. In this contribution, cellular downlink transmission using time division duplexing (TDD) is considered where the base stations (BS) can estimate their own channels through reciprocity during the uplink phase. The interfering BSs share their channel estimates via backhaul links of finite capacity. We propose a distributed precoding method based on interference alignment (IA) which is shown to require relatively less CSI exchange compared to other methods.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666369","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666369.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"1446","endPage":"1450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder optimization with local and shared CSI on the K-user MIMO interference channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precoder optimization with local and shared CSI on the K-user MIMO interference channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666369/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916173","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666369/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoder optimization with local and shared CSI on the K-user MIMO interference channel","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1446rezaee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05839S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666375,"authors":[{"name":"Oussama Abassi","affiliation":["CNRS, Centre de Recherche, 56321 Lorient cedex, BP, France"],"firstName":"Oussama","lastName":"Abassi","id":"37071095800"},{"name":"Laura Conde-Canencia","affiliation":["CNRS, Centre de Recherche, 56321 Lorient cedex, BP, France"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Conde-Canencia","id":"38272782600"},{"name":"Mohammad Mansour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Mansour","id":"37266600400"},{"name":"Emmanuel Boutillon","affiliation":["CNRS, Centre de Recherche, 56321 Lorient cedex, BP, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Boutillon","id":"37281706400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666375","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Complexity theory","Receivers","Parity check codes","Frequency-domain analysis","Demodulation","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","demodulation","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","iterative decoding","Monte Carlo methods","parity check codes","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary coded CCSK signaling","simplified LLR generation scheme","single-carrier transmission","SC transmission","nonbinary low-density parity-check code","NB-LDPC","coded cyclic code-shift keying signaling","multipath environment","improved log-likelihood ratio","maximum likelihood demodulation","ML demodulation","circular convolution operations","joint frequency-domain equalization","Monte-Carlo simulations","histogram analysis","SC-FDE systems","Hadamard signaling schemes","perfect channel state information","iterative decoding","2M-ary direct- sequence spread-spectrum technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equalizers","Iterative decoding","Parity check codes","Spread spectrum communication"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the performance of Single-Carrier (SC) transmission with Non-Binary Low-Density Parity-Check (NB-LDPC) coded Cyclic Code-Shift Keying (CCSK) signaling in a multipath environment and we show that the combination of CCSK signaling and non-binary codes results in two key advantages, namely, improved Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) generation via correlations and reduced implementation complexity.

Finally, we demonstrate through Monte-Carlo simulations and histogram analysis that this proposed CCSK signaling scheme gives more robustness to SC-FDE systems than commonly employed Hadamard signaling schemes (a gap of \u2248 1.5dB in favor of CCSK signaling is observed at BER = 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n, assuming perfect Channel State Information).","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666375","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"1478","endPage":"1483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-binary coded CCSK and Frequency-Domain Equalization with simplified LLR generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-binary coded CCSK and Frequency-Domain Equalization with simplified LLR generation","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666375/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901979","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666375/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-binary coded CCSK and Frequency-Domain Equalization with simplified LLR generation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1478abassi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077996S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666379,"authors":[{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Balears, Illes, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillem","lastName":"Femenias","id":"37266545400"},{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, University of the Balearic Islands, Balears, Illes, Spain"],"firstName":"Felip","lastName":"Riera-Palou","id":"38276004600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666379","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Niobium","OFDM","Delays","Vectors","Scheduling","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","protocols","quality of service","queueing theory","scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosslayer unified approach","protocol","continuous rate allocation","discrete rate allocation","continuous power allocation","uniform power allocation","telecommunication traffic","resource allocation algorithm","channel aware QoS-guaranteed crosslayer scheduling algorithm","queue aware QoS-guaranteed crosslayer scheduling","channel state information","heterogeneous QoS","resource utilisation","imperfect CSIT","OFDMA","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In MIMO-OFDMA systems, scheduling and resource allocation algorithms are crucial to optimize the resource utilization while providing support to applications with heterogeneous QoS requirements.

With the goal of maximizing either the instantaneous or long-term network capacity, we propose BER-driven resource allocation (BRA) schemes which exploit both channel state information (CSI) and target BER of each traffic flow. Simulations results show that the average spectral efficiency of the BRA-like schemes is superior to that of the conventional schemes which only consider one BER constraint and thus the chosen BER constraint has to be the strictest one out of multiple BER requirements. The performance gap between these schemes increases when the average signal-to-ratio (SNR) increases. Besides that, the average spectral efficiency increases when the target BER ratio of one user to the other users increases. In other words, our proposed methods enhance wireless resource utilization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER-driven resource allocation in OFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666381","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666381.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"BER-driven resource allocation in OFDMA systems","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666381/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916111","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER-driven resource allocation in OFDMA systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1513tham.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073376S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666382,"authors":[{"name":"Chongtao Guo","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Chongtao","lastName":"Guo","id":"38667082800"},{"name":"Min Sheng","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37410574200"},{"name":"Xijun Wang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xijun","lastName":"Wang","id":"38667163200"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405814700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666382","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Throughput","Resource management","Downlink","Wireless communication","Linear programming","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","frequency division multiple access","integer programming","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximization","long-term Jain index","short-term Jain index","wireless resource allocation","long-term fairness","short-term fairness","optimal tradeoff","single cell downlink OFDMA systems","slot allocation problem","subchannel problem","nonlinear integer programming problem","short-term convex optimization problems","suboptimal solution","Jain index constraint","optimal relaxed system throughput"]}],"abstract":"In wireless resource allocation, improving system throughput and simultaneously enhancing user fairness are two fundamental but contradictory objectives. As for fairness, both short-term and long-term fairness are of significant importance. However, less effort has been dedicated to explore the optimal tradeoff between system throughput and the two mentioned fairness in terms of widely used Jain's index. In this context, we aim to maximize system throughput subject to constraints on both short-term and long-term fairness in single cell downlink OFDMA systems. The difficulty of this issue lies in that the considered subchannel and slot allocation problem is a nonlinear integer programming problem, and furthermore seems to be non-causal. To overcome these challenges, we first relax the integer variables. Second, we prove that short-term fairness ensures long-term fairness so that the long-term fairness constraint is redundant and can be removed. Third, the problem is decomposed into a sequence of short-term convex optimization problems that can be easily solved. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves a good suboptimal solution with small deviations from the optimal relaxed system throughput and the Jain's index constraint.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666382","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"1518","endPage":"1522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput maximization with short- and long-term Jain's index guarantees in OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Throughput maximization with short- and long-term Jain's index guarantees in OFDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666382/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901757","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666382/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput maximization with short- and long-term Jain's index guarantees in OFDMA systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1518guo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083811S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6666385,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Yang","id":"37677338600"},{"name":"Marco Moretti","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Moretti","id":"37302219500"},{"name":"WenXiang Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"WenXiang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37589118100"},{"name":"Weidong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280464200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666385","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Complexity theory","Wireless communication","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","OFDM","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","graph theory","greedy algorithms","OFDM modulation","radio networks","resource allocation","set theory","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load minimization","admission control","OFDMA wireless networks","radio resource allocation techniques","maximum weighted independent set","MWIS","graph theory","minimal weighted-degree greedy algorithm","MWDG algorithm","control information","base station","constant bit rate traffic model"]}],"abstract":"To cope with the ever increasing demand for bandwidth and increasing number of users, future wireless networks will be designed with the radio resource allocation techniques able to get good performance with low complexity and feedback.

Interference is the major performance limitation is such networks, and global coordination of coexisting transmissions comprises the technology enabler for achieving high performance levels. In this work we consider large distributed networks of low-cost infrastructure nodes, such as small-cells or simply access points. We explore optimal and efficient strategies for selecting the serving access point for each user (access point/user pairing) and tuning the transmission power per communication link, in order to achieve uniform quality-of-service levels across the whole network. For this purpose, we reformulate the original intractable joint pairing and power optimization problem, leveraging the powerful integer linear programming optimization framework. We also propose lower-complexity coordination algorithms by decoupling the pairing and power allocation sub-problems. We evaluate the proposed algorithms performance in large dense access networks and we demonstrate how to guarantee specific rates over increased user population by infrastructure densification and network resources coordination.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications

paper proposes joint user association and energy-efficient resource allocation in the uplink of multi-user two-tier Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) subject to user's maximum transmission power and minimum-rate constraints. The proposed scheme aims at achieving high rates at low powers satisfying the user's quality-of-service (QoS) constraints (in terms of minimumrate requirements) by offloading the users with low signal to noise ratio (SNR) from macrocell to the pico base station (BS). A channel-to-noise-ratio (CNR)-based rate proportional resource allocation approach is proposed to transform the minimumrate constraint into a minimum required transmission power constraint on each subcarrier. The single-user single-carrier and multi-user multi-carrier energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems are then solved under maximum and minimum power constraints using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The impact of users' maximum transmission power and minimumrate requirements on EE and throughput are investigated through illustrative results. The rate-proportional approach is evaluated against the equal rate allocation approach for different user associations and various numbers of users, maximum transmission power, and circuit powers. Significant gains in EE can be achieved for the HetNets if the path loss based user association is combined with the proposed CNR rate proportional mechanism.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13902105","htmlLink":"/document/6666404/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Joint user association and energy-efficient resource allocation with minimum-rate constraints in two-tier HetNets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint user association and energy-efficient resource allocation with minimum-rate constraints in two-tier HetNets","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1634pervaiz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051275S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666407,"authors":[{"name":"Zhicai Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Zhicai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37071186400"},{"name":"Haijun Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Haijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406815600"},{"name":"Zhenmin Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Zhenmin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37598694400"},{"name":"Hui Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37071573500"},{"name":"Xiangming Wen","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Xiangming","lastName":"Wen","id":"37397329700"},{"name":"Wenpeng Jing","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing"],"firstName":"Wenpeng","lastName":"Jing","id":"37085450046"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666407","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Power control","Complexity theory","Interference","Femtocell networks","Games","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","optimal control","power control","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncooperative energy-efficient power optimization algorithm","round-robin scheduling","optimal power control algorithm","distributed suboptimal subchannel allocation","fair time-averaged subchannel allocation metric","transmit power","closed-form best response","noncooperative game","joint subchannel allocation-power control","downlink OFDMA dense femtocell networks","interference mitigation","spectrum efficiency","low-complexity energy-efficient resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Femtocells have attracted growing attentions in academia, industry, and standardization forums in recent years. However, most of existing works on femtocell networks are focused on spectrum efficiency and interference mitigation, energy efficiency aspect is neglected. In this paper, we investigate the maximization of energy efficiency of downlink OFDMA dense femtocell networks by efficient resource allocation. To decrease the complexity, joint subchannel allocation and power control are decomposed into two steps. Power control has been modeled as a non-cooperative game, a closed-form best response of transmit power is obtained. Considering fairness and low complexity, a fair time-averaged subchannel allocation metric have been derived out. Based on that, we propose a distributed suboptimal subchannel allocation and optimal power control algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a low complexity with slight loss of energy efficiency compared with Round-Robin Scheduling and a noncooperative energy-efficient power optimization algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666407","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666407.pdf","startPage":"1650","endPage":"1654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity energy-efficient resource allocation in down-link dense femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666407/","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity energy-efficient resource allocation in down-link dense femtocell networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916168","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666407/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity energy-efficient resource allocation in down-link dense femtocell networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1650zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065518S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666408,"authors":[{"name":"L.

We show that the optimal EE is obtained by first allocating each subcarrier to the user equipment (UE) with the best channel power gain and then adapting the transmit power for each subcarrier using water-filling (WF) policy. Moreover, we propose a fast algorithm with linear complexity to compute the optimal WF level. We perform simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and investigate the impact of maximum transmit power on the optimal EE.

The goal of the cooperative decentralized scheme is to make a more efficient use of common wireless resources, selecting convenient TDD-frame configurations to maximize a sum utility function that takes into account both individual traffic demands and actual interference coupling situations. The cooperative decentralized scheme for UL/DL adaptation can be executed locally at each Base Station (BS), and relies solely on the exchange of low-rate signaling information among neighboring cells. Based on observed performance improvements, we conclude that cooperative decentralized schemes are a viable option for flexible-TDD implementation in SCN environments, particularly in presence of cells with strong interference coupling and low-rate signaling capabilities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A decentralized cooperative Uplink/Downlink adaptation scheme for TDD Small Cell Networks","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666413","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666413.pdf","startPage":"1682","endPage":"1687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A decentralized cooperative Uplink/Downlink adaptation scheme for TDD Small Cell Networks","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666413/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902310","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A decentralized cooperative Uplink/Downlink adaptation scheme for TDD Small Cell Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1682dowhuszko.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05799S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6666414,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio De Domenico","affiliation":["CEA, MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"De Domenico","id":"37601339800"},{"name":"Valentin Savin","affiliation":["CEA, MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Savin","id":"37605871100"},{"name":"Dimitri Ktenas","affiliation":["CEA, MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Ktenas","id":"37299039000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666414","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":665},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Interference","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Radio access networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","heuristic programming","interference suppression","mobility management (mobile radio)","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless backhaul-aware cell selection algorithm","heterogeneous cellular network","macrocell","intercell interference mitigation","ubiquitous broadband wireless service","heterogeneous access node","backhaul resource utilization","radio resource utilization management","load congestion avoidance","Evolve heuristic algorithm","SINR based association scheme"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers heterogeneous cellular networks, where cluster of small cells are deployed to create local hot spots inside the macro cell. In the past, most of the research in this topic has focused on mitigating inter cell interference; however, wireless backhaul has recently emerged as an urgent challenge to enable ubiquitous broadband wireless services at small cells. Hence, we propose a novel cell selection framework, which associates users and heterogeneous access nodes to improve the efficiency in the overall radio and backhaul resource utilization and avoid load congestions. We also model the relationships amongst cell load, resource management, backhaul capacity constraints, and the overall network capacity. Then, we describe the cell selection problem and we present a heuristic algorithm, named as Evolve, to solve it with limited complexity. Our analysis shows that Evolve achieves near optimal performance leading to notable capacity improvements with respect to the classic SINR based association scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A backhaul-aware cell selection algorithm for heterogeneous cellular networks","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666414","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666414.pdf","startPage":"1688","endPage":"1693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A backhaul-aware cell selection algorithm for heterogeneous cellular networks","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666414/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916150","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A backhaul-aware cell selection algorithm for heterogeneous cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1688dedomenico.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072327S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666415,"authors":[{"name":"Baoang Jiang","affiliation":["State Key laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.R.

Cross-tier interference to signal budget (CISB) is derived to characterize the tolerance of cross-tier interference for given per-tier downlink signal to interference ratio (SIR) targets and outage probability constraints. Network load is defined to show how the two-tier network is affected by parameters of the femto tier. Based on the analysis of CISRs and network load, the maximum density of simultaneously transmitting co-channel femtocells, tight upper and lower bounds of transmission power of femtocells for guaranteeing reliable macro and femto coverage in the two-tier network are obtained. A decentralized FAP regulation strategy which aims to maximize the number of co-channel transmitting femtocells under consideration of guaranteeing reliable macro and femto coverage is proposed. Simulation results verify our theoretical claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed femto regulation scheme in terms of spatial reuse efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666415.pdf","startPage":"1694","endPage":"1699","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On cross-tier interference in co-channel deployed two-tier macro and femto networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Interference","Frequency modulation","Reliability","Noise measurement","Shadow mapping","Ultrafast electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","femtocellular radio","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["co-channel deployed two-tier macrocellular network","femtocellular networks","cross-tier interference-to-signal ratio","CISR","cross-tier interference-to-signal budget","CISB","per-tier downlink signal-to-interference ratio","SIR targets","outage probability constraints","network load","lower bounds","upper bounds","decentralized FAP regulation strategy","femto regulation scheme","spatial reuse efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"On cross-tier interference in co-channel deployed two-tier macro and femto networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666415/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916170","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On cross-tier interference in co-channel deployed two-tier macro and femto networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1694baoang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072368S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666417,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085487467"},{"name":"Min Sheng","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37410574200"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085701552"},{"name":"Hailong Jiang","affiliation":["State Key Lab of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086788801"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666417","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Throughput","Downlink","Quality of service","Handover"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","heuristic programming","integer programming","interference suppression","nonlinear programming","scheduling","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["macro-femtocell-WiFi HetNets","interference management","heterogeneous cellular networks","interference mitigation via traffic offloading","mixed integer nonlinear programming","two-step heuristic algorithm","first self-scheduling step","physical resource blocks","home user equipment","HUE","data services","IM-Torch scheme"]}],"abstract":"Interference management is a hot issue in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets), which is very crucial for the performance promotion in heterogeneous cellular networks with full frequency reuse. Focusing on mitigating the interference between Macrocell and Femtocell, we propose the IM-Torch (Interference Mitigation via Traffic Offloading in Macro/Femtocell + WiFi Heterogeneous Networks) scheme to handle this problem via traffic offloading. We formulate it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program which is hard to solve, and design a two-step heuristic algorithm to solve this problem. In the first self-scheduling step, Femtocell tries to reallocate the power and PRBs (Physical Resource Blocks) for HUEs (Home User Equipment) to mitigate the interference. After the failure of the first step, Femtocell offloads some necessary HUEs with data services to WiFi and re-adjusts the resources for HUEs to alleviate the interference. The analysis and simulations validate that IM-Torch scheme can greatly alleviate the interference in HetNets and thus improve the system total throughput of Femtocell while guarantee the QoS of Macrocell and HUEs with real time applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IM-Torch: Interference Mitigation via Traffic Offloading in Macro/Femtocell+WiFi HetNets","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666417","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666417.pdf","startPage":"1705","endPage":"1709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"IM-Torch: Interference Mitigation via Traffic Offloading in Macro/Femtocell+WiFi HetNets","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666417/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902068","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IM-Torch: Interference Mitigation via Traffic Offloading in Macro/Femtocell+WiFi HetNets","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1705wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084504S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666425,"authors":[{"name":"Su Min Kim","affiliation":["ACCESS Linneaus Centre, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Su Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086646052"},{"name":"Mats Bengtsson","affiliation":["ACCESS Linneaus Centre, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Bengtsson","id":"37266300700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666425","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":471},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Vectors","High definition video","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","interference suppression","multiplexing","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual full-duplex buffer-aided relaying-relay selection","FD","half-duplex multiplexing loss","HD","multiple antenna","opportunistic relay selection","interrelay interference cancellation","self-interference","zero-forcing beamforming scheme","ZFB scheme","average end-to-end capacity","IRI cancellation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study virtual full-duplex (FD) buffer-aided relaying to recover the multiplexing loss of half-duplex (HD) relaying in a network with multiple buffer-aided relays, each of which has multiple antennas, through opportunistic relay selection and beamforming. The main idea of virtual FD buffer-aided relaying is that a source and a relay simultaneously transmit their own information to another relay and a destination, respectively. In this network, inter-relay interference (IRI) is a crucial problem which has to be resolved like self-interference in the FD relaying. In contrast to previous work that neglected the IRI, we propose two buffer-aided relay selection and beam-forming schemes taking the IRI into consideration. Numerical results show that our proposed relay selection scheme with zero-forcing beamforming (ZFB)-based IRI cancellation approaches the average end-to-end capacity of IRI-free upper bound as the numbers of relays and antennas increase.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666425","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666425.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666425","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"1748","endPage":"1752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual full-duplex buffer-aided relaying \u2014 Relay selection and beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Virtual full-duplex buffer-aided relaying \u2014 Relay selection and beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666425/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666425/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901798","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual full-duplex buffer-aided relaying \u2014 Relay selection and beamforming","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1748kim.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.132586S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666433,"authors":[{"name":"Bei Yang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086676205"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37291355100"},{"name":"Wenjun Xu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404292300"},{"name":"Yingpei Huang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yingpei","lastName":"Huang","id":"38548563600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666433","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Scheduling algorithms","Resource management","Uplink","Measurement","Scheduling","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","modulation coding","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proportional fair scheduling algorithm","LTE uplink","single-user MIMO transmission","single carrier property restriction","Long Term Evolution-uplink","control signaling delay","scheduling decisions","intercell interference variation","adaptive modulation and coding","AMC","resource allocation","single-carrier frequency division multiple access system","SC-FDMA system","ICI variation","intercell measurements","frequency domain packet scheduling problem","FDPS","PF scheduling algorithm","system level performance","cell user average spectral efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Long term evolution","SU-MIMO","Proportional fair scheduling","SC-FDMA","Adaptive modulation and coding"]}],"abstract":"Scheduling with single carrier property restriction has a significant impact on system performance in Long Term Evolution (LTE) uplink (UL). Due to the unavoidable delay of control signaling, the scheduling decisions have great influence on the variation of inter-cell interference (ICI) which affects the performance of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). Many studies have been carried out on the topic of resource allocation in single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) system. Some of them deal with the ICI variation with inter-cell measurements or coordination. In this paper, we present the problem of frequency domain packet scheduling (FDPS), analyze the negative effects of ICI variation and develop our improved proportional fair (PF) scheduling algorithm based on the traditional one for LTE UL. Our proposed algorithm decreases the ICI variation and improves AMC accuracy without any inter-cell coordination. Compared with the traditional way, system level performance shows that at least 29% gain can be obtained at both the cell user average spectral efficiency and the cell edge user spectral efficiency with comparable proportional fairness in typical interference-limited scenario.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666433","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666433.pdf","startPage":"1789","endPage":"1793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved proportional fair scheduling algorithm in LTE uplink with single-user MIMO transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666433/","displayDocTitle":"Improved proportional fair scheduling algorithm in LTE uplink with single-user MIMO transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902001","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666433/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved proportional fair scheduling algorithm in LTE uplink with single-user MIMO transmission","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1789yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145741S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6666437,"authors":[{"name":"Lung-Han Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lung-Han","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37086728227"},{"name":"Hsi-Lu Chao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsi-Lu","lastName":"Chao","id":"37273526900"},{"name":"Chia-Lung Liu","affiliation":["Information & Communications Research Labs, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Lung","lastName":"Liu","id":"37858953200"},{"name":"Kuei-Li Huang","affiliation":["Information & Communications Research Labs, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuei-Li","lastName":"Huang","id":"37074633600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666437","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Resource management","Robustness","Clustering algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Uplink","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","heuristic programming","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","modulation coding","optimisation","radio equipment","radio links","resource allocation","scheduling","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO UL scheduling","LTE-Advanced uplink spectral efficiency system","multimedia content","MU-MIMO technology","clustered SC-FDMA technology","uplink multiple access scheme","user equipment","UE","RB","modulation scheme","coding scheme","robust rate constraint","optimization","NP-hard problem","low-complexity heuristic algorithm","resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE-A","clutered SC-FDMA","MU-MIMO","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Due to the facts of wireless data usage being increasing faster now than ever before and more multimedia content being generated by users and uploaded to the network, multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) technology would be crucial to improve the LTE-A uplink spectral efficiency for meeting the service demands. On the other side, adopting clustered SC-FDMA technology as the uplink multiple access scheme of LTE-A means that a User Equipment (UE) can be allocated more than one cluster which consists of contiguous RBs (this is the contiguity constraint). Moreover, all allocated RBs to a UE must use the same modulation and coding scheme (this is the robust rate constraint). The two constraints make MU-MIMO UL scheduling more complicated. In this paper, we formulate the MU-MIMO UL scheduling problem with taking two constraints into consideration. Since this optimization had been proven to be an NP-hard problem, we further develop two low-complexity heuristic algorithms. We demonstrate that competitive performance can be achieved in terms of system throughput and fairness index.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user MIMO scheduling in LTE-advanced uplink systems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666437","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666437.pdf","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user MIMO scheduling in LTE-advanced uplink systems","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666437/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901795","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user MIMO scheduling in LTE-advanced uplink systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1811hsu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063669S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666439,"authors":[{"name":"Munam Ali Shah","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Munam Ali","lastName":"Shah","id":"37958939300"},{"name":"Sijing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Sijing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38238864500"},{"name":"Carsten Maple","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Maple","id":"37266998800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666439","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Data communication","Reliability","Switches","Cognitive radio","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","cooperative communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control channel etiquettes","cognitive radio networks","CR network","spectrum scarcity","common control channel","free channel list","FCL","cooperative communication","CR nodes","CR MAC protocol","rapid channel access","reliable channel access","backup control channel","PU claim","simulation modelling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","common control channel","cooperative communication","MAC protocols"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control channel etiquettes: Implementation and evaluation of a hybrid approach for cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","endPage":"1828","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666439.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666439","startPage":"1823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666439","abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) has emerged as the promising technology to address spectrum scarcity issues.

The protocol consists of two levels of selection: rapid channel accessing and reliable channel accessing. In rapid channel accessing, nodes quickly and efficiently converge to a newly found control channel. In reliable channel accessing, switching to the backup control channel is performed whenever there is a PU claim on licensed channel. Furthermore, our reliable channel accessing allows CR nodes to access more than one control channel simultaneously. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach through simulation modelling. The results show that our protocol can achieve efficient channel access time and fairness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13901779","htmlLink":"/document/6666439/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Control channel etiquettes: Implementation and evaluation of a hybrid approach for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control channel etiquettes: Implementation and evaluation of a hybrid approach for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1823shah.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120181S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666441,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Jun Lee","affiliation":["School of Electronics Telecommunications and Computer Engineering, Korea Aerospace University, Goyang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Jun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37599974400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666441","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Signal to noise ratio","Data communication","Throughput","Adaptive systems","Data collection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backward induction approach","secondary users","cognitive radio networks","random access","adaptive cooperative spectrum sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backward induction","cognitive radio","cooperative spectrum sensing","random access","RTS/CTS"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new adaptive cooperative spectrum sensing scheme using random access is proposed in a cognitive radio network. Cooperative spectrum sensing improves spectrum sensing performance considerably. In typical cooperative spectrum sensing situations, spectrum sensing data of several secondary users are collected before sensing decision. Yet how to collect the sensing data is not an easy problem because coordination between secondary users is needed. This study addresses this problem. The proposed scheme uses random access to report the sensing data of the secondary users. In this scheme, it is necessary to determine the length of the sensing data collection period. In the proposed scheme, the length of the sensing data collection period is determined adaptively based on the current status of the collected sensing data. We apply backward induction approach to decide when to stop the collection procedure of the sensing data. The proposed scheme does not need complex slot management to collect sensing data and shows performance improvement over conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666441","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666441.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666441","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"1835","endPage":"1839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive cooperative spectrum sensing using random access in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666441","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive cooperative spectrum sensing using random access in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666441/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666441/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916142","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive cooperative spectrum sensing using random access in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1835lee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056905S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666442,"authors":[{"name":"Keyu Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Keyu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085439851"},{"name":"Fangjian Han","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Fangjian","lastName":"Han","id":"38239497100"},{"name":"Fangjing Han","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Fangjing","lastName":"Han","id":"38239496900"},{"name":"Dekai Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Dekai","lastName":"Kong","id":"37086747408"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666442","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666442","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Cognitive radio","Finite element analysis","Systematics","Synchronization","Classification algorithms","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rendezvous sequence construction","cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","dynamic spectrum access","DSA scene","channel hopping sequence designing problem","blind rendezvous","asymmetric asynchronous channel hopping system","AACH system","difference set-based sequences","performance simulation","low primary users activity case","high primary users activity case"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","blind rendezvous","channel hopping sequence","difference set"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666442","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666442.pdf","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rendezvous sequence construction in Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc networks based on difference sets","abstract":"Cognitive Radio networks have emerged as a promising paradigm to achieve dynamic spectrum access (DSA). However under DSA scene, the available channels of each user are usually different and change dynamically, which makes the rendezvous between radios sophisticated. This paper focuses on the channel hopping sequence designing problem for blind rendezvous using difference sets as a tool. I) First, we will show that any hopping sequence previously proposed under asymmetric asynchronous channel hopping (AACH) system is essentially difference set-based, if all users in system act as the same manner. II) Second, we will deduce a low boundary for the difference set-based sequences. III) Third, using the properties of difference sets, we will propose an efficient and systematic method to find difference sets that can be used to construct channel hopping sequences. IV) Finally, a performance simulation is discussed, which shows that the difference sets generated sequences outperform other algorithms, both under low primary users activity case and high primary users activity case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666442/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13901943","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666442/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rendezvous sequence construction in Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc networks based on difference sets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rendezvous sequence construction in Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc networks based on difference sets","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1840wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056097S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666448,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Nevertheless, existing delay and energy analyses of BCH decoders in the literature neither consider the channel statistics nor the first and second moments of the decoding delay. Therefore, they provide conservative codeword designs that lead to high delays and waste of energy.

In conventional power optimization algorithms, the Gaussian input distribution is assumed, which is unrealistic, whereas the Finite Symbol Alphabet (FSA) input distribution, (i.e., M-QAM) is more applicable to practical systems. In this paper, we consider the power optimization problem in multiple input multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing based CR systems given FSA inputs, and derive an optimal power allocation scheme by capitalizing on the relationship between mutual information and minimum mean square error. The proposed scheme is shown to save transmit power compared to its conventional counterpart. Furthermore, our proposed scheme achieves higher data rate compared to the Gaussian optimized power due to fewer number of subcarriers being nulled. The proposed optimal power algorithm is evaluated and compared with the conventional power allocation algorithms using Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results reveal that, for distances between the SU transmitter and the PU receiver ranging between 50m to 85m, the transmit power saving with the proposed algorithm is in the range 13-90%, whereas the rate gain is in the range 5-31% depending on the modulation scheme (i.e., BPSK, QPSK and 16-QAM) used.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666455","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation for MIMO-OFDM based Cognitive Radio systems with arbitrary input distributions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation for MIMO-OFDM based Cognitive Radio systems with arbitrary input distributions","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666455/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916129","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666455/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation for MIMO-OFDM based Cognitive Radio systems with arbitrary input distributions","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1909sohail.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077136S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666457,"authors":[{"name":"Xidong Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.R.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a distributed power self-optimization scheme for the downlink of dense femtocell networks. First, a non-cooperative power self-optimization game framework is established based on the exact potential game, which is demonstrated to converge to a pure and unique Nash Equilibrium. Then, a novel convex pricing mechanism is presented to price the transmit power of femtocells. Finally, combined with Firefly Intelligence Optimization (FIO), an effective power self-optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence is proposed to achieve the Nash Equilibrium. With practical LTE parameters and 3GPP dual-strip femtocell model, simulation results show that the proposed scheme dramatically reduce femtocells transmit power while improving the throughput of dense femtocell networks compared to the scheme with non-linear pricing.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666457","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666457.pdf","startPage":"1919","endPage":"1923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed power self-optimization with convex pricing in dense femtocell networks via an exact potential game","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666457/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power self-optimization with convex pricing in dense femtocell networks via an exact potential game","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902311","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666457/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power self-optimization with convex pricing in dense femtocell networks via an exact potential game","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1919wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056425S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666461,"authors":[{"name":"M.-T.

So far, most research has focused on the perfect synchronization case and for only two-nodes wireless relaying networks. Unfortunately, perfect synchronization is difficult (or impossible) to achieve in wireless relaying networks, as a timing misalignment between the received versions of the transmitted signals from the relaying nodes will occur. In this paper, an improved detection scheme, based on a PIC detector which was previously introduced, is proposed to mitigate the performance degradation due to imperfect synchronization in four-nodes wireless relaying networks employing CL-EO-STBC. Numerical simulations show that the proposed detection scheme can achieve performance close to that of perfect synchronization even under severe imperfect synchronization conditions in just two iterations while maintaining a low-level of computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666461","startPage":"1941","endPage":"1945","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666461.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Closed-Loop Extended Orthogonal STBC: Improved performance in imperfect synchronization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Closed-Loop Extended Orthogonal STBC: Improved performance in imperfect synchronization","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666461/","accessionNumber":"13902035","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666461/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Closed-Loop Extended Orthogonal STBC: Improved performance in imperfect synchronization","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p1941elastal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045798S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6666462,"authors":[{"name":"Valeria Loscr\u00ed","affiliation":["DIMES - Department of Informatics, University of Calabria, Cosenza, ITALY"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Loscr\u00ed","id":"37422641700"},{"name":"Pasquale Pace","affiliation":["DIMES - Department of Informatics, University of Calabria, Cosenza, ITALY"],"firstName":"Pasquale","lastName":"Pace","id":"37279142900"},{"name":"Rosario Surace","affiliation":["DIMES - Department of Informatics, University of Calabria, Cosenza, ITALY"],"firstName":"Rosario","lastName":"Surace","id":"38232662600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666462","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666462","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Quality of service","Neurons","Genetic algorithms","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","modulation","neural nets","software radio","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective evolving neural network","SDR modulation management","distributed neural-genetic algorithm","fixed-mobile wireless nodes","software defined radio","application level constraints","disaster recovery","controlled mobility paradigm","wireless devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self-Organizing Networks","SDR","Controlled Mobility","Neural Network","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666462","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666462.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"1946","endPage":"1951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective evolving neural network supporting SDR modulations management","abstract":"This paper proposes a distributed Neural/Genetic algorithm able to compute both the more suitable positioning and transmission modulation schemes for fixed/mobile wireless nodes equipped with software defined radio abilities.

The synergistic combination of controlled mobility and SDR in a totally distributed way, allows to obtain a high degree of self-configurability; moreover, the extreme adaptability to the network conditions and application level constraints in terms of coverage and guaranteed connectivity, make the proposed approach well suited for quite different communication scenarios such as classical monitoring or disaster recovery.

However, the technique does not consider peak to average power ratio (PAPR), where the PAPR must be kept as low as possible to use a low cost power amplifier (PA) at relay node (RN). PAPR reduction technique should be applied in RN, because lower PAPR in source node (SN) using PAPR reduction technique might not be maintained in RN owing to channel effects between SN and RN. We propose a new approach of BTW SCP technique, S-BTW (shifted BTW) that can perform a low PAPR as well as good BER performance. After BTW reordering, we calculate PAPR and compare the value with a threshold value. If the PAPR cannot achieve the required PAPR value, the subcarrier is one-by-one circularly shifted until reaching a maximum number of shifts. For the case that the required PAPR cannot be achieved after reaching maximum number of shifts, we propose a combination of the S-BTW and clipping. Both simulation and theoretical analysis is performed to prove the validity of our proposal.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666473","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666473.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2005","endPage":"2010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction of amplify-and-forward relay OFDM system using subcarrier pairing method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction of amplify-and-forward relay OFDM system using subcarrier pairing method","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666473/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901971","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666473/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction of amplify-and-forward relay OFDM system using subcarrier pairing method","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2005harum.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053383S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666474,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Khalil Sileh","affiliation":["University of Tikrit, Iraq"],"firstName":"Ibrahim Khalil","lastName":"Sileh","id":"38232978100"},{"name":"Wei Xiang","affiliation":["University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37396484300"},{"name":"Andrew Maxwell","affiliation":["University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Maxwell","id":"37086554018"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666474","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Resource management","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Conferences","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","decode and forward communication","OFDM modulation","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["substantial enhancement","ADF scheme","adaptive decode-and-forward scheme","threshold value","instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio","AF scheme","amplify-and-forward scheme","MC-AHRP","selective multicarrier-adaptive hybrid relay protocol","frequency-selective channel","OFDM-based hybrid relay protocol","subcarrier permutation","resource allocation","broadband communication","spectral efficiency","multipath fading mitigation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","joint subcarrier pairing-resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-AHRP","OFDM","resource allocation","subcarrier permutation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been adopted as a promising technique to mitigate multi-path fading and provides high spectral efficiency in broadband communications.

Among these challenges, femtocell pilot management is particularly important due to its potential impact on both femtocell and macrocell users. Femtocell pilots determine femtocell coverage, but must be designed with consideration for macrocell transmissions and users. We introduce a utility-based femtocell pilot management algorithm that sets femtocell pilots by finding the Nash equilibrium of an N-player strategic game, using a utility function derived from the femtocell coverage radius. Using simulations, we find that the game-theoretic interference management algorithm reduces outage probabilities relative to a naive interference management scheme by up to 43% in the open access femtocell case, and 17% in the closed access femtocell case. Our conclusion is that game theory can be applied to the distributed problem of femtocell pilot estimation, with good results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666481.pdf","startPage":"2051","endPage":"2056","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility-based femtocell pilot management","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Games","Interference","Nash equilibrium","Heuristic algorithms","Estimation","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","game theory","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enterprise femtocell deployments","network operators","public users","private users","femtocell users","macrocell users","macrocell transmissions","femtocell coverage","utility-based femtocell pilot management algorithm","femtocell pilots","Nash equilibrium","N-player strategic game","game-theoretic algorithm","outage probabilities reduction","naive interference management scheme","open access femtocell case","closed access femtocell case","distributed problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless networks","3G mobile communication","Packet radio networks","Microeconomics","Interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Utility-based femtocell pilot management","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666481/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901898","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility-based femtocell pilot management","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2051lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057345S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666509,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandr M.

The algorithm is based on a direct traffic balancing between macro and small cells assuming that the macro cell periodically informs all other cells in its coverage area on its load using some adaptation performance metric. Then, each small cell can compare its own adaptation metric with the macro's and decide if it could accept or release some users by means of updating its own range expansion parameter. To study such a decentralized adaptation algorithm we introduce a semi-analytic approach (analytic for the given signal-interference scenario) based on the theory of absorbing Markov chains. It allows us to study convergence properties of the algorithm such as convergence probability, convergence rate, effects of selection of algorithm parameters and adaptation metrics, probability of non-convergence (ping-pong) and possible ways of its recovery. The semi-analytic study is illustrated in a dual carrier network configuration with a dedicated carrier for small cells.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666509.pdf","startPage":"2203","endPage":"2207","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized adaptive range expansion in heterogeneous WCDMA networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Throughput","Measurement","Markov processes","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","Markov processes","probability","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized adaptive range expansion","macrocell coverage","WCDMA heterogeneous network","direct traffic balancing","semianalytic approach","signal-interference scenario","absorbing Markov chain theory","convergence probability","carrier network configuration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HetNet","range expansion","biased handover","decentralized adaptation","absorbing Markov chain","ping-pong"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized adaptive range expansion in heterogeneous WCDMA networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666509/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902301","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized adaptive range expansion in heterogeneous WCDMA networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2203kuzminskiy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048738S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6666513,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Bazzi","affiliation":["CNR-IEIIT, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Bazzi","id":"37552991200"},{"name":"Barbara M.

However, due to the high variability in time and position of nodes, the medium access control layer of IEEE 802.11p, which is based on carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), could lead to severe performance degradation in terms of delivery delay and delivery ratio as the node density increases. Because of its higher efficiency, we propose the use of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) as access technique in VANETs, discussing and evaluating i) its feasibility, ii) the challenges posed by the distributed allocation of resources, and iii) its performance in terms of resource allocation efficiency (specifically, delivery rate and delivery delay) when compared to CSMA/CA. Results, obtained by means of simulations that jointly take into account realistic road maps, vehicular traffic, and the whole network architecture from the application down to the physical layer, show that OFDMA allows up to four times higher delivery rate and that it also guarantees lower delivery delay in heavy loaded network conditions.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666513","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666513.pdf","startPage":"2223","endPage":"2228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of OFDMA for next generation vehicular ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666513/","displayDocTitle":"On the use of OFDMA for next generation vehicular ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902027","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666513/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of OFDMA for next generation vehicular ad hoc networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2223bazzi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.12025S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666527,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In the system model under consideration, a primary service provider (PSP) can sell its available spectrum bandwidth to a secondary service provider (SSP). In contrast to the conventional schemes, the SUs served by the SSP can also share the unsold bands of the PSP through the approach of opportunistic spectrum access (OSA), which will introduce interference to the PUs and make the PSP suffer a profit loss due to the sensing imperfections in practical networks. Based on microeconomic theory, this problem of bandwidth allocation is formulated as a market model, and an equilibrium where both the PSP and SSP are satisfied with the amount of allocated bandwidth and the price is derived by using the concept of demand and supply functions. Moreover, an iterative algorithm for distributed implementation of our scheme is also proposed. Furthermore, simulation results and comparisons are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666530","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666530.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666530","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"2312","endPage":"2316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical spectrum sharing for cognitive radio networks based on microeconomic theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical spectrum sharing for cognitive radio networks based on microeconomic theory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666530/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666530/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902159","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical spectrum sharing for cognitive radio networks based on microeconomic theory","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2312yu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096631S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666533,"authors":[{"name":"Eirini Karapistoli","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Eirini","lastName":"Karapistoli","id":"37564622500"},{"name":"Anastasios A.

UWB is a key solution for wireless connectivity characterized by ultra low power consumption, and high precision ranging. Based on these principles, we propose a novel anomaly detection and localization algorithm for cluster-based UWB wireless sensor networks. Towards securing the cluster formation protocol, we also define a novel, trust-aware leader election metric. The performance of the proposed algorithm in identifying intrusions using a rule-based detection technique is studied via simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666533/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13901960","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666533/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection and localization in UWB wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection and localization in UWB wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2326karapistoli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04946S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6666538,"authors":[{"name":"Antoine Bagula","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Bagula","id":"37269446300"},{"name":"Djamel Djenouri","affiliation":["CERIST Research Center, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Djamel","lastName":"Djenouri","id":"37266429100"},{"name":"Elmouatezbillah Karbab","affiliation":["CERIST Research Center, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Elmouatezbillah","lastName":"Karbab","id":"37086743530"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666538","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Interference","Logic gates","Routing protocols","Energy consumption","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","power consumption","radiofrequency interference","routing protocols","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TOB","TinyOS beaconing","power consumption","collection protocols","LIBP","least interference beaconing protocol","LIBA","least interference beaconing algorithm","nodes traffic flow interference","local optimization problem","routing simplicity","traffic engineering","IoT","Internet-of-the-Things","USN","ubiquitous sensor network management"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666538","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666538.pdf","startPage":"2352","endPage":"2356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ubiquitous sensor network management: The least interference beaconing model","abstract":"Network management is revisited in the emerging ubiquitous sensor networks (USNs) that form the Internet-of-the-Things (IoT) with the objective of evaluating the impact of traffic engineering on energy efficiency and assessing if routing simplicity translates into scalability. USN management is formulated as a local optimization problem minimizing the number of traffic flows transiting by a node: the nodes traffic flow interference with other nodes. The least interference beaconing algorithm (LIBA) is proposed as an algorithmic solution to the problem, and the least interference beaconing protocol (LIBP) as its protocol implementation. LIBP extends the beaconing process widely used by collection protocols with load balancing to improve the USN energy efficiency. Simulation results reveal the relative efficiency of the resulting traffic engineering scheme compared to state of the art protocols. These results show up to 30% reduction in power consumption compared to TinyOS beaconing (TOB), and up to 40% compared to collection tree protocol (CTP) while sustaining better performance in terms of scalability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666538/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13916176","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666538/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ubiquitous sensor network management: The least interference beaconing model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ubiquitous sensor network management: The least interference beaconing model","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2352bagula.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040404S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6666540,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Zhang","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Technology, University of Agder (UiA), Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086673804"},{"name":"Lei Jiao","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Technology, University of Agder (UiA), Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37401908300"},{"name":"Ole-Christoffer Granmo","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Technology, University of Agder (UiA), Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Ole-Christoffer","lastName":"Granmo","id":"37295135700"},{"name":"B.

The problem consists of allocating a channel which, at any given time instant is not being used by a PU, to a Secondary User (SU). Within our study, we assume that a SU is allowed to perform \u201cchannel switching\u201d, i.e., to choose an alternate channel S times (where S +1 \u2264 N) if the previous choice does not lead to a channel which is vacant. The paper first presents a formal probabilistic model for the problem itself, referred to as the Formal Secondary Channel Selection (FSCS) problem, and the characteristics of the FSCS are then analyzed. Thereafter, the paper proposes a fascinating solution to the FSCS problem by invoking the recently devised Bayesian Learning Automaton (BLA). The crucial advantage of the BLA is that unlike traditional Learning Automata (LA), it does not involve an action probability vector, but rather relies on \u201csampling\u201d as per the a posteriori Bayesian estimates of the channel occupation probabilities. However, rather than utilize the BLA in the form that was earlier proposed, we shall extend it to the so-called Switchable Bayesian Learning Automaton (SBLA), which, indeed, attains the optimal solution in the overall composite action space. Apart from proposing the solution, the paper also contains detailed simulation results which demonstrate the power of the solution proposed.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666540","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666540.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666540","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"2362","endPage":"2367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel selection in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Switchable Bayesian Learning Automata approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666540","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Channel selection in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Switchable Bayesian Learning Automata approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666540/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666540/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902241","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel selection in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Switchable Bayesian Learning Automata approach","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2362zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088905S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666541,"authors":[{"name":"Edwin Mugume","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Mugume","id":"37085458056"},{"name":"Warit Prawatmuang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Warit","lastName":"Prawatmuang","id":"38262243100"},{"name":"Daniel K.

Femtocells have been proposed as a solution to enhance network capacity without significantly increasing energy consumption and associated network deployment costs. In this paper, we analyze the network capacity and energy consumption aspects of a joint macrocell and femtocell network based on the LTE standard. Femtocells and macrocells are operated in the same frequency band to enhance spectral efficiency. Femtocell users are secondary users who only access the channel opportunistically when macrocell users are idle. We propose the use of cooperative spectrum sensing to manage adverse interference emanating from the co-channel operation of both macrocells and femtocells. Simulation results show that cooperative sensing is very effective at managing this cross-tier interference to maximize the throughput of both the macrocell and femtocell layers. This throughput maximization allows the lowest energy consumption ratio of such a heterogeneous network.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666541","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666541.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2368","endPage":"2372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing for green cognitive femtocell network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing for green cognitive femtocell network","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666541/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916154","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666541/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum sensing for green cognitive femtocell network","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2368mugume.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079559S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666542,"authors":[{"name":"Anum L.

Contrary to most of the previously published related works on spectrum adaptation in CRNs, in this paper both call buffering and unencumbered service time with non-exponential probability distribution are considered. To reduce the negative impact of the interruption of ongoing calls of secondary users (SUs) due to the arrival of primary users (PUs) on the quality of service and to exploit the delay tolerance of elastic traffic, call buffering is employed. Although in cognitive radio networks with elastic traffic and spectrum adaptation there is a tradeoff among blocking/interruption probability and transmission delay, transmission delay has been not previously evaluated as performance metric in these systems. The developed mathematical model additionally considers both impatient time and non-homogeneous bandwidth requirement (i.e., different number of channels utilized) for PUs and SUs. System performance is evaluated in terms of new call and forced call termination probabilities, throughput, and transmission delay. Different probability distributions of the unencumbered service time are considered.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666542","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666542.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666542","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"2373","endPage":"2377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of spectrum adaptation in cognitive radio networks with elastic traffic and buffering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of spectrum adaptation in cognitive radio networks with elastic traffic and buffering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666542/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666542/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902214","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of spectrum adaptation in cognitive radio networks with elastic traffic and buffering","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2373corralruiz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066452S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666543,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Thakur","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Thakur","id":"37072931400"},{"name":"Sudeepta Mishra","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India"],"firstName":"Sudeepta","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37085378712"},{"name":"C.

Cell biasing attempts to offload users from macrocell by modifying cell selection criteria. This is done by adding a positive bias to the measured signal from femtocells before performing cell selection. While the macrocell offloaded users may experience lower signal quality from femtocells, they are benefited by receiving higher bandwidth. From users' point of view, it is desirable that user equipments receive highest possible bitrate from the target base station. However, cell biasing only considers received signal strength to make cell selection decisions. The bitrate received at a user equipment is directly proportional to available bandwidth and user load at target base station. In this paper, we propose an enhanced cell selection scheme that considers scheduling opportunities available at femtocell by analyzing the current load and femtocell specific constraints such as maximum user count and minimum signal strength. Obtained results show that our work provides the best performance in terms of both system throughput and energy efficiency among all compared cell selection schemes.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666543","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666543.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2378","endPage":"2382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A load-conscious cell selection scheme for femto-assisted cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A load-conscious cell selection scheme for femto-assisted cellular networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666543/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901902","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666543/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A load-conscious cell selection scheme for femto-assisted cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2378thakur.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090768S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666544,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Peng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Peng","id":"38547979500"},{"name":"Chunjing Hu","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Chunjing","lastName":"Hu","id":"37634958800"},{"name":"Tao Peng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Peng","id":"37288452400"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086215225"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666544","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":859},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Interference","Quality of service","Signal to noise ratio","Convex functions","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","convex programming","frequency division multiple access","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS protection","OFDMA-based system","resource allocation scheme","device-to-device multicast group","quality of service","cellular user","signal-to-interference-pulse noise ratio","CeUE","D2D multicast group","subcarrier assignment","power allocation","Shannon capacity","convex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Device-to-Device(D2D) Multicast","Resource Allocation","Fairness","QoS"]}],"abstract":"A resource allocation scheme involving several Device-to-Device (D2D) multicast groups underlaying OFDMA-based systems is proposed in this paper. In order to guarantee Quality of service (QoS) of cellular users (CeUEs), we define the signal-to-interference-pulse noise ratio (SINR) threshold value for CeUEs. Meanwhile, the minimum throughput of a single D2D multicast group is predetermined to maintain fairness of each D2D multicast group. Since the subcarrier assignment and power allocation are a joint optimization problem with complex calculation, the proposed scheme is divided into two steps. First, subcarriers are allocated under the premise of ensuring the minimum throughput of the D2D multicast groups and the QoS of CeUEs. Then by applying an approximation form of Shannon capacity, the power allocation problem can be solved by convex optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves sum-throughput significantly as well as fairness. Besides, the sum-throughput increases with the increasing number of D2D multicast groups.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666544","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666544.pdf","startPage":"12383","endPage":"2387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A resource allocation scheme for D2D multicast with QoS protection in OFDMA-based systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666544/","displayDocTitle":"A resource allocation scheme for D2D multicast with QoS protection in OFDMA-based systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902169","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666544/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A resource allocation scheme for D2D multicast with QoS protection in OFDMA-based systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2383peng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058299S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666545,"authors":[{"name":"Ergin Dinc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ko\u00e7 University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ergin","lastName":"Dinc","id":"37085354783"},{"name":"Mutlu Koca","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Boazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mutlu","lastName":"Koca","id":"37296264100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666545","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Base stations","Geometry","Availability","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","probability","stochastic processes","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic fractional frequency reuse method","OFDMA cellular networks","D-FFR scheme","cell-edge frequency","neighboring cells","subband sharing flexibility","soft frequency reuse","SFR","cell-edge signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio","SINR","outage probability","network sum rate throughput","coverage probability","stochastic geometry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic resource allocation","Fractional frequency reuse (FFR)","Rate","Sum Rate","Coverage Probability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a dynamic fractional frequency reuse (D-FFR) scheme for OFDMA based cellular networks. The proposed approach is extended from the so-called strict FFR architecture by allowing a fraction of the cell-edge frequencies to be shared by the edge users of the neighboring cells. This sub-band sharing flexibility not only alleviates the spectral deficiency of the strict FFR against soft frequency reuse (SFR) but also improves the already superior performance metrics such as the cell-edge signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio (SINR), outage probability and network sum rate throughput. It also provides robustness against sudden and uneven bursts of traffic in one of the cells of the networks. To this end, we provide an analytical framework to determine the coverage probability and the achievable rate of the proposed D-FFR scheme using the parametric models based on stochastic geometry and illustrate the benefits over static (strict or soft) frequency reuse methods via simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666545","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666545.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2388","endPage":"2392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On dynamic fractional frequency reuse for OFDMA cellular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On dynamic fractional frequency reuse for OFDMA cellular networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666545/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902269","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666545/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On dynamic fractional frequency reuse for OFDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2388dinc.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041351S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6666551,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo M.

By integrating in its architecture novel dynamic spectrum access algorithms, the CRAHN is expected to increase usage efficiency of available spectrum resources. However, the performance of such algorithms, distributed and cooperative in its nature, is tightly coupled with the existence of a signaling layer, or common control channel (CCC), that is established between neighboring Cognitive Radios (CRs). In this paper we propose a Distributed Consensus Algorithm to address the problem of distributed CCC allocation in CRAHNs. The proposed solution defines a token ring architecture for the CCC and introduces an additional feature, the token-embedded pilot-tone, used by the consensus algorithm to derive a channel quality metric. Through a simulation study of the Distributed Consensus Algorithm, we evaluate its performance for different network scenarios; the results show a significant increase of network capacity and spectrum efficiency when compared to a sequence-based rendezvous scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13901845","htmlLink":"/document/6666551/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Self-organized common control channel design for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organized common control channel design for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2419dossantos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051772S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666552,"authors":[{"name":"Safa Essassi","affiliation":["Engineering school of Telecommunications of Tunis (Sup'Com), University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Safa","lastName":"Essassi","id":"38232962600"},{"name":"Sofiane Cherif","affiliation":["Engineering school of Telecommunications of Tunis (Sup'Com), University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sofiane","lastName":"Cherif","id":"37392577100"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["Engineering school of Telecommunications of Tunis (Sup'Com), University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666552","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666552","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RB allocation","genetic algorithm","X2 interface","LTE uplink","Long Term Evolution","cell-edge users","uplink intercell interference coordination","interference reduction","resource block allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC)","X2 interface","Genetic Algorithm (GA)","Resource Block (RB)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666552","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666552.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"2424","endPage":"2428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RB allocation based on genetic algorithm and coordination over the X<inf>2</inf> interface in the LTE uplink","abstract":"The universal frequency reuse has been targeted for the Long Term Evolution. It leads to a harmful inter-cell interference experienced notably by the cell-edge users. The uplink inter-cell interference coordination becomes among the most important challenges. Throughout literature, many techniques were proposed to overcome this issue. Among these techniques, the soft frequency reuse concept grasped many attentions. Certainly, it succeeded in reducing the interference for edge-cell users by prohibiting the allocation of the same RB to two users in adjacent cells-edge. However, it presents several drawbacks in terms of spectral efficiency and overloaded cell-edge users. The most proposed approaches are based on this scheme.

In this paper, we demonstrate a spread spectrum sliding correlator channel sounder operating at a center frequency of 73.5 GHz with an 800 MHz null-to-null bandwidth. The channel sounder provides a multipath time resolution of 2.33 ns. 72 GHz millimeter wave propagation and penetration characteristics in an indoor office environment are investigated using the sliding correlator channel sounding system. Data collected and processed from the measurements shows that strong received power can be achieved from the multipath-rich indoor environment, in the presence of multiple obstructions.

The problem can be transformed into a series of convex weighted sum rate problems and iteratively solved by standard solvers.

We propose an efficient algorithm that utilizes the convexity of the rate region to reduce number of iterations. It consists of power bisection and optimal user weights search. The algorithm avoids the full search for the optimal user weights. By continuously constructing a convex rate polyhedron, it determines the feasibility of the current rate target at a early phase and immediately goes to the power bisection without knowing the optimal user weights. The proposed algorithm is compared with the existing methods and is shown to be significantly more efficient than the existing methods in terms of computational complexities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast converging algorithm for sum power minimization in MIMO uplink","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666555","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666555.pdf","startPage":"2439","endPage":"2443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A fast converging algorithm for sum power minimization in MIMO uplink","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666555/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902281","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast converging algorithm for sum power minimization in MIMO uplink","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2439lu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057511S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6666556,"authors":[{"name":"Ashraf Awadelkarim Widaa Ahmed","affiliation":["Wireless@KTH, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ashraf Awadelkarim Widaa","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37086752192"},{"name":"Jan Markendahl","affiliation":["Wireless@KTH, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Markendahl","id":"37392305300"},{"name":"Cicek Cavdar","affiliation":["Wireless@KTH, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Cicek","lastName":"Cavdar","id":"37296713100"},{"name":"Amirhossein Ghanbari","affiliation":["Wireless@KTH, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Ghanbari","id":"37072926800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666556","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":294},"abstract":"The deployment of low cost and low power base stations has been recognized in recent years as a promising cost-efficient solution and energy-efficient strategy. In this paper the femtocell and macrocell deployment options have been compared in the context of indoor mobile broadband deployment, with focus on the effect of different backhauling solutions in power consumption and the total deployment cost. This study has been based on the deployment of mobile broadband services within an area of one square kilometers in a new densely populated business district where the different user demands, spectrum bandwidths, backhaul technologies and radio access technologies are taken into account. Moreover, various deployment scenarios reflecting the business perspectives of mobile operators have been looked into as well. The main findings reached indicate that backhaul solutions contribute differently to cost and power consumption depending on the employed deployment strategy. However, contributions to the total power consumption and to the CapEx and OpEx elements of the total deployment cost elements turned to be more significant in the case of femtocell deployment scenarios than in the case of macrocell ones. It is worthy of notice that the femtocell deployment is more cost-efficient, especially in high demand situation when new macro sites are needed to be deployed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE

spectrum sensing is widely known to collect sensing information from cooperative sensors to assist cognitive radio transmitter to better judge the transmission opportunities, with appearance of hidden primary system terminals. However, it is usually ignored that a successful transmission can go through by requiring not only the spectrum availability at cognitive radio transmitter, but also spectrum availability at cognitive radio receiver. Using this special observation, we use Poisson distributed nodes and Boolean random network model to analyze the geometric region allowing CR transmission with the help of cooperative sensors. Contrary to intuition, we find that cooperative sensing is not always helpful and the region allowing CR transmission is no longer circular anymore. Using this geometric property, we further find that transmission link can remain bidirectional only under certain geometric conditions. Due to these observations, we develop a complete methodology so that a secondary transmitter can select helpful cooperative sensors corresponding to different receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13902262","htmlLink":"/document/6666566/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Geometric design of cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric design of cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive radios","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2496hung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088057S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666568,"authors":[{"name":"Shang Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.

Different node allocation schemes will lead to the different sensing performance between the sub-bands that compose the wideband. If the detection accuracy of some sub-band is much low, the primary user (PU) will be interfered severely. Thus, the system fairness which is measured by the minimum sensing performance between the sub-bands is proposed. In order to guarantee wideband spectrum sensing fairness, in this paper, we investigate node allocation schemes to maximize the minimum sensing performance between the sub-bands. we propose iterative hierarchical hungarian allocation(IHHA), bow-shaped allocation(BSA), class division allocation(CDA) to realize the Max-Min objective. Furthermore, on the basis of PU priority level and anti-interference capability, the frequency band property parameter (BPP) is defined. By improving the minimum sensing performance with BPP, modified fairness that suits for the actual scene is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed schemes perform excellently in improving the overall sensing fairness of the whole system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666568/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13901835","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666568/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive node allocation scheme for wideband spectrum sensing fairness in cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive node allocation scheme for wideband spectrum sensing fairness in cognitive radio network","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2507liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06563S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666570,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Ying Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Ying","lastName":"Wu","id":"38183219200"},{"name":"Kuo-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086713528"},{"name":"Po-Han Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Han","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085778666"},{"name":"Wanjiun Liao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wanjiun","lastName":"Liao","id":"37273521700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666570","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Relays","Cognitive radio","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Games","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","radio networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed cooperation strategy","cognitive radio network","secondary user","SU","CRN","cooperative transmission","wireless spectrum","primary user","PU","frequency bandwidth","interference","greedy distributed solution","horizontal cooperation scheme","vertical cooperation scheme","resource utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio networks (CRN)","vertical cooperation","horizontal cooperation","game theory","payment-based method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666570","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666570","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","abstract":"In this paper, we study how to improve the usage of wireless spectrum for secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) by cooperative transmissions. There are two types of cooperation in CRNs, namely, vertical cooperation, which takes place between primary users (PUs) and SUs, and horizontal cooperation, which occurs among SUs. For vertical cooperation, PUs can lease their frequency bandwidth for a fraction of time to SUs in exchange for better transmission quality through cooperative transmission from the SUs. For horizontal cooperation, some SUs will help other SUs to increase their transmission throughput through cooperative transmissions without interfering with their neighboring PUs. In fact, both vertical cooperation and horizontal cooperation can improve the system throughput. Hence, if both types of cooperation can be supported in a CRN, the system throughput can be improved effectively. However, SUs cannot perform both types of cooperation simultaneously. Therefore, determining the kind of cooperation for an SU is an important issue on the system throughput improvement. We solve this problem via a greedy distributed solution in which the decision made by each SU depends only on the local information. We show by simulations that our proposed method outperforms traditional vertical cooperation schemes or horizontal cooperation schemes in terms of better resource utilization and higher system throughput.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2517","endPage":"2521","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666570.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed cooperation strategy in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666570/","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed cooperation strategy in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901822","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed cooperation strategy in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2517wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060822S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666573,"authors":[{"name":"Julio Soto","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Brazil"],"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Soto","id":"38529363500"},{"name":"Michele Nogueira","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Brazil"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Nogueira","id":"37848030500"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy Chowdhury","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Eng.

For example, primary user emulation, intelligent jamming and denial of service for spectrum usage may impact the performance of classical spectrum sensing approaches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cooperative sensing framework that can flexibly incorporate a variety of physical layer features to identify cases related to malicious behavior and genuine node failures. Though our approach is distributed, it is resilient in the sense that it does not simply rely on majority voting by a collection of nearby nodes. The key contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) A multiple criteria analysis technique and a non-parametric Bayesian inference method are formulated for identifying the spectrum holes that are least susceptible to malicious activity and failures, and (ii) Using real traces from the CRAWDAD data repository, we test our framework in a variety of practical settings, to prove the performance benefit of our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666573/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13902175","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666573/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Resilient and multi-dimensional cooperative spectrum sensing on cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resilient and multi-dimensional cooperative spectrum sensing on cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2533soto.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055528S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666584,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhao","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Electronique et T\u00e9l\u00e9communication de Rennes (IETR), Polytech Nantes LUNAM Universit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e9 de Nantes UMR CNRS"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086646796"},{"name":"Yide Wang","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Electronique et T\u00e9l\u00e9communication de Rennes (IETR), Polytech Nantes LUNAM Universit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e9 de Nantes UMR CNRS"],"firstName":"Yide","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281423000"},{"name":"Pascal Charg\u00e9","affiliation":["Institut de Recherche en Electronique et T\u00e9l\u00e9communication de Rennes (IETR), Polytech Nantes LUNAM Universit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e9 de Nantes UMR CNRS"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Charg\u00e9","id":"38267385400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666584","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Resource management","Interference","Downlink","Vectors","Optimization","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","channel allocation","computational complexity","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","interference suppression","iterative methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal to noise ratio","MUI","beamforming design","generalized eigenvalue technique","iterative waterfilling algorithm","exponential computational complexity","multiuser interference","signomial optimization problem","base station","channel state information","multiple input multiple output","sum rate optimization","multiuser MIMO broadcast channel","power allocation strategy"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, sum rate optimization of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output broadcast (MU-MIMO) communication systems with perfect channel state information (CSI) at the base station is investigated. Since power allocation is a signomial optimization problem in the presence of multiuser interference (MUI), it is not a convex problem in general. Several optimal solutions proposed in the literature have exponential computational complexity, which is hard to implement for practice. We propose an iterative water-filling algorithm that takes advantage of the classical simple water-filling principle. The proposed algorithm reduces significantly the computational complexity compared with the methods in the literature only with a negligible performance degradation. In addition, the generalized eigenvalue technique for beamforming design is utilized in this paper for minimizing MUI, the number of users and the number of antennas of each user can be arbitrary.

Feature detector is chosen for its accuracy under low SNR, and CS is introduced to alleviate the sampling bottleneck of wideband sensing. Moreover, noise caused by the CS process is analyzed, and a traditional noise reduction method-two dimensional wavelet transform is utilized to cope with it by treating the spectral correlation function (SCF) as a grey image. It is verified by simulation that WT can effectively reduce the noise introduced by CS, and the proposed detector can achieve 90% detection probability under -10dB, making cyclostationary detection

design for a cooperative relay system with limited feedback","abstract":"In this paper, we focus on a half-duplex downlink cellular system with relay cooperation. We consider the beam-forming design problem with a limited amount of feedback for channel state information (CSI), which is only available at the receiver side. Based on this structure, we calculate the sum-rate lower bound when zero forcing (ZF) or eigen-beamforming is implemented at the macro base station and relay station. With the lower bound, we optimize the numbers of feedback bits for quantizing the desired and interfering channels and propose an adaptive beamforming strategy with limited feedback which selects a suitable beamforming scheme from ZF or eigen-beamforming based on the received interference and noise power level of the users. Simulation result shows that the bit partitioning algorithm outperforms the equal bit distribution scheme especially when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is large. In addition, our proposed adaptive beamforming strategy outperforms existing schemes in different interference scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666589/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13902277","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666589/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming design for a cooperative relay system with limited feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming design for a cooperative relay system with limited feedback","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2616tao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051307S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666591,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Achtzehn","affiliation":["Institute for Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Achtzehn","id":"37392129100"},{"name":"Ljiljana Simi\u0107","affiliation":["Institute for Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ljiljana","lastName":"Simi\u0107","id":"37072881800"},{"name":"Peter Gronerth","affiliation":["Institute for Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Gronerth","id":"37072838000"},{"name":"Petri M\u00e4h\u00f6nen","affiliation":["Institute for Networked Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Petri","lastName":"M\u00e4h\u00f6nen","id":"37266541100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666591","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":366},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 Standards","Antenna measurements","Correlation","Buildings","Cities and towns","Area measurement","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical analysis","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-pair correlation functions","homogeneous Poisson point process","nearest-neighbour distributions","spatial statistics","localization technique","access point density","wireless Internet","offloading strategies","small-cell networks","Germany","large-scale random network structure","multitier architectures","opportunistic networks spatial structure","IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi deployments"]}],"abstract":"An understanding of the underlying spatial structure of user-deployed wireless networks is invaluable for the design and optimization of opportunistic small-cell technologies in emerging multi-tier architectures. IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi networks provide a real-world example of such a large-scale random network structure. In this paper we report on a high-resolution measurement survey of Wi-Fi deployments in Germany as a step towards deriving more sophisticated spatial models for transmitter distributions in emerging small-cell networks, which are the core of offloading strategies for future wireless Internet. Using a custom setup, our measurement campaign covered a range of urbanization and land use scenarios representative of Wi-Fi deployments in developed countries. Our data indicates a 14-fold increase in Wi-Fi density in urban residential areas over the last decade, consistent with increased broadband penetration. This supports our hypothesis that household density has become a strong predictor of access point (AP) density. We infer AP locations using a novel localization technique suitable for large measurement campaigns using off-the-shelf equipment. From this data, we derive pertinent spatial statistics to characterize the topologies of opportunistic networks. We derive nearest-neighbour distributions showing that realistic inter-neighbour distances are higher than predicted by a homogeneous Poisson Point Process, underlining the need for more refined spatial models than the random node location models which are currently prevalent. We also derive the two-pair correlation functions for the AP locations, showing that AP clustering is apparent over a large range of distances in our data set, which has implications for routing and interference mitigation.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666591","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666591.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2627","endPage":"2632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Survey of IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi deployments for deriving the spatial structure of opportunistic networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Survey of IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi deployments for deriving the spatial structure of opportunistic networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666591/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902213","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666591/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey of IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi deployments for deriving the spatial structure of opportunistic networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2627achtzehn.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07204S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6666597,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Qian","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, China Radio Research Lab, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Qian","id":"37534724300"},{"name":"Zhiheng Guo","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, China Radio Research Lab, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiheng","lastName":"Guo","id":"38542909500"},{"name":"Rui Fan","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, China Radio Research Lab, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Fan","id":"37085500240"},{"name":"Hai Wang","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, China Radio Research Lab, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085497931"},{"name":"Jianjun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086719959"},{"name":"Yuan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086718184"},{"name":"Xiaodong Shen","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Shen","id":"37557792300"},{"name":"Zhenping Hu","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication, China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenping","lastName":"Hu","id":"38513944300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666597","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Floors","Throughput","Base stations","Antennas","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","Long Term Evolution","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outdoor coverage system","TD-LTE in-band relay system","mobile user experience","remote macrobase stations","indoor coverage system","received signal power","Long Term Evolution system","wireless backhaul","penetration loss","field test","indoor received signal power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TD-LTE","relay","outdoor to indoor coverage"]}],"abstract":"Indoor coverage is essential to the mobile user experience, because the signal power from the remote macro base stations is seriously weakened after penetrating the walls. Traditional indoor coverage system is a good solution but it can not be deployed in all the buildings. In order to enhance the received signal power inside the building, a relay can be used in a long term evolution (LTE) system. The benefits of relay are: it can be deployed anywhere quite near to the building since it uses wireless backhaul with less position limitation, and thus it can amplify the transmitting power due to the nearby position to the building comparing to the remote macro base stations. Then even with penetration loss, the received signal power inside the building is still high enough to carry traffic. The field test results show that a TD-LTE relay can improve the indoor received signal power and traffic obviously, and thus it's a good solution to enhance outdoor to indoor coverage.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666597","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666597.pdf","startPage":"2658","endPage":"2662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving outdoor to indoor coverage by use of TD-LTE in-band relay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666597/","displayDocTitle":"Improving outdoor to indoor coverage by use of TD-LTE in-band relay","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902048","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666597/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving outdoor to indoor coverage by use of TD-LTE in-band relay","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2658guo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074222S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666603,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6mer Bulakci","affiliation":["Huawei European Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"\u00d6mer","lastName":"Bulakci","id":"37078646100"},{"name":"Jyri H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications and Networking, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Jyri","lastName":"H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","id":"37086658082"},{"name":"Egon Schulz","affiliation":["Huawei European Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Egon","lastName":"Schulz","id":"37266353400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666603","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666603","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Shadow mapping","Fading","Gain","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","log normal distribution","multipath channels","Nakagami channels","relay networks (telecommunication)","Rician channels","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coarse relay site planning","composite fading environments","composite shadowing environments","relay deployments","macrocell networks","wireless relay link","relay node","base station","BS","compact physical characteristics","low-power consumption","RN deployment location","discrete set","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","coarse RSP","wireless channels","multipath fading","two-hop cellular relay networks","cochannel interference","Nakagami-lognormal distribution","mobile terminal","MT","Rician-lognormal distribution","closed-form expressions","link rates","end-to-end rate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666603","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666603.pdf","startPage":"2689","endPage":"2694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of coarse relay site planning in composite fading/shadowing environments","abstract":"Relay deployments promise to alleviate the limitations of conventional macrocell networks, such as poor indoor penetration and coverage holes in a cost-efficient way. In this context, the capacity of the wireless relay link between a relay node (RN) and its serving base station (BS) has a crucial role in the achievable end-to-end performance. The deployment flexibility of RNs, which mainly stems from the wireless relay link, compact physical characteristics, and low-power consumption, can be exploited by relay site planning (RSP) to overcome the limitations of the relay link and, thus, enhance the system performance. To this end, RSP is carried out via selecting an RN deployment location from a discrete set of alternatives considering the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) on the relay link as the selection criterion. In practice, the so-called coarse RSP takes into account only large-scale fading due to shadowing. Nevertheless, as RNs are stationary, the wireless channels pertaining to relay deployments are subject to simultaneous impairments by both shadowing and multi-path fading, i.e., composite fading/shadowing. In this paper, we present the performance of coarse RSP that can be used for planning and dimensioning of two-hop cellular relay networks in composite fading/shadowing environments, where co-channel interference is also present. The relay link is modeled by Nakagami-lognormal distribution while the access link between a mobile terminal (MT) and its serving RN is modeled by Rician-lognormal distribution. Furthermore, we provide an accurate analytical framework through closed-form expressions for relay link SINR, link rates, and end-to-end rate. Results show that coarse RSP can still yield high performance improvements considering composite fading/shadowing channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666603/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13901904","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666603/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of coarse relay site planning in composite fading/shadowing environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of coarse relay site planning in composite fading/shadowing environments","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2689bulakci.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070145S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666606,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo A.

Our approach is focused on optimizing the circuit consumed power of the single antenna devices rather than on the transmitted power, thus the total device power consumption including the effect of the power amplifiers is taken into account. Furthermore, we show analytically and by simulation that under certain conditions cooperation does not improve the energy efficiency metric of network users, thus single antenna devices prefer to transmit independently in order to maintain the user's performance in the network. Additionally, our distributed approach reduces the communication overhead by 76% when compared with a centralized global optimum scheme, which is coordinated from the base station.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666606","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666606.pdf","startPage":"2707","endPage":"2712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stable marriage framework for distributed virtual MIMO coalition formation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666606/","displayDocTitle":"A stable marriage framework for distributed virtual MIMO coalition formation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902101","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666606/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stable marriage framework for distributed virtual MIMO coalition formation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2707vacaramirez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058691S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666607,"authors":[{"name":"Narjes Torabi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British, Columbia"],"firstName":"Narjes","lastName":"Torabi","id":"37645101400"},{"name":"Shantanu Bhate","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British, Columbia"],"firstName":"Shantanu","lastName":"Bhate","id":"37086750095"},{"name":"Victor C.

Implicitly, collocated networks have different levels of spectrum access priority due to their design parameters (e.g., transmission power, modulation and coding), such that a WLAN tends to achieve a higher access priority compared to a coexisting WPAN. Instead of using a predetermined radio channel in the ISM band, a device can perform dynamic spectrum access using a frequency agile radio to take advantage of spectrum holes that are found between transmissions of collocated networks, thus improving its opportunities to access the ISM band for interference-free transmissions. This paper proposes the dual spectrum sensing strategy for capturing spectrum holes that are wide enough to accommodate the transmissions of a device. Our method makes no assumption about the technologies (e.g., modulation schemes or power spectral density) of detected radio transmissions, and properly handles power variations in the form of gradually changing power values as well as sharp rise/fall edges in the detection of occupied parts of the spectrum. Field test results show that ample white-spaces exist to enable frequency-agile IEEE 802.15.4-based devices to access the ISM band opportunistically.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2713","endPage":"2717","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666607.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust sensing strategy for dynamic spectrum access in the 2.4 GHz ISM band","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666607/","displayDocTitle":"Robust sensing strategy for dynamic spectrum access in the 2.4 GHz ISM band","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902183","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust sensing strategy for dynamic spectrum access in the 2.4 GHz ISM band","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2713torabi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054428S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666608,"authors":[{"name":"Shaswar Baban","affiliation":["King's College London, Institute of Telecommunications, London, UK"],"firstName":"Shaswar","lastName":"Baban","id":"37085704670"},{"name":"Daniel Denkoviski","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, Ss.

Unlicensed users (secondaries) need to be able to differentiate between transmissions of licensed users (primaries) and other unlicensed users. Furthermore, secondaries should only free a band when the licensed primary user starts to transmit. In this regard, secondary users' transmission technology classification will have a vital role for coexistence/cooperation purposes in such shared spectrum bands. For the purpose of this work, a practical testbed made up of software defined radio transceivers and a set of computing units was put together.

Deploying dense small cell networks overlaying the conventional macro cell networks is widely regarded as a key step towards network architecture revolution for improved spectrum and energy efficiency. In this paper, we analytically investigate the spectrum efficiency of densely deployed small cell networks in the downlink using tools from stochastic geometry. Unlike the conventional user-centric link-level spectrum efficiency analysis, we analyze network spectrum efficiency, defined as the average aggregate spectrum efficiency per cell. As the portion of cell-edge users, who would consume more spectrum resource in achieving a target rate, usually outweighs that of the cell-center users, network spectrum efficiency evaluation should count user distribution to portray the network performance as a whole. Based on the network spectrum efficiency results, we are able to find the optimal cell density and the corresponding optimal base station transmit power for achieving a high spectrum efficiency and/or energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666617","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666617.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2764","endPage":"2768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical study on network spectrum efficiency of ultra dense networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical study on network spectrum efficiency of ultra dense networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666617/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902038","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666617/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical study on network spectrum efficiency of ultra dense networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2764li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106755S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666618,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Luo","affiliation":["Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086684702"},{"name":"Yusheng Ji","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusheng","lastName":"Ji","id":"37287372900"},{"name":"Aihuang Guo","affiliation":["Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Aihuang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37584022500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666618","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":562},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666618","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Throughput","Array signal processing","Macrocell networks","Long Term Evolution","Computational complexity","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3GPP","signaling overhead mitigation","LTE-advanced HetNet","low-power cell edge user","CoMP coordinated beamforming","channel quality","intercell interference elimination","almost blank subframe scheme","coordinated multipoint","intercell interference coordination","long term evolution","adaptive ABS-CoMP scheme","LTE-advanced heterogeneous network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666618","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666618.pdf","startPage":"2769","endPage":"2773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive ABS-CoMP scheme in LTE-Advanced heterogeneous networks","abstract":"As one of the key technical challenges in long term evolution (LTE)-Advanced heterogeneous networks (HetNets) is intercell interference coordination, many different schemes, such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP) and almost blank subframe (ABS) schemes, have been proposed in this field. Different cells are pushed to cooperate to eliminate intercell interference in CoMP coordinated beamforming, but performance is heavily dependent on the quality of channels. ABS schemes allow highpower cells to transmit almost blank subframes, and avoid interference with low-power cell edge users, which will in turn result in reduced high-power cell throughput as cost. An adaptive ABS-CoMP scheme in an LTE-Advanced HetNet is proposed, which combines both the ABS and CoMP coordinated beamforming schemes to eliminate intercell interference, and adaptive transmits signals in different ways. It is assumed to improve system throughput and mitigate signaling overhead and computational complexity.

We propose a total power consumption model including drive power, decoding power, and power consumption of power amplifier (PA). This model is formulated as a function of drive power, which gives an easy access to the system level optimisation. The optimal drive power that minimises the total power consumption while satisfying the performance requirement can be found by numerical searching method. The impact of relay's locations on the total power consumption is also investigated. We show that, with the same performance requirement, in the small source-relay separation case AF consumes less power than DF, while with larger separation, AF consumes significantly more power than DF. This is different from the common intuition that DF is always more power consuming than AF due to the extra decoding power consumption at relay, which is due to the fact that the large source-relay separation limits the effective destination signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in AF, leading to more substantial decoding power consumption in the many more decoding iterations than DF.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666625","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666625.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2808","endPage":"2812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power efficient 60 GHz wireless communication networks with relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power efficient 60 GHz wireless communication networks with relays","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666625/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902120","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666625/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power efficient 60 GHz wireless communication networks with relays","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2808dong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058197S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666628,"authors":[{"name":"Liqiang Zhao","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Liqiang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279829600"},{"name":"Guogang Zhao","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Guogang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085683740"},{"name":"Tim O'Farrell","affiliation":["The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, Sheffield, GB"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"O'Farrell","id":"37271643800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666628","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"abstract":"Green wireless communications have received increasing attention from government, academia, and industry. However, how to define a green wireless communication system has been an open topic. In this paper, firstly, we present the definition of green efficiency of wireless links and carry out a comprehensive analysis of the efficiency metrics, e.g., the b/s/Hz spectrum efficiency, the b/s/Hz/W energy efficiency, the b/TENU power efficiency and our proposed (b\u00b7m)/s/Hz/W green efficiency of a wireless link, in particular we can prove that green efficiency is a strict convex function with respect to transmission power and distance. Secondly, by tuning the cell size with users' QoS (quality of service) guarantee, we introduce green efficiency into a cellular network and achieve the theoretical upper bound of green efficiency for a cellular network. Finally, we present a green efficiency-based network planning method for practical environment. Simulation results show that the proposed network planning mechanism can approach the upper bound of green efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Green products","Wireless communication","Measurement","Energy efficiency","Upper bound","Planning","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","quality of service","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficiency metrics","government","academia","industry","green wireless communication system","wireless links","b-s-Hz spectrum efficiency","b-s-Hz-W energy efficiency","b-TENU power efficiency","(b\u00b7m)-s-Hz-W green efficiency","convex function","transmission power","cell size","QoS guarantee","quality of service","cellular network","network planning method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Green Wireless Communications","Efficiency","Network Planning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666628","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666628.pdf","startPage":"2825","endPage":"2829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency metrics for wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency metrics for wireless communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666628/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901938","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency metrics for wireless communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2825zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031011S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6666628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6666634,"authors":[{"name":"Jongwoo Hong","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jongwoo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085430992"},{"name":"Seungil Park","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seungil","lastName":"Park","id":"37085438208"},{"name":"Hakseong Kim","affiliation":["LG Electronics CTO, Anyang, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Hakseong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086733254"},{"name":"Sunghyun Choi","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghyun","lastName":"Choi","id":"37279913300"},{"name":"Kwang Bok Lee","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang Bok","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281491600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666634","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":9,"totalDownloads":1162},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Device-to-Device discovery and link setup in LTE networks","abstract":"Device-to-Device (D2D) communications allow devices to communicate directly without going through infrastructure.

MIMO cognitive radio is a kind of cognitive radios using MIMO beamforming techniques to avoid interference to other nodes. There are many theoretical works on this topic but validation of the algorithm on real hardware has not been realized. Most of these works assume perfect CSI though it is always obtained with errors in practice, especially CSIT. It is known that MIMO beamforming techniques are sensitive to CSI errors and their performance might severely be degraded in practice. Despite the fact that cognitive radio with MIMO beamforming techniques is powerful in terms of spatial efficiency as shown by theoretical results, the feasibility of such systems in real environment have never been studied before. Therefore, we attempt to provide the first implementation of a MIMO cognitive radio system using Tx/Rx beamforming and prove the feasibility by measuring its throughput performance. In this paper, we will explain our implementation and measurement results. In the measurement, we measure achievable throughput of both primary and secondary system. As a result, we found that this system works effectively when transmit power of primary nodes is large enough while that of the secondary nodes is relatively small.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiment on MIMO cognitive radio using Tx/Rx beamforming","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666637","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666637.pdf","startPage":"2871","endPage":"2875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Experiment on MIMO cognitive radio using Tx/Rx beamforming","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666637/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916156","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiment on MIMO cognitive radio using Tx/Rx beamforming","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2871iwata.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041254S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666638,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Choy Chai","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chin Choy","lastName":"Chai","id":"37276677500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666638","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Uplink","Interference","Femtocell networks","Optimization","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio links","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation scheme","distributed joint subcarrier","total spectral efficiency","interference management","home subscriber","ad-hoc manner","base station","HeNB","home eNode B","PU network","primary user","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","OFDMA-based cognitive femtocell radio uplink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocells","distributed subcarrier and power allocation","OFDMA","uplink","cognitive radios"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we focus on a cognitive radio (CR) femtocell network that operates in an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based primary user (PU) network.

This scheme considers the primary user (PU) activity, secondary user (SU) mobility and channel heterogeneity in the spectrum handoff decision. To reduce the handoff delay, handoff thresholds are used. When the spectrum handoff cannot be done due to the SU's mobility, a local flow handoff (LFH) is performed to find a node in the vicinity of a potential link breakage where the data flow is transferred to the node. The proposed proactive IHM scheme predicts the cognitive link availability that considers the interference to PUs to estimate the maximum link availability time. The availability time is then used in the channel allocation scheme. The results emphasized on improvement of the route maintenance probability using LFH. It is also verified that the number of handoff needed is significantly decreased using the proposed proactive IHM scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"2887","endPage":"2892","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666640.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated handoff management in cognitive radio mobile ad hoc networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666640/","displayDocTitle":"Integrated handoff management in cognitive radio mobile ad hoc networks","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13916126","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated handoff management in cognitive radio mobile ad hoc networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2887nejatian.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046235S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666641,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud M.

The analysis is developed based on a generalized model for cognitive radio networks where multiple primary users with independent activity factors are considered. The adjacent matrix elements, representing the weights associated to the network graph edges, are set proportional to the activity factors of primary users. It is shown that the proposed connectivity metric is a monotonically decreasing measure with the primary users activity factors. Furthermore, the metric efficiently determines the network connectivity under different primary users activities. The proposed connectivity metric is compared to the probability of finding a route metric which is commonly used as a measure for network connectivity. It is shown that the proposed metric captures the behavior of the probability of finding a route method with significant complexity reduction. Compared to the algebraic connectivity metric, the proposed metric is more robust in the presence of isolated nodes. Finally, the proposed metric can be utilized to analytically study and design cognitive radio networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666641/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13901934","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666641/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new connectivity metric for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new connectivity metric for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p2893gad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051448S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666662,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Hao Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Hao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086762325"},{"name":"Li-Chuan Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chuan","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37564864600"},{"name":"ChingYao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"ChingYao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281272100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666662","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666662","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Cognitive radio","Vectors","Stochastic processes","History","Convergence","Dynamic spectrum access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","learning (artificial intelligence)","radio networks","radio spectrum management","stochastic games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","stochastic learning","spectrum utilization","spectrum scarcity","dynamic spectrum access technique","CR network architectures","CR base stations","CRBSs","economical Cournot game model","SL based scheme","action-reward history","NE point","Nash equilibrium point"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network","Cournot game","Stochastic learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666662","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666662.pdf","startPage":"3006","endPage":"3010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive radio networks: Game modeling and self-organization using stochastic learning","abstract":"Due to the high demand of spectrum utilization, cognitive radio (CR) network has been a promising solution to the problem of spectrum scarcity by using dynamic spectrum access technique.

We consider a secondary user, equipped with multiple transmit antennas, that is allowed to access the spectrum of the primary network only if it does not interfere to the reception of the primary users. The proposed precoder is based on the signal to leakage plus noise ratio (SLNR) criterion, with additional scaling to comply with the cognitive constraint. The proposed Scaled SLNR (SSLNR) scheme is attractive for practical cognitive wireless networks as it combines near optimal performance with low implementation complexity. The SSLNR parameter is optimized using stochastic geometry analysis of an alternative gated zero-forcing scheme. The optimal parameter value is shown to depend only on the system parameters and not on the primary network density. Simulations results demonstrate the accuracy of the optimization, and show that the performance of the resulting SSLNR scheme is close to the performance of the optimal solution.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666663","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666663.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666663","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"3011","endPage":"3015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaled SLNR precoding for cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Scaled SLNR precoding for cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666663/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902032","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaled SLNR precoding for cognitive radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3011richter.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046356S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6666663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6666665,"authors":[{"name":"F.

It includes a reliability tester module that detects, based on hypothesis testing, relevant changes in suitability levels of spectrum resources to support a set of heterogeneous applications. These changes are captured through a set of advanced statistics stored in a knowledge database and exploited by a proactive spectrum management strategy to assist both spectrum selection and spectrum mobility functionalities. The results reveal that the proposed reliability tester is able to disregard the changes due to the intrinsic randomness of the radio environment and to efficiently detect actual changes in interference conditions of spectrum pools. Thanks to this support, the proposed spectrum management strategy exhibits substantial robustness when the environment becomes non-stationary, obtaining performance improvements of up to 75% with respect to the reference case that does not make use of the reliability tester functionality.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666665","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666665.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666665","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"3022","endPage":"3027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge management framework for robust cognitive radio operation in non-stationary environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge management framework for robust cognitive radio operation in non-stationary environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666665/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666665/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902201","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge management framework for robust cognitive radio operation in non-stationary environments","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3022bouali.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093478S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666666,"authors":[{"name":"Azar Zarrebini-Esfahani","affiliation":["Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College London, Strand, UK"],"firstName":"Azar","lastName":"Zarrebini-Esfahani","id":"38357952400"},{"name":"Tuan Anh Le","affiliation":["Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College London, Strand, UK"],"firstName":"Tuan Anh","lastName":"Le","id":"37538036200"},{"name":"Mohammad Reza Nakhai","affiliation":["Centre for Telecommunications Research, King's College London, Strand, UK"],"firstName":"Mohammad Reza","lastName":"Nakhai","id":"37296995600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666666","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Optimization","Gain","Vectors","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","cognitive radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-efficient coverage scheme","cognitive beamforming","intercell interference","primary cell borders","cognitive base stations","primary cell-edge users","cognitive cells","primary base stations","secondary users","optimization problem","primary outer-cell","signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio","SINR","cognitive structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","beamforming","intercell interference","semidefinite programming"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A power-efficient coverage scheme for cell-edge users using cognitive beamforming","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","endPage":"3032","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666666.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666666","startPage":"3028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666666","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of strong intercell interference on cell-edge users in conventional cellular networks by deploying cognitive cells within the vicinity of primary cell borders.

To address this problem, operators have started deploying large numbers of small cells. In order to operate such small cell network cost-effectively they need to be able to intelligently optimize their configuration, which can be achieved by applying machine learning techniques such as genetic programming. The use of genetic programming has previously been used to derive joint coverage algorithms for a group of enterprise femtocells. However, the evolution of the algorithms was performed in an offline manner, on a pre-defined simulation model of the deployment scenario. In this paper, an approach to perform the evolution in an online manner using an automated model building process is presented. The model building process uses network traces as inputs to create a hierarchical Markov model that is shown to be able to capture the behavior of the femtocell network well. It is shown that the resulting environment model can effectively drive the on-line evolution of coverage optimization algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online evolution of femtocell coverage algorithms using genetic programming","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666667","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666667.pdf","startPage":"3033","endPage":"3038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Online evolution of femtocell coverage algorithms using genetic programming","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666667/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902110","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online evolution of femtocell coverage algorithms using genetic programming","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3033ho.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062132S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666670,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Xu","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37595306300"},{"name":"Gledi Kutrolli","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gledi","lastName":"Kutrolli","id":"37070266500"},{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666670","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Throughput","Power control","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Macrocell networks","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Long Term Evolution","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous downlink power control scheme","LTE femtocells","channel quality indicator","perfect coordination","base stations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","power control","LTE","CQI"]}],"abstract":"In this work, a downlink power control scheme based on channel quality indicator (CQI) is proposed for LTE femtocells.

Due to the lack of availability of fixed-lined backhaul at desired locations and due to cost saving reasons, operators may deploy a variety of backhaul technologies in a given network, combining available technologies such as fiber, xDSL, wireless backhaul and multi-hop mesh networks to backhaul small-cells. As a consequence, small-cells capacity may be non-uniform in the HetNet. Furthermore, some small-cells backhaul capacity may fluctuate if wireless backhaul is chosen. With such concerns in mind, a new network selection strategy considering small-cell backhaul capacity is proposed to ensure that users enjoy the best possible user experience especially in terms of connection throughput and fairness. The study compares performance of several common Network Selection Schemes (NSSs) such as WiFi First (WF) and Physical Data Rate (PDR) with the proposed Dynamic Backhaul Capacity Sensitive (DyBaCS) NSS in LTE-WiFi HetNets. The downlink performance of HetNet is evaluated in terms of average throughput per user and fairness among users. The effects of varying WiFi backhaul capacity form the focus for the evaluation. Results show that the DyBaCS scheme generally provides superior performance in terms of fairness and average throughput per user across the range of backhaul capacities considered.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666672","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666672.pdf","startPage":"3061","endPage":"3065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic backhaul sensitive Network Selection Scheme in LTE-WiFi wireless HetNet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic backhaul sensitive Network Selection Scheme in LTE-WiFi wireless HetNet","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13902160","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666672/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666672/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic backhaul sensitive Network Selection Scheme in LTE-WiFi wireless HetNet","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3061ting.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08137S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666674,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Olariu","affiliation":["TSSG, Waterford Institute of Technology, Waterford, Ireland"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Olariu","id":"37949511700"},{"name":"John Fitzpatrick","affiliation":["Openet, Dublin, DB, Ireland"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Fitzpatrick","id":"37410235200"},{"name":"Yacine Ghamri-Doudane","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, LIGM Lab, France"],"firstName":"Yacine","lastName":"Ghamri-Doudane","id":"38270773200"},{"name":"Liam Murphy","affiliation":["Openet, Dublin, DB, Ireland"],"firstName":"Liam","lastName":"Murphy","id":"37268295300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666674","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Femtocells","Logic gates","Quality of service","Wireless communication","Computer architecture","IEEE 802.11 Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Internet telephony","protocols","telecommunication congestion control","wireless LAN","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["call capacity","femtocell","voice services","voice over IP","VoIP call quality","WiFi-based wireless mesh network","WMN","femto-over-mesh","call admission control","CAC mechanism","network congestion","IEEE 802.11e protocol","delay-piggy-backing mechanism","intermediate network node"]}],"abstract":"The primary contribution of this paper is the design of a novel architecture and mechanisms to enable voice services to be deployed over femtocells backhauled using a wireless mesh network. The architecture combines three mechanisms designed to improve Voice Over IP (VoIP) call quality and capacity in a deployment comprised of meshed femtocells backhauled over a WiFi-based Wireless Mesh Network (WMN), or femto-over-mesh. The three mechanisms are: (i) a Call Admission Control (CAC) mechanism employed to protect the network against congestion; (ii) the frame aggregation feature of the 802.11e protocol which allows multiple smaller frames to be aggregated into a single larger frame; and (iii) a novel delay-piggy-backing mechanism with two key benefits: prioritizing delayed packets over less delayed packets, and enabling the measurement of voice call quality at intermediate network nodes rather than just at the path end-points. The results show that the combination of the three mechanisms improves the system capacity for high quality voice calls while preventing the network from accepting calls which would result in call quality degradation across all calls, and while maximizing the call capacity available with a given set of network resources.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666674","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666674.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"3071","endPage":"3076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Provisioning call quality and capacity for femtocells over wireless mesh backhaul","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Provisioning call quality and capacity for femtocells over wireless mesh backhaul","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666674/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902180","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666674/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Provisioning call quality and capacity for femtocells over wireless mesh backhaul","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3071olariu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04648S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666680,"authors":[{"name":"Sibel Tombaz","affiliation":["Wireless@KTH, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Sibel","lastName":"Tombaz","id":"37398324900"},{"name":"Zhihao Zheng","affiliation":["Wireless@KTH, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhihao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086763867"},{"name":"Jens Zander","affiliation":["Wireless@KTH, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Zander","id":"37278665600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666680","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Throughput","Ultrafast optics","Optical switches","Base stations","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","energy conservation","femtocellular radio","indoor radio","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency assessment","wireless access networks","indoor base stations","mobile radio networks","energy cost","energy consumption","macrocellular umbrella coverage","joint macrocell-femtocell deployment","cochannel interference","femto base station density","backhaul power consumption","data traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Efficiency","Femtocells","Co-channel Deployment","Backhaul","Power Consumption"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666680","abstract":"Energy efficiency in mobile radio networks has recently gained great interest due to escalating energy cost and environmental concerns.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of joint macro-and femtocell deployment on energy efficiency of wireless access networks, based on varying area throughput requirements. We take into account the the co-channel interference, fraction of indoor users, femto base station density and backhaul power consumption.

In this paper, we consider an underlay cognitive radio system where a large number of secondary users (SUs) can share the spectrum with a primary user (UP). We assume that M antennas are used at the cognitive base station (CBS) and the CBS does not have the full channel state information (CSI) from secondary users. We propose to study the problem of secondary users scheduling under the assumption of imperfect CSI of the interference channel between the CBS and the primary receiver. In order to minimize the interference to the UP, we propose to generate orthogonal beams to the estimate of the channel between the CBS and the PU. Then, to reduce the amount of required feedback, we propose a scheduling algorithm based on opportunistic beamforming. To further reduce the amount of feedback, a threshold is applied to the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) feedback.

This neighborhood discovery phase, also referred to as a rendezvous (RDV) phase, is challenging due to the dynamics of CRNs. There are a number of different proposed solutions (pseudo-random or systematic approaches such as quorum systems) to tackle this issue, however, not so many elaborate on the asynchronous character of CRNs, and even less taking into account channel heterogeneity in terms of quality. In this study, on the one hand, we propose a novel quorum system-based neighborhood discovery protocol, which operates on channels having different priorities, on the other hand, we perform an analysis of the effect of asynchronism on the proposed protocol. We analyze the behavior of the protocol in terms of rendezvous opportunities, time-to-rendezvous, and the measured error margins for both, for different asynchronous offsets. We show that an asynchronism can bring noticeable profits over the slot synchronized case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13902019","htmlLink":"/document/6666689/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of asynchronism of a neighborhood discovery protocol for cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of asynchronism of a neighborhood discovery protocol for cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3155romaszko.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083446S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666691,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Stringent delay sensitive calls in CRNs are susceptible to forced termination due to the preemptive resource occupancy priority of primary users. To enable more efficient usage of the spectrum while improving the QoS experienced by secondary users (SUs), dynamic spectrum leasing (and coordinated cognitive radio) of resources has been previously proposed in the literature. In this paper, the Erlang capacity in coordinated cognitive radio networks with real-time hard delay constraint traffic as function of the rented resources is analytically calculated. For the adequate and fair performance comparison, call admission with fractional channel reservation to prioritize ongoing secondary calls over new ones is considered. From numerical results, it is observed that in CRNs exists a critical utilization factor of the primary resources from which it is not longer possible to guarantee the required QoS of SUs and, therefore, delay sensitive services cannot be even supported in cognitive radio networks. Thus, spectrum leasing can be essential for CRN operators to provide the QoS demanded by delay sensitive services. Then, the cost per capacity Erlang as function of both the utilization factor of the primary resources and the maximum allowed number of simultaneously rented channels is evaluated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666691/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13902211","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666691/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Erlang capacity in coordinated cognitive radio networks with stringent-delay applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Erlang capacity in coordinated cognitive radio networks with stringent-delay applications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3166castellanoslopez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115733S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666697,"authors":[{"name":"Shengyu Li","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Shengyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37071823500"},{"name":"Wenjun Xu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404292300"},{"name":"Shuanglu Zhang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Shuanglu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37071083100"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404490700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666697","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"In this paper, cooperative multicast with the help of short-range data sharing is studied in the cognitive radio networks (CRNs). The original multicast data is split into many segments, and the transmission of each segment is divided into two stages. In the first stage, cognitive base station transmits each segment to the corresponding cooperative user, and in the second stage, the cooperative user decodes the received data and broadcasts it to other multicast users. Based on this transmission model, cooperative multicast is formulated as an optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the total transmission rate. Afterwards, we first propose a cooperative user selection strategy, which is meaningful when the multicast size is large, and then implement the resource allocation with dual translation and subgradient updating. The simulation results show that the proposed cooperative multicast scheme can achieve much higher spectrum efficiency than both conventional multicast scheme and multiple description coding multicast scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications

paper proposes an energy-efficient multicast scheme for downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in which the base station (BS) is equipped with multiple antennas. We employ the multiple description coding multicast (MDCM) model and beamforming technique to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) with the constraint on total transmit power. In MDCM, the transmission rate is not limited by the user with the minimum channel quality any more. And the beamforming technique can enhance the signal strength of the weakest user. In this paper, a two-step suboptimal scheme is studied. Firstly, the beamforming weighted vector (BWV) is obtained by a vector splitting algorithm, and then the power and subcarrier allocation is realized by fractional programming and subgradient method. Numerical results reveal that the proposed scheme can achieve near optimal EE and greatly improve the EE compared with two spectrum-efficient schemes. In addition, the energy-efficient scheme can render a good performance in EE as well as throughput when the total transmit power is small.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13902134","htmlLink":"/document/6666699/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient multicast resource allocation based on beamforming technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient multicast resource allocation based on beamforming technique","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3208ou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109335S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6666707,"authors":[{"name":"Kimmo Hiltunen","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, NomadicLab, FI, Finland"],"firstName":"Kimmo","lastName":"Hiltunen","id":"37284780200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666707","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":654},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utilizing eNodeB sleep mode to improve the energy-efficiency of dense LTE networks","abstract":"This study evaluates the performance of a scheme, where idle capacity cells are put into sleep mode to save energy. The evaluation is performed for a few different LTE network densification alternatives, and the network performance is compared from the daily energy consumption point of view. The obtained results indicate that the introduction of the sleep mode scheme results in 42-62% lower daily energy consumption, depending on the network densification alternative. Furthermore, the evaluated heterogeneous network deployments are found to be more energy-efficient than the densified macro deployment, which is a clear difference compared to scenarios without any energy saving schemes. If the sleep mode deployment is compared to a scheme, where underutilized capacity cells are completely switched off, the gain becomes equal to 26-43%. The results demonstrate also that the network energy consumption can be further reduced with the help of fast cell DTX. For example, if a fast cell DTX scheme reducing the idle state power consumption by 50% is assumed, the daily energy consumption becomes 31-37% lower than without fast cell DTX. Finally, the combination of fast cell DTX and sleep mode deployment results in 63-75% lower daily energy consumption compared to scenarios without any special energy saving schemes.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"3249","endPage":"3253","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666707.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666707","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Energy consumption","Switches","Energy efficiency","Conferences","Mobile communication","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","energy consumption","Long Term Evolution","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eNodeB sleep mode","energy-efficiency","dense LTE network","heterogeneous network deployment","energy saving scheme","network energy consumption","power consumption","fast cell DTX scheme","densified macrodeployment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","network densification","heterogeneous networks","sleep mode","power consumption","energy saving"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Utilizing eNodeB sleep mode to improve the energy-efficiency of dense LTE networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901843","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666707/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666707/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilizing eNodeB sleep mode to improve the energy-efficiency of dense LTE networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3249hiltunen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036148S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6666709,"authors":[{"name":"Elias Chavarria-Reyes","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Chavarria-Reyes","id":"37085728688"},{"name":"Ian F.

Nearly 80% of the energy in cellular systems is consumed by the Radio Access Network (RAN). In recent years, much research has been done to reduce the energy consumption in the RAN. However, existing models fail to capture the spatiotemporal variability of traffic demands, bit rate and power requirements, as well as the peculiarities in the energy consumption from different hardware components in a base station (BS). In this paper, a new RAN energy consumption model for multi-layer infrastructure-based heterogeneous wireless systems (IbHWS) is proposed. It captures all the aforementioned factors and accurately addresses the characteristics of IbHWS, where cellular systems are a particular case. A low-complexity algorithm is proposed to minimize the RAN's energy consumption, and to satisfy all traffic demands in space and time.

The target capacity of the proposed system is the transmission of 3 million message data (MD) or more within one hour. To control random access of mobile terminal (MT), Frame Slotted ALOHA is used. Frame Slotted ALOHA cannot provide optimum control, since the hub station (HUB) does not know the number of MTs. For realizing large capacity, we propose Frame Slotted ALOHA with Flag Method in which the HUB can estimate the number of MT quickly. The proposed Flag Method is divided into two modes. The send flag mode can estimate the number of MT within a short time. The send message data mode can control random packet access using estimated number of MD in send flag mode. Computer simulation shows that it is possible to accommodate 3 million MD by using the proposed Flag Method within 48m 19s.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666713","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666713.pdf","startPage":"3280","endPage":"3285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-capacity QZSS location and short message system using Frame Slotted ALOHA with Flag Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666713/","displayDocTitle":"Large-capacity QZSS location and short message system using Frame Slotted ALOHA with Flag Method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902248","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666713/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-capacity QZSS location and short message system using Frame Slotted ALOHA with Flag Method","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3280takahashi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067755S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666717,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, the performance analysis of CRNs with VoIP traffic considering either Poisson or ON/OFF models for the primary arrival characterization is evaluated and compared. To provide a fair basis of comparison for the ON/OFF and Poisson arrival models, the same both resource utilization factor and mean white space duration in both arrival models are considered. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this performance comparison of CRNs with VoIP traffic under these arrivals models has not been reported in the literature yet. Numerical results show that system performance metrics (new session blocking probability, packet dropping probability, and packet delay) are more pessimistic under the Poisson model than under the ON/OFF model. This is due to the fact that the variance of the white space duration is greater in the Poisson model than in the ON/OFF model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666717/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13901991","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666717/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of VoIP cognitive radio networks under On/Off and poisson primary arrivals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of VoIP cognitive radio networks under On/Off and poisson primary arrivals","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3302castellanoslopez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069037S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666718,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Alsohaily","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Alsohaily","id":"37075882000"},{"name":"Elvino S.

However, care must be taken to ensure that interference from autonomously deployed small cells is tightly controlled when developing such policies. This paper presents a dynamic spectrum access framework that enables small cells employing a specific Radio Access Technology (RAT) to access the spectrum allocated to other RATs as secondary users without degrading the performance of primary RATs. Secondary small cells opportunistically access unutilized spectrum in their coverage area and the protection of primary RATs is achieved by preventing secondary small cells from accessing spectrum when a potential interference scenario is detected. A system where HSPA and LTE-Advanced are co-deployed is considered. Simulation results show that substantial performance gains for both RATs are achieved by increasing spectrum utilization through secondary access for small cells. Furthermore, gains are achieved without degrading the performance of primary RATs.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666718","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666718.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666718","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"3308","endPage":"3312","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access for small cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access for small cells","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666718/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666718/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901738","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access for small cells","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3308alsohaily.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065012S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6666720,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Gao","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Gao","id":"38547959400"},{"name":"Wenjun Xu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404292300"},{"name":"Shengyu Li","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Shengyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37071823500"},{"name":"Kai Niu","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Niu","id":"37284274700"},{"name":"Jiaru Lin","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"],"firstName":"Jiaru","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404490700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666720","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Sensors","Cognitive radio","Programming","Interference constraints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","gradient methods","integer programming","nonlinear programming","radio spectrum management","resource allocation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imperfect spectrum sensing","energy efficient resource allocation strategy","OFDM-based cognitive radio networks","interference model","sensing errors","multiuser CR system","total transmission power budget","primary user interference constraints","PU","mixed integer nonlinear programming issue","resource allocation scheme","subgradient method","fractional programming","optimal power allocation algorithm","suboptimal subcarrier assignment"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the energy efficient resource allocation strategy for OFDM-based cognitive radio (CR) networks with imperfect spectrum sensing. The interference model taking the sensing errors into account is formulated at first. And the objective is to maximize the energy efficiency of the multiuser CR system subject to the total transmission power budget and each primary user's (PU) interference constraints. As the primal problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming issue, we will separate the resource allocation scheme into two steps, i.e., subcarrier assignment and power allocation. After the suboptimal subcarrier assignment, an optimal power allocation algorithm is proposed based on fractional programming and sub-gradient method. The simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme can achieve higher energy efficiency than the one maximizing the capacity of the CR networks. Meanwhile, it can protect the normal communication of each PU compared to the scheme without considering sensing errors.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666720","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666720.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666720","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"3318","endPage":"3322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient resource allocation for cognitive radio networks with imperfect spectrum sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient resource allocation for cognitive radio networks with imperfect spectrum sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666720/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666720/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901774","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient resource allocation for cognitive radio networks with imperfect spectrum sensing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3318gao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091186S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666721,"authors":[{"name":"Weng Chon Ao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California"],"firstName":"Weng Chon","lastName":"Ao","id":"37540936800"},{"name":"Shin-Ming Cheng","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, TW"],"firstName":"Shin-Ming","lastName":"Cheng"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666721","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Interference","Ad hoc networks","Cognitive radio","Fading","Quality of service","Information rates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","quality of service","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop transmission delay","cognitive radio ad hoc networks","CRN","medium access delay","opportunistic transmissions","secondary users","SU","interference constraints","primary receivers","primary transmitters","concurrent secondary transmitters","retransmission delay","hop count","end-to-end route","delay QoS provisioning","baseline performance analysis","routing design"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A lower bound on multi-hop transmission delay in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","endPage":"3327","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666721.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666721","startPage":"3323","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666721","abstract":"This paper analyzes the delay of multi-hop transmissions in cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRNs) to investigate the performance of routings in CRN. Compared to routing in ad hoc networks, additional medium access delay is introduced in CRN since opportunistic transmissions of secondary users (SUs) should not violate the interference constraints at primary receivers. Moreover, additional retransmission delay occurs in CRN because received signals at SUs are interfered with by both primary transmitters and concurrent secondary transmitters. We propose an analytically tractable model to investigate routings in CRN considering medium access delay, retransmission delay and the hop count of the end-to-end route. Through optimizing the number of hops of the end-to-end route, a lower bound on the end-to-end packet transmission delay is developed, which facilitates delay QoS provisioning and rate-delay trade-off in CRN. Consequently, this research serves as the valid framework for baseline performance analysis and offers novel avenues to routing design in CRN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13901857","htmlLink":"/document/6666721/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A lower bound on multi-hop transmission delay in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A lower bound on multi-hop transmission delay in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3323ao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062939S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6666722,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Werthmann","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks and Computer Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Werthmann","id":"38267720700"},{"name":"Heidrun Grob-Lipski","affiliation":["ALCATEL-LUCENT DEUTSCHLAND AG, BELL LABS, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Heidrun","lastName":"Grob-Lipski","id":"38282559500"},{"name":"Magnus Proebster","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks and Computer Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Proebster","id":"37704590900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666722","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":627},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Load modeling","Interference","Multiplexing","Base stations","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","cellular radio","cloud computing","multiplexing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing gain assessment","baseband computation units","4G cellular networks","mobile user traffic load","wireless network","cloud computing","virtualization techniques","operation cost reduction","dynamic systems","baseband processing functions","multiple radio sites","traffic heterogeneity","data traffic","resource utilization","spatial user distribution","single cloud base station"]}],"abstract":"The tremendous increase of mobile user traffic load within the last few years forces us to efficiently use the wireless network and processing resources.

Adaptive control CRE is proposed with the use of an optimal combination of two different cell selection offsets (CSOs) for each user equipment (UE), although the conventional CRE provides a fixed CSO for all UEs. The control algorithm of the proposed method is clarified from an overall system perspective. We also discuss ways to optimize the proposed method by evaluating the average user throughput and the cell edge user throughput. Computer simulation results are provided as parameters of the combination of two different CSOs under the condition of a clustered distribution of UEs. We confirmed that the proposed method can improve cell edge user throughput, while maintaining the average user throughput by choosing the optimal combination of two different CSOs. This will provide a remarkably effective solution for HetNet in LTE-Advanced and beyond.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666723","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666723.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666723","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"3334","endPage":"3338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter optimization for adaptive control CRE in HetNet","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Parameter optimization for adaptive control CRE in HetNet","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666723/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666723/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901859","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter optimization for adaptive control CRE in HetNet","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3334kikuchi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047609S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6666728,"authors":[{"name":"Ehab Salahat","affiliation":["Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Ehab","lastName":"Salahat","id":"37070010000"},{"name":"Ibrahim Abualhaol","affiliation":["Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Abualhaol","id":"37294389700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666728","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":360},"abstract":"This paper presents simple and accurate approximation of the normalized incomplete upper and lower gamma functions that frequently appear in Nakagami-m fading channels. Based on the proposed approximation and in conjunction with the approximation of the Q-function proposed by Chiani, Dardari, and Simon [1], simple and accurate generalized closed-form expressions for the average Bit Error Rate (BER) over Nakagami-m fading channels are derived for Selection Combining (SC) and Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) receivers for any number of diversity branches. The derived expressions are applicable for any coherent modulation scheme with any constellation order for both Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels. Monte Carlo simulation of the average BER curves for both SC and MRC using different digital modulation schemes with different constellation order over Nakagami-m fading channels are compared with the closed-forms. The closed-forms numerical results coincide with the Monte Carlo simulation for different values of the fading parameter m. These expressions are simple and can be used to analyze the average BER over Nakagami-m fading channels with high accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on

unprecedented level. Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard and its improved version LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) are two technology standards developed to cope with high levels of mobile data traffic demand. However, traffic and revenue disparity still is a reality, suggesting that traditional network deployment methods - based mainly on macro cellular sites - might prove to be cost ineffective in the long term. From another perspective, and increasingly important for mobile network operators, revenue is also a function of each mobile network deployment's sustainability. This work aims to comprehensively elaborate on those matters by presenting four specific scenarios with a comparative analysis of both macro and femtocell deployments (single and both technology networks). For each scenario, capacity, cost effectiveness and expected carbon emissions are the evaluated key indicators. This kind of analysis provides mobile networks operators with relevant information, enabling them to sustainably adapt business and provisioning models as well as network deployment strategies to current and future technological standards, while minimizing capital and operational expenditure (CAPEX/OPEX). The main contribution is that in short term, mixed macro and femtocell deployment scenarios are the most cost effective and sustainable option, while in mid to long term, as data traffic demand rises, femtocell deployments become the most sustainable, not only from economical and environmental points of view, but also from network coverage stand point.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell deployment in LTE-A networks: A sustainability, economical and capacity analysis","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666740","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666740.pdf","startPage":"3423","endPage":"3427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell deployment in LTE-A networks: A sustainability, economical and capacity analysis","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666740/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901797","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell deployment in LTE-A networks: A sustainability, economical and capacity analysis","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3423vaz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064972S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6666743,"authors":[{"name":"Ole Gr\u00f8ndalen","affiliation":["Telenor ASA, Fornebu, Norway"],"firstName":"Ole","lastName":"Gr\u00f8ndalen","id":"37395101500"},{"name":"Markku L\u00e4htenoja","affiliation":["Telenor ASA, Fornebu, Norway"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"L\u00e4htenoja","id":"37086726196"},{"name":"Per Hjalmar Lehne","affiliation":["Telenor ASA, Fornebu, Norway"],"firstName":"Per Hjalmar","lastName":"Lehne","id":"37331153400"},{"name":"Richard Mackenzie","affiliation":["BT Technology, Service & Operations, UK"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Mackenzie","id":"37410661100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666743","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Mobile communication","Business","Broadband communication","Subscriptions","Quality of service","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive femtocells","business case analysis","fixed broadband operator","FBO","mobile broadband service","collective coverage","accumulated cash flow","sensitivity analysis","OPEX","operational expenditure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Business case","cognitive radio","femtocell"]}],"abstract":"The viability of providing mobile broadband with cognitive femtocells is evaluated by performing a business case analysis for a scenario where a Fixed Broadband Operator (FBO) uses this approach to extend its offering to include a mobile broadband service. The collective coverage provided by randomly located cognitive femtocells is determined and used to estimate how much of the traffic that will go over the cognitive femtocells and therefore generate revenues for the FBO. With the assumptions made, the cognitive femtocell based mobile broadband service is found to be a reasonable business case for the FBO. The investments over the first few years are moderate and the accumulated cash flow becomes positive after four years.

To better optimize ITS based-on Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) networks, the soft handover management is an indispensable technology. In this paper, a dual handover prioritization (DHP) scheme which is composed of two layers prioritization design is proposed to guarantee different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of multi-services in ITS, where the first layer is operated by reserving dedicated channels and building handover buffer for handover calls to guarantee the QoS of handover calls from the macro-perspective. And the second layer is executed by scheduling the waiting handover calls according to its priority level which is proportional to its QoS requirement from the micro-perspective. Then, an analytical model is built to evaluate the performance of the proposed DHP scheme in ITS based-on WCDMA. Results show the superiority of the proposed DHP scheme compared with conventional soft handover schemes in ITS based-on WCDMA.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666744","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","startPage":"3445","endPage":"3449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priority based soft-handover scheme for multi-services in Intelligent Transportation Systems over WCDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Priority based soft-handover scheme for multi-services in Intelligent Transportation Systems over WCDMA networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666744/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13901994","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6666744/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Priority based soft-handover scheme for multi-services in Intelligent Transportation Systems over WCDMA networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3445sun.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051213S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6666773,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Chen","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications Joint Research Institute for Signal and Image Processing, The University of Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085474190"},{"name":"Nikola Serafimovski","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications Joint Research Institute for Signal and Image Processing, The University of Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Serafimovski","id":"37704270000"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications Joint Research Institute for Signal and Image Processing, The University of Edinburgh EH9 3JL, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6235-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"6666773","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":483},"abstract":"Interference coordination in optical wireless cellular networks using different frequency reuse techniques are discussed and compared in this paper. On the one hand, full frequency reuse maximises the system throughput at the cost of poor cell-edge user performance. On the other hand, cluster-based static resource partitioning offers good cell-edge user performance at the cost of low system throughput. Fractional frequency reuse (FFR) is introduced as a compromise between cell-edge user performance and the system throughput with low system complexity. Simulation results show that a guaranteed user throughput of 5.6 Mbps and an average area spectral efficiency (ASE) of 0.3389 bps/Hz/m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n are achieved by the FFR optical wireless system with appropriate power control factors.

is performed for optical wireless communication (OWC). Line-of-sight (LOS) channel conditions are considered in an indoor downlink scenario. The bit-error ratio (BER) performance is investigated in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel under the conditions of equal spectral and power efficiency. For DCO-OFDMA and 1-D OCDMA, the negative-level clipping effect and multiple-access interference (MAI) are considered, respectively. For the OCDMA scheme, the categories of optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) and unipolar Walsh-Hadamard codes (WHCs) are employed. The time-division multiple-access (TDMA) is also represented in the context of synchronous OCDMA by the use of identity matrices. In order to enhance the 1-D OCDMA spectral efficiency, unipolar M-ary pulse amplitude modulation (M-PAM) is employed. The BER performance versus the average electrical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per bit is illustrated both for the single and the multiple-user communication using Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666775","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656121/6666091/06666775.pdf","startPage":"3605","endPage":"3609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2013.6666775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison between DCO-OFDMA and synchronous one-dimensional OCDMA for optical wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666775/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison between DCO-OFDMA and synchronous one-dimensional OCDMA for optical wireless communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13902059","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666775/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison between DCO-OFDMA and synchronous one-dimensional OCDMA for optical wireless communications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p3605fakidis.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078798S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656121","isNumber":"6666091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656121","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6666091","articleId":"6666775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6666838,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A new formulation for maximum capacity flow of the transmission lines was developed and used in truncating the state space to identify the definite success and definite failure subspaces. A new algorithm based on \u201cdirected\u201d Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) was developed to search for the designated success or failure states in the remaining part of the state space. The remaining subspace is system dependent, and in case of systems with high capacity and reliability transmission lines in comparison with generation and loading levels, the effect of this subspace on system reliability can be ignored without causing any significant error. This method is very simple and straight forward, yet it reduces the computational time significantly. The method progresses by calculating the total available power carrying capability at every bus and between buses for every system state. Incidence matrix technique was used in building Line Capacity Matrix (LCM). From the LCM and system state (Generation-Transmission-Load), reliability indices can be calculated. This method was applied on two systems, the IEEE RTS and the modified IEEE RTS and it gave promising results.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2013.6666951","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 North American Power Symposium (NAPS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2013.6666951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666822","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 North American Power Symposium (NAPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656123/6666822/06666951.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite power system reliability assessment using maximum capacity flow and directed Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666951/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Composite power system reliability assessment using maximum capacity flow and directed Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666951/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13916292","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite power system reliability assessment using maximum capacity flow and directed Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Manhattan, KS, USA","sourcePdf":"1170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066945S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656123","isNumber":"6666822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656123","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6666822","articleId":"6666951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":6666953,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Benidris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Benidris","id":"37887724200"},{"name":"Salem Elsaiah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Salem","lastName":"Elsaiah","id":"37887722700"},{"name":"Joydeep Mitra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Joydeep","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37354016900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1255-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6666953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system reliability","Reliability","Indexes","Monte Carlo methods","Linear programming","Interconnected systems","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","particle swarm optimisation","power system reliability","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte-Carlo simulation","IEEE RTS","objective function","weighting factors","BPSO","composite system reliability indices evaluation","dynamically directed particle swarm optimization","composite system reliability assessment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Directed BPSO","reliability indices","composite systems","Monte Carlo Simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6666953","abstract":"This paper introduces a novel technique to evaluate composite system reliability indices using dynamically directed Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO). A key point in using BPSO in power system reliability evaluation lies in selecting the weighting factors associated with the objective function. Such weighting factors are, in fact, system dependent, thereby their appropriate values should be carefully selected in order to prevent the swarm from being trapped to one corner of the state space. In this context, the work presented here proposes a solution method to adjust such weighting factors in a dynamic fashion so that the swarm would always fly on the entire search space rather of being trapped to one corner of the search space. Therefore, in every single iteration, reliability indices are tackled and weighting factors are tuned up accordingly. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated on the IEEE RTS. In this test case, it has been shown that the results obtained by the proposed method correspond closely to those obtained using Monte-Carlo simulation, while requiring lower computational burden.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2013.6666953","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 North American Power Symposium (NAPS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2013.6666953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666822","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 North American Power Symposium (NAPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6656123/6666822/06666953.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite system reliability assessment using dynamically directed Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6666953/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Composite system reliability assessment using dynamically directed Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6666953/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13916300","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite system reliability assessment using dynamically directed Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Manhattan, KS, USA","sourcePdf":"1172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053713S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6656123","isNumber":"6666822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6656123","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6666822","articleId":"6666953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":6668861,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["ICTEAM Institute, Universit\u00e9 Catholiaue de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6689285/6668861/6668861-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Wang (SM'12) received Ph.D from Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Belgium in 2012, Doctor of Engineering and Bachelor (summa cum laude) degrees from Zhejiang University, China, in 2006 and 2001, respectively.

The EE is evaluated by the total energy consumption for transmitting per message bit. Three channel cases are considered, namely static channel with channel state information available at transmitter (CSIT), fast-varying (FV) channel with channel distribution information available at transmitter (CDIT), and FV channel with CSIT. The link's circuit power is modeled as \u03c1+\u03ba\u03c6(R) Watt, where \u03c1>0 and \u03ba\u22650 are two constants and \u03c6(R) is a general increasing and convex function of the transmission rate R\u22650. For all the three channel cases, the tradeoff between the EE and SE is studied. It is shown that the EE improves strictly as the SE increases from 0 to the optimum SE, and then strictly degrades as the SE increases beyond the optimum SE. The impact of \u03ba, \u03c1 and other system parameters on the optimum EE and corresponding SE is investigated to obtain insight. Some of the important and interesting results for all the channel cases include: (1) when \u03ba increases the SE corresponding to the optimum EE should keep unchanged if \u03c6(R)=R, but reduced if \u03c6(R) is strictly convex of R; (2) when the rate-independent circuit power \u03c1 increases, the SE corresponding to the optimum EE has to be increased. A polynomial-complexity algorithm is developed with the bisection method to find the optimum SE. The insight is corroborated and the optimum EE for the three cases are compared by simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Optimum Energy Efficiency for Flat-Fading Channels with Rate-dependent Circuit Power","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.111013.130150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6689285/06668861.pdf","startPage":"4910","endPage":"4921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.111013.130150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6668861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"On the Optimum Energy Efficiency for Flat-Fading Channels with Rate-dependent Circuit Power","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6668861/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13990148","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Optimum Energy Efficiency for Flat-Fading Channels with Rate-dependent Circuit Power","sourcePdf":"4910-tc1312-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096882S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6689285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6689285","articleId":"6668861","onlineDate":"18 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6668864,"authors":[{"name":"Zunaira Babar","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6689285/6668864/6668864-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zunaira Babar received her B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Science & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2008 and M.Sc. degree (Distinction) in wireless communications from the University of Southampton, UK, in 2011.

In this work, genetically engineered Escherichia coli bacteria were maintained in a microfluidic device where their response to a chemical stimulus was examined over time. The bacteria serve as a communication receiver where a simple modulation such as on-off keying (OOK) is achievable, although it suffers from very poor data-rates. We explore an alternative communication strategy called time-elapse communication (TEC) that uses the time period between signals to encode information. We identify the limitations of TEC under practical non-zero error conditions and propose an advanced communication strategy called smart time-elapse communication (TEC-SMART) that achieves over a 10x improvement in data-rate over OOK. We derive the capacity of TEC and provide a theoretical maximum data-rate that can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668865/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","volume":"61","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13990124","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","publicationDate":"December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6668865/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-Elapse Communication: Bacterial Communication on a Microfluidic Chip","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Elapse Communication: Bacterial Communication on a Microfluidic Chip","sourcePdf":"5139-tc1312-bhuvana.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114115S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6689285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6689285","articleId":"6668865","onlineDate":"03 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6668867,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolo Michelusi","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6689285/6668867/6668867-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicol\u00f2 Michelusi (S'09, M'13) received the B.Sc.

However, irreversible degradation mechanisms jeopardize battery lifetime, calling for intelligent management policies, which minimize the impact of these phenomena while guaranteeing a minimum Quality of Service (QoS). This paper explores a mathematical characterization of these devices, focusing on the interplay between the battery discharge policy and the irreversible degradation of the storage capacity. We propose a stochastic Markov chain framework, suitable for policy optimization, which captures the degradation status of the battery. We present a general result of Markov chains, which exploits the timescale separation between the communication time-slot of the device and the battery degradation process, and enables an efficient optimization. We show that this model fits well the behavior of real batteries for what concerns their storage capacity degradation over time. We demonstrate that a degradation-aware policy significantly improves the lifetime of the sensor compared to \"greedy\" policies, while guaranteeing the minimum required QoS. Finally, a simple heuristic policy, which never discharges the battery below a given threshold, is shown to achieve near-optimal performance in terms of battery lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.111113.130022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6689285/06668867.pdf","startPage":"4934","endPage":"4947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.111113.130022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Management Policies for Harvesting-Based Wireless Sensor Devices with Battery Degradation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6668867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668867/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Management Policies for Harvesting-Based Wireless Sensor Devices with Battery Degradation","volume":"61","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13990122","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6668867/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Management Policies for Harvesting-Based Wireless Sensor Devices with Battery Degradation","sourcePdf":"4934-tc1312-nicolo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113515S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6689285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6689285","articleId":"6668867","onlineDate":"18 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6668868,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojia Lu","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6689285/6668868/6668868-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaojia Lu received his M.Sc degree in electrical engineering from the University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland in 2006, and defended his doctoral thesis from the same university in 2013.

We propose two bit loading algorithms, in which the data rate of users is iteratively increased until the rate targets are satisfied. A joint power control, BSC selection and beamforming design problem with fixed rate allocation per subcarrier is optimally solved in every iteration. A bit switching (BSW) algorithm is further proposed in order to search for better rate allocations. The performances of the proposed algorithms are compared to upper and lower bounds achieved by the capacity-achieving scheme and equal rate allocation over subcarriers (ER), respectively. Simulation results show that proposed algorithms achieve significantly better performance than the ER scheme.

To reduce interference on the primary network, a simple yet effective back-off control power method is applied for secondary multihop networks. For a given threshold of interference probability at the primary network, we derive the maximum back-off control power coefficient, which provides the best performance for secondary multihop networks. Moreover, it is shown that the number of hops for secondary network is upper-bounded under the fixed settings of the primary network. For secondary multihop networks, new exact and asymptotic expressions for outage probability (OP), bit error rate (BER) and ergodic capacity over Rayleigh fading channels are derived. Based on the asymptotic OP and BEP, a pivotal conclusion is reached that the secondary multihop network offers the same diversity order as compared with the network without back off. Finally, we verify the performance analysis through various numerical examples which confirm the correctness of our analysis for many channel and system settings and provide new insight into the design and optimization of cognitive multihop networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.110413.130167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6689285/06668869.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.110413.130167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689285","startPage":"4864","endPage":"4873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Cognitive Underlay Multihop Networks with Imperfect Channel State Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6668869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Cognitive Underlay Multihop Networks with Imperfect Channel State Information","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13990133","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6668869/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Cognitive Underlay Multihop Networks with Imperfect Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"4864-tc1312-bao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066593S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6689285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6689285","articleId":"6668869","onlineDate":"18 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6668872,"authors":[{"name":"Trivesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"firstName":"Trivesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38505447200"},{"name":"A.

This paper investigates the relationship between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) for a virtual-MIMO system that has one destination and one relay using compress-and-forward (CF) cooperation. To capture the cost of cooperation, the power allocation (between the transmitter and the relay) and the bandwidth allocation (between the data and cooperation channels) are studied. This paper derives a tight upper bound for the overall system EE as a function of SE, which exhibits good accuracy for a wide range of SE values. The EE upper bound is used to formulate an EE optimization problem. Given a target SE, the optimal power and bandwidth allocation can be derived such that the overall EE is maximized. Results indicate that the EE performance of virtual-MIMO is sensitive to many factors, including resource-allocation schemes and channel characteristics. When an out-of-band cooperation channel is considered, the performance of virtual-MIMO is close to that of the MIMO case in terms of EE. Considering a shared-band cooperation channel, virtual-MIMO with optimal power and bandwidth allocation is more energy efficient than the noncooperation case under most SE values.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2291435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6832681/06668876.pdf","startPage":"2272","endPage":"2283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2291435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficiency Analysis and Optimization for Virtual-MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6668876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668876/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficiency Analysis and Optimization for Virtual-MIMO Systems","volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2014","accessionNumber":"14379498","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6668876/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Huawei Technologies Company, Ltd., China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficiency Analysis and Optimization for Virtual-MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-dianati-2291435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130559S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6668876","onlineDate":"18 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6668877,"authors":[{"name":"Maria E.

One of the main challenges is to enable UAVs to become as autonomous as possible. A vital component toward this direction is the robust and accurate estimation of the egomotion of the UAV. Egomotion estimation can be enhanced by equipping the UAV with a video camera, which enables a vision-based egomotion estimation. However, the high computational requirements of vision-based egomotion algorithms, combined with the real-time performance and low power consumption requirements that are related to such an application, cannot be met by general-purpose processing units. This paper presents a system architecture that employs a field-programmable gate array as the main processing platform connected to a low-power CPU that targets the problem of vision-based egomotion estimation in a UAV. The performance evaluation of the proposed system, using real data captured by a UAV's on-board camera, demonstrates the ability of the system to render accurate estimation of the egomotion parameters, meeting at the same time the real-time requirements imposed by the application.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2291356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2291356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6824288/06668877.pdf","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6824288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-Based Egomotion Estimation on FPGA for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Navigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Vision-Based Egomotion Estimation on FPGA for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Navigation","volume":"24","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14349455","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6668877/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000396","fundingName":"Technology Strategy Board"},{"fundingName":"Barnard Microsystems Ltd."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-Based Egomotion Estimation on FPGA for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Navigation","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-bouganis-2291356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103003S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6824288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6824288","articleId":"6668877","onlineDate":"03 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6668882,"authors":[{"name":"Simranjit Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Thapar University, Patiala, India"],"firstName":"Simranjit","lastName":"Singh","id":"37066781000"},{"name":"R.

It is conventionally estimated by noninvasively measuring central and peripheral blood pressure (BP) and/or velocity (BV) waveforms and then detecting the foot-to-foot time delay between the waveforms wherein wave reflection is presumed absent. We developed techniques for improved estimation of PWV from the same waveforms. The techniques effectively estimate PWV from the entire waveforms, rather than just their feet, by mathematically eliminating the reflected wave via an arterial tube-load model. In this way, the techniques may be more robust to artifact while revealing the true PWV in absence of wave reflection. We applied the techniques to estimate aortic PWV from simultaneously and sequentially measured central and peripheral BP waveforms and simultaneously measured central BV and peripheral BP waveforms from 17 anesthetized animals during diverse interventions that perturbed BP widely. Since BP is the major acute determinant of aortic PWV, especially under anesthesia wherein vasomotor tone changes are minimal, we evaluated the techniques in terms of the ability of their PWV estimates to track the acute BP changes in each subject. Overall, the PWV estimates of the techniques tracked the BP changes better than those of the conventional technique (e.g., diastolic BP root-mean-squared errors of 3.4 versus 5.2 mmHg for the simultaneous BP waveforms and 7.0 versus 12.2 mmHg for the BV and BP waveforms (p <; 0.02)). With further testing, the arterial tube-load model-based PWV estimation techniques may afford more accurate arterial stiffness monitoring in hypertensive and other patients.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2013.2291385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6740863/06668883.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2013.2291385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Pulse Wave Velocity Estimation Using an Arterial Tube-Load Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6668883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668883/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Pulse Wave Velocity Estimation Using an Arterial Tube-Load Model","volume":"61","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14111573","pubMedId":"24263016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6668883/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Pulse Wave Velocity Estimation Using an Arterial Tube-Load Model","sourcePdf":"tbme-mukkamala-2291385-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141794S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6740863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6740863","articleId":"6668883","onlineDate":"03 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6668888,"authors":[{"name":"Ya-Xiong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6777358/6668888/6668888-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ya-Xiong Wang (S'13) received the B.Eng. degree in mechanical engineering from Chongqing University of Technology, Chongqing, China, in 2010, and the M.

The boost converter is inherently a highly nonlinear system that displays interconnected state variables and system parameter variations due to load change with input disturbances. Therefore, a robust control scheme is required to cope with these characteristics. The main objective of controlling the capacitor output voltage is to keep the output voltage constant under input voltage variations with fast response, and little overshoot and ripples. To satisfy this objective, a robust control with time-delay concept is introduced. The control utilizes time-delayed switching input to the converter, as well as output current and voltage variables, to replace the unknown dynamics and disturbance. To prove the effectiveness of the algorithm, two operating point variations are considered: variations in source voltage, and changes in output load. Simulations are performed using MATLAB/Simulink to show the effectiveness of the algorithm by choosing the output voltage lift, drop, settling time, and ripples as the system performance criteria. Then, a comparison of the results is made of the proportional and integral control, and the sliding mode control. An experimental test is also performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2290764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6777358/06668888.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2290764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777358","startPage":"4829","endPage":"4837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Time-Delay Control for the DC\u2013DC Boost Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6668888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Time-Delay Control for the DC\u2013DC Boost Converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14181269","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6668888/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Time-Delay Control for the DC\u2013DC Boost Converter","sourcePdf":"tie-kim-2290764-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064335S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6777358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6777358","articleId":"6668888","onlineDate":"18 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6668914,"authors":[{"name":"James Haydn Nelson","affiliation":["National Instruments, Inc., Austin, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"James Haydn","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37086632436"},{"name":"Alejandro Buritica","affiliation":["National Instruments, Inc., Austin, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Alejandro","lastName":"Buritica","id":"37086633120"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"6668914","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Power generation","Radio frequency","Modulation","Manufacturing processes","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application note","power search","power servo","device under test","test system","nonlinear behavior","production testing","manufacturing process","amplifier gain","modulation accuracy","spectral quality","power efficiency","nonlinear properties","PA","RF power amplifiers","FPGA based instrumentation","enhanced RF power leveling"]}],"abstract":"RF power amplifiers (PAs) exhibit nonlinear properties as their output power increases.

Then, the calculation results under various voltages in no-load condition are compared with the experiment data, which provides the basis for the further performance analysis and motor design.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2290762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777358","startPage":"4531","endPage":"4538","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6777358/06668938.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation and Analysis of Can Losses of Canned Induction Motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6668938/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Calculation and Analysis of Can Losses of Canned Induction Motor","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14181275","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation and Analysis of Can Losses of Canned Induction Motor","sourcePdf":"tie-liang-2290762-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066598S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6777358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6777358","articleId":"6668938","onlineDate":"18 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6668957,"authors":[{"name":"Yejun Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Yejun","lastName":"Fu","id":"37086642747"},{"name":"Xiupu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiupu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291965600"},{"name":"Bouchaib Hraimel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Bouchaib","lastName":"Hraimel","id":"37319521500"},{"name":"Taijun Liu","affiliation":["Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Taijun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539601900"},{"name":"Dongya Shen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Dongya","lastName":"Shen","id":"37279369300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"6668957","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5429},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mach-Zehnder interferometers","Interferometers","Broadband communication","Optical harmonic generation","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical fibers","High speed optical techniques","Optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro-optical modulation","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","lithium compounds","Mach-Zehnder interferometers","optical harmonic generation","optical transfer function","phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multioctave bandwidth","spurious free dynamic range","Mach-Zehnder modulators","bias control techniques","broadband photonic analog links","quadrature bias points","millimeter-wave generation","MZM transfer function","cosine transfer function","high transfer-function nonlinearity","optical signal modulation","optical subcarrier modulation","optical frequency multiplication","optical harmonic generation","RF photonics","nonlinear transfer function","output optical field","dielectric properties","indium phosphide","gallium arsenide","lithium niobate","phase-modulated light","intensity-modulated light","electrical signal","photonic applications","optical modulator","driving voltage","modulation bandwidth","high-speed digital optical fiber communication systems","LiNbO3","GaAs","InP"]}],"abstract":"The Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) has been widely used for broadband photonic analog links and high-speed digital optical fiber communication systems because it possesses large modulation bandwidth, low driving voltage, and low chirp. The MZM is a very important optical modulator for photonic applications. In an MZM, the input light is split into two paths, each of which is modulated by an electrical signal. Then the two arms are combined to generate an intensity-modulated light or a phase-modulated light at the output of the MZM. An MZM can be made of lithium niobate (LiNbO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n), gallium arsenide (GaAs), or indium phosphide (InP), materials that exhibit some anisotropy in their dielectric properties. Theoretically, the relation of output optical field and driving voltage is a cosine function, i.e., nonlinear transfer function. For RF photonics, the MZM has typically two applications: optical harmonic generation for optical frequency multiplication and optical subcarrier modulation for optical signal modulation. For optical frequency multiplication, high transfer-function nonlinearity is preferred. In contrast, high transfer-function linearity is preferred for optical subcarrier modulation. It is well known that a cosine transfer function can present high or low nonlinearity dependent on operation voltage. Specifically, bias voltages determine the degree of nonlinearity or linearity of the MZM transfer function. For optical frequency multiplication such as millimeter-wave generation, the MZM should be biased at some specific bias points, such as minimum transmission, maximum transmission, and quadrature bias points, to enhance nonlinearity [1]?[2]. For optical subcarrier modulation, biasing an MZM in its linear region such as quadrature bias points allows transmitting broadband RF signals with multioctave bandwidth and improves spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). Therefore, care must be taken to maintain and control the MZM bias point for a specific application.","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2013.2280332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6668/6668880/06668957.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6668880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2013.2280332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mach-Zehnder: A Review of Bias Control Techniques for Mach-Zehnder Modulators in Photonic Analog Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6668957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Mach-Zehnder: A Review of Bias Control Techniques for Mach-Zehnder Modulators in Photonic Analog Links","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668957/","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13914134","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6668957/","volume":"14","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mach-Zehnder: A Review of Bias Control Techniques for Mach-Zehnder Modulators in Photonic Analog Links","sourcePdf":"14mmm07-fu-2280332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057024S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"6668880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6668880","articleId":"6668957","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6668968,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Roblin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Roblin","id":"37299531300"},{"name":"Christophe Quindroit","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Quindroit","id":"37572958600"},{"name":"Naveen Naraharisetti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Naraharisetti","id":"38362684200"},{"name":"Shahin Gheitanchi","affiliation":["Altera Europe, Holmers Farm Way, High Wycombe, Buckinghamsire, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Shahin","lastName":"Gheitanchi","id":"37540915200"},{"name":"Mike Fitton","affiliation":["Altera Corp. 101 Innovation Dr., San Jose, California, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Fitton","id":"37063561100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"6668968","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1327},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"abstract":"With the explosive growth of the smartphone and tablet markets, wide bandwidth voice and data communication have become ubiquitous.

We first focus on measuring the delay performance of a very popular cloud storage service Amazon S3. We establish that there is significant randomness in service times for reading and writing small and medium size objects when assigned distinct keys. We further demonstrate that using erasure coding, parallel connections to storage cloud and limited chunking (i.e., dividing the object into a few smaller objects) together pushes the envelope on service time distributions significantly (e.g., 76%, 80%, and 85% reductions in mean, 90th, and 99th percentiles for 2-MB files) at the expense of additional storage (e.g., 1.75\n<formula formulatype=\"inline\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\times$</tex></formula>\n). However, chunking and erasure coding increase the load and hence the queuing delays while reducing the supportable rate region in number of requests per second per node. Thus, in the second part of our paper, we focus on analyzing the delay performance when chunking, forward error correction (FEC), and parallel connections are used together. Based on this analysis, we develop load-adaptive algorithms that can pick the best code rate on a per-request basis by using offline computed queue backlog thresholds. The solutions work with homogeneous services with fixed object sizes, chunk sizes, operation type (e.g., read or write) as well as heterogeneous services with mixture of object sizes, chunk sizes, and operation types. We also present a simple greedy solution that opportunistically uses idle connections and picks the erasure coding rate accordingly on the fly. Both backlog-based and greedy solutions support the full rate region and provide best mean delay performance when compared to the best fixed coding rate policy. Our evaluations show that backlog-based solutions achieve better delay performance at higher percentile values than the greedy solution.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/6985690/06668987.pdf","startPage":"2012","endPage":"2025","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2013.2289382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2013.2289382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985690","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6668987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FAST CLOUD: Pushing the Envelope on Delay Performance of Cloud Storage With Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Cloud computing","Servers","Encoding","Forward error correction","Approximation methods","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud storage","delay","forward error correction (FEC)","queueing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"FAST CLOUD: Pushing the Envelope on Delay Performance of Cloud Storage With Coding","volume":"22","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6668987/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FAST CLOUD: Pushing the Envelope on Delay Performance of Cloud Storage With Coding","sourcePdf":"tnet-liang-2289382-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080997S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6985690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6985690","articleId":"6668987","onlineDate":"18 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6668988,"authors":[{"name":"Shlomo Greenberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6777988/6668988/6668988-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shlomo Greenberg received the B.Sc., M.Sc.

A selective SRPG approach mitigates the area and power overhead of the conventional SRPG technique. However, only very few papers suggesting a selective SPRG approach were published. The proposed SSRPG technique employs a formal analysis and, therefore, does not require exhaustive simulations. To implement the new approach, an automatic algorithm, which is performed on a gate-level netlist, has been developed. This algorithm enables the extraction of a subset of flip-flops that is sufficient for a proper state retention power gating. Unique selective SRPG criteria have been defined to support the proposed algorithm. These criteria are used to reduce the total amount of the required retention cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first robust SSRPG approach using gate-level analysis for selecting a reduced sub set of FFs that require retention. The proposed approach has been applied to a practical design with about 3300 FFs. The experimental results show 78% reduction of the retention SPRG cell area overhead, compared to the common SRPG approach.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2286029","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6777988/06668988.pdf","startPage":"1095","endPage":"1104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2286029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective State Retention Power Gating Based on Gate-Level Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 December 2013","displayDocTitle":"Selective State Retention Power Gating Based on Gate-Level Analysis","volume":"61","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14196510","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6668988/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668988/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective State Retention Power Gating Based on Gate-Level Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcsi-greenberg-2286029-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056013S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6777988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6777988","articleId":"6668988","onlineDate":"03 December 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6668989,"authors":[{"name":"Amirhossein Alimohammad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6777988/6668989/6668989-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amirhossein Alimohammad is an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the San Diego State University.

In addition to the well-known independent and identically distributed channel model, the simulator supports three spatio-temporally correlated fading channel models which are commonly used for performance analysis.

As figure of merit, we consider the achievable information rate of the entire system and with functional analysis, we establish a general form of the optimal transmit filter, which can then be optimized by standard numerical methods. As a corollary to our main result, we obtain some insight of the behavior of the standard waterfilling algorithm for intersymbol interference channels. With only some minor changes, the general form we derive can be applied to multiple-input multiple-output channels with intersymbol interference. To illuminate the practical use of our results, we provide applications of our theoretical results by deriving the optimal shaping pulse of a linear modulation transmitted over a bandlimited additive white Gaussian noise channel which has possible applications in the faster-than-Nyquist/time packing technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6689285/06668994.pdf","startPage":"4997","endPage":"5005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2013.110813.130385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2013.110813.130385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6668994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Transmit Filters for ISI Channels under Channel Shortening Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Detectors","Complexity theory","Optimization","Information rates","Vectors","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","filtering theory","functional analysis","intersymbol interference","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal transmit filters","ISI channels","channel shortening detection","intersymbol interference channels","reduced receiver complexity constraint","functional analysis","standard numerical methods","standard waterfilling algorithm","general form","multiple-input multiple-output channels","optimal shaping pulse","linear modulation","bandlimited additive white Gaussian noise channel","faster-than-Nyquist-time packing technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ISI channels","channel shortening","waterfilling algorithms","reduced complexity detection","mismatched receivers","MIMO-ISI","faster-than-Nyquist","time packing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6668994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Transmit Filters for ISI Channels under Channel Shortening Detection","volume":"61","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6668994/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13990130","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Transmit Filters for ISI Channels under Channel Shortening Detection","sourcePdf":"4997-tc1312-andrea.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094609S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6689285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6689285","articleId":"6668994","onlineDate":"18 November 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6669038,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control is a structured controller introducing a SPR (strict positive real) element instead of I element for PID control. The purpose is to design a P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D controller for aysmptotical stabilization and to adjust P, SPR, D gain matrices for the improvement of control performances. We make stability analysis of the P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control via LMI, based on Lyapunov's direct method. We extend the P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control to adaptive P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control in the case where plant parameters change. Namely, we make an effort to stabilize the closed-loop system and to improve convergence speed to the desired equilibrium by adding an adaptive control mode with a time-varying gain matrix to the usual P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D controller. Consequently the closed-loop system keeps asymptotical stability against unknown plant-parameter changes. For the adaptive P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control we propose, it is not necessary to assume the minimum phase property of the plant. The P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control can be modified to P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D+I control for improving the steady state performance (an off-set).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control design via LMI for linear MIMO systems and its extension to adaptive control","publicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2013.6669161","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6657188/6669080/06669161.pdf","startPage":"839","endPage":"845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2013.6669161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6669080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6669161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6669161/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control design via LMI for linear MIMO systems and its extension to adaptive control","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6669161/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13936209","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control design via LMI for linear MIMO systems and its extension to adaptive control","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081907S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6657188","isNumber":"6669080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6657188","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6669080","articleId":"6669161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6669196,"authors":[{"name":"Edward N.

This paper presents a data-driven prognostic method based on the utilization of signal processing techniques and regression models. The method is applied on accelerated degradations of bearings performed under the experimental platform called PRONOSTIA. The purpose of the proposed method is to generate a health indicator, which will be used to calculate the RUL. Two acceleration sensors are used on PRONOSTIA platform to monitor the degradation evolution of the tested bearings. The vibration signals related to the degraded bearings are then compared to a nominal vibration signal of a non-degraded bearing (nominal bearing). The comparison between the signals is done by calculating a correlation coefficient (which is considered as the health indicator). The values of the calculated correlation coefficient are then fitted to a regression model which is used to estimate the RUL.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6669223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6669223/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13936221","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven prognostics based on health indicator construction: Application to PRONOSTIA's data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven prognostics based on health indicator construction: Application to PRONOSTIA's data","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066902S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6657188","isNumber":"6669080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6657188","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6669080","articleId":"6669223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6669232,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Diversi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Diversi","id":"37324661300"},{"name":"Umberto Soverini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Umberto","lastName":"Soverini","id":"37324663800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-033-03962-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6669232","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Mathematical model","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Noise","Monte Carlo methods","Instruments","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","least squares approximations","Monte Carlo methods","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["errors-in-variables model","EIV model identification","quadratic eigenvalue problem","additive white noise","nonlinear system","normal equations","high order Yule-Walker equations","linear generalized eigenvalue problem","parameter estimation","Monte Carlo simulations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6669232","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2013.6669232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2013.6669232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6669080","publicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6657188/6669080/06669232.pdf","startPage":"1896","endPage":"1901","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of errors-in-variables models as a quadratic eigenvalue problem","abstract":"The paper proposes a new approach for identifying linear dynamic errors-in-variables (EIV) models, whose input and output are affected by additive white noise.

The neural network parameters are adjusted in real-time using the Unscented Kalman filter algorithm and no pre-operational training phase is required. Dual adaptive control aims to strike a compromise between the two control characteristics of caution and probing, leading to an improved overall performance. The system is evaluated through numerical simulations and Monte Carlo analysis. The resulting performance of the dual adaptive controller is not only consistently superior to non-dual adaptive control schemes, but also surpasses the performance of similar controllers that are based on Extended Kalman filter estimators. This reflects the enhanced accuracy of the Unscented Kalman filter estimator, despite being a local estimation method. In addition, unlike use of other estimators, the proposed approach neither requires the computation of complex Jacobian matrices as part of the design, nor the evaluation of such matrices in real-time. This renders the proposed controller inherently amenable and practical for real-time implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6669237/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13950908","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6669237/","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2013","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unscented transform-based dual adaptive control of nonlinear MIMO systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unscented transform-based dual adaptive control of nonlinear MIMO systems","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.185536S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6657188","isNumber":"6669080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6657188","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6669080","articleId":"6669237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6669319,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In order to reduce the chattering phenomenon without deteriorating the tracking performance, the discontinuous term in the classical sliding mode technique is replaced by an adaptive Proportional Derivative (PD) term. The effect of the approximation error which arises from the PD term is reduced by adding a robust term in the proposed control law. All parameter, adaptive laws and the robust control term, are derived based on the Lyapunov stability analysis. The overall adaptive sliding mode scheme guarantees the asymptotic convergence to zero of tracking errors and the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system.

As a result, the algorithm is suitable for implementation on autonomous hardware with low computational power. In the case of a strongly convex objective function, we prove that the algorithm has linear rate of convergence. An MPC scheme based on this algorithm is derived, such that the computations of feasible and stabilizing inputs are distributed and cheap, and can be done by each subsystem in part. Some implementation issues of the new algorithm for MPC problems are discussed, as well as it being tested on a 4 tank laboratory setup.","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2013.6669390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2013.6669390","startPage":"3596","endPage":"3601","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6657188/6669080/06669390.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6669080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computationally efficient parallel coordinate descent algorithm for MPC: Implementation on a PLC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"A computationally efficient parallel coordinate descent algorithm for MPC: Implementation on a PLC","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6669390/","accessionNumber":"13950913","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6669390/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computationally efficient parallel coordinate descent algorithm for MPC: Implementation on a PLC","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070062S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6657188","isNumber":"6669080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6657188","xplore-issue":"6669080","articleId":"6669390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6669400,"authors":[{"name":"Diego Romeres","affiliation":["Center for Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation, University of California, Santa Barbara"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Romeres","id":"37086098761"},{"name":"Florian D\u00f6rfler","affiliation":["Center for Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation, University of California, Santa Barbara"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"D\u00f6rfler","id":"37545454200"},{"name":"Francesco Bullo","affiliation":["Center for Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation, University of California, Santa Barbara"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Bullo","id":"37282169800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-033-03962-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6669400","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":526},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aggregates","Laplace equations","Power system dynamics","Symmetric matrices","Damping","Vectors","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","perturbation techniques","power system control","reduced order systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slow coherency approach","power networks","area aggregation","model reduction","time-scale separation","singular perturbation analysis","first-order consensus systems","second-order power system swing dynamics","system damping","Laplacian flows","aggregate damping","inertia matrices"]}],"abstract":"We revisit the classic slow coherency and area aggregation approach to model reduction in power networks. The slow coherency approach is based on identifying sparsely and densely connected areas of a network, within which all generators swing coherently. A time-scale separation and singular perturbation analysis then results in a reduced low-order system, where coherent areas are collapsed into aggregate variables. Here, we study the application of slow coherency and area aggregation to first-order consensus systems and second-order power system swing dynamics. We unify different theoretic approaches and ideas found throughout the literature, we relax some technical assumptions, and we extend existing results. In particular, we provide a complete analysis of the second-order swing dynamics - without restrictive assumptions on the system damping. Moreover, we identify the reduced aggregate models as generalized first or second-order Laplacian flows with multiple time constants, aggregate damping and inertia matrices, and possibly adverse interactions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel results on slow coherency in consensus and power networks","publicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2013.6669400","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6657188/6669080/06669400.pdf","startPage":"742","endPage":"747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2013.6669400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6669080","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6669400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6669400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Novel results on slow coherency in consensus and power networks","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6669400/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13950849","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel results on slow coherency in consensus and power networks","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059669S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6657188","isNumber":"6669080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6657188","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6669080","articleId":"6669400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6669412,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Patrinos","affiliation":["IMT - Institute for Advanced Studies, Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Patrinos","id":"38233038100"},{"name":"Alberto Guiggiani","affiliation":["IMT - Institute for Advanced Studies, Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Guiggiani","id":"37085554145"},{"name":"Alberto Bemporad","affiliation":["IMT - Institute for Advanced Studies, Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Bemporad","id":"37300848100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-033-03962-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6669412","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Hardware","Vectors","Optimization","Computer architecture","Approximation methods","Predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","cost reduction","embedded systems","fixed point arithmetic","gradient methods","power aware computing","predictive control","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixed-point dual gradient projection algorithm","embedded model predictive control","dynamical system control","quadratic program","embedded applications","QP","DGP","fixed-point hardware","convergence rate analysis","fixed-point arithmetic","integer bits","fractional bits","suboptimal solution","cost reduction","power consumption reduction","hardware device"]}],"abstract":"Although linear Model Predictive Control has gained increasing popularity for controlling dynamical systems subject to constraints, the main barrier that prevents its widespread use in embedded applications is the need to solve a Quadratic Program (QP) in real-time.

The main interior-point algorithm is a standard primal-dual Mehrotra predictor-corrector method with Nesterov-Todd scaling and self-dual embedding, with search directions found via a symmetric indefinite KKT system, chosen to allow stable factorization with a fixed pivoting order. The indefinite system is solved using Davis' SparseLDL package, which we modify by adding dynamic regularization and iterative refinement for stability and reliability, as is done in the CVXGEN code generation system, allowing us to avoid all numerical pivoting; the elimination ordering is found entirely symbolically.

The method is based on the principles of stochastic anomaly detection and relies on measured data for probability distribution estimation and evaluation. For visual stimuli that excite the essential nonlinear dynamics of the human oculomotor system, mean gaze trajectories and characterizations of their uncertainty are approximated per individual using eye-tracking data. With this information, eye-tracking profiles are established, against which independently acquired data sets are statistically tested to evaluate the probability that they belong to said profiles. Both Gaussian function fitting and kernel density estimation (KDE) techniques are used for distribution estimation and novel means for testing observations against general distributions are suggested. It is shown that the presented method yields promising results in terms of individual classification based on eye movements.

In embedded applications, it is critical to be able to verify code correctness, but it is also desirable to be able to rapidly prototype and deploy high-performance solvers for different problems. To balance these two requirements, we propose a code generation system that takes high-level descriptions of convex optimization problems and generates code that maps the parameters in the original problem to data in an equivalent second-order cone program, which is then solved by a single, external solver that can be verified once and for all. A novel aspect is that we restrict the parameters in the original problem to only appear in affine functions, which lets us map the parameters to problem data without performing any floating point operations. As a result, the generated code is lightweight, fast, and trivial to verify. The approach thus marries the benefits of high-level parser/solvers with custom, high-performance, high-reliability solvers for embedded applications.","doi":"10.23919/ECC.2013.6669712","publicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Control Conference (ECC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6657188/6669080/06669712.pdf","startPage":"1547","endPage":"1552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/ECC.2013.6669712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6669080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code generation for embedded second-order cone programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6669712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6669712/","displayDocTitle":"Code generation for embedded second-order cone programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13936316","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6669712/","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code generation for embedded second-order cone programming","confLoc":"Zurich, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"1087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086378S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6657188","isNumber":"6669080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6657188","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6669080","articleId":"6669712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUCA","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6669751,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The only requirement on the set of reference inputs is having continuous bounded derivatives, up to second order for FOI-DC and up to third order for SOI-DC. The correctness analysis of the algorithms relies on singular perturbation theory for non-autonomous dynamical systems.

To meet the real-time requirements, an efficient algorithm based on the Real Time Iteration (RTI) scheme for the Direct Multiple Shooting method is exported through automatic C code generation. The exported plain C-code is tailored to the model dynamics, resulting in computation times in the range of a few milliseconds. In addition to state estimates, MHE provides friction coefficient estimates, allowing the controller to adapt to varying road conditions.

The static feedforward neural network model was identified using Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation method in order to map nonlinear relations between system variables limitations and control gains.
