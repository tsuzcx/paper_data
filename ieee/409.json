The limited availability of parking results in traffic congestion, air pollution as well as driver frustration. The price for parking expansion is usually prohibitive or extremely high. Recently researchers turned to applying technologies for efficient parking management. In our previous work, we have developed an optical wireless sensor network (WSN) for traffic monitoring. We have demonstrated our system to the public in several exhibitions. It is realized that this simple invention could be applied to monitor vehicles in a parking garage. The system can then inform drivers of the number of available parking spaces and in which area should they be directed to. This kind of system should avoid driver's frustration in trying endlessly to find a parking space in a crowded parking garage. This paper describes our work to modify our original WSN and applies it to parking garages. Problems associated to applying our original WSN to parking garage are explained, and solutions are proposed","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4090056/4090057/04090136.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops","doi":"10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4090136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Parking: An Application of Optical Wireless Sensor Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Optical sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Telecommunication traffic","Monitoring","Cities and towns","Air pollution","Ultraviolet sources","Technology management","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","traffic engineering computing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart parking","optical wireless sensor network","traffic congestion","air pollution","driver frustration","parking management","traffic monitoring","vehicle monitoring","crowded parking garage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Smart Parking","Traffic Monitoring","WSN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Smart Parking: An Application of Optical Wireless Sensor Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4090136/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9342914","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"15-19 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Parking: An Application of Optical Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"27570066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036508S","chronDate":"15-19 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4090056","isNumber":"4090057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4090056","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4090057","articleId":"4090136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4090152,"authors":[{"name":"Ryoichi Kawahara","affiliation":["NTT Service Integration Laboratorie, NTT Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoichi","lastName":"Kawahara","id":"38126171900"},{"name":"Tatsuya Mori","affiliation":["NTT Service Integration Laboratorie, NTT Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Mori","id":"37278022000"},{"name":"Noriaki Kamiyama","affiliation":["NTT Service Integration Laboratorie, NTT Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriaki","lastName":"Kamiyama","id":"37283026600"},{"name":"Shigeaki Harada","affiliation":["NTT Service Integration Laboratorie, NTT Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeaki","lastName":"Harada","id":"37306784800"},{"name":"Shoichiro Asano","affiliation":["NTT Service Integration Laboratorie, NTT Corporation, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoichiro","lastName":"Asano","id":"37281867000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2757-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4090152","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Telecommunication traffic","Sampling methods","Statistical analysis","Monitoring","IP networks","Fluid flow measurement","Power measurement","Velocity measurement","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","sampling methods","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection","flow statistics","packet sampling","network scan","SYN flooding"]}],"abstract":"We investigate how to detect network anomalies using flow statistics obtained through packet sampling.

Recent studies have demonstrated that analyzing traffic patterns is crucial in detecting network anomalies. We may not be able to infer the original traffic patterns correctly from the sampled flow statistics because sampling process wipes out a lot of information about small flows, which play a vital role in determining the characteristics of traffic patterns. In this paper, we first show an example of how the sampling process wipes out the original statistics using measured data. Then, we show empirical examples indicating that the original traffic pattern cannot be inferred correctly even if we use a statistical inference method for incomplete data, i.e., the EM algorithm, for sampled flow statistics. Finally, we show that additional information about the original flow statistics, the number of unsampled flows, is helpful in tracking the change in original traffic patterns using sampled flow statistics.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.51","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on Applications and the Internet Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4090056/4090057/04090156.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"85","doi":"10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inferring Original Traffic Pattern from Sampled Flow Statistics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Inferring Original Traffic Pattern from Sampled Flow Statistics","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4090156/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9353006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090156/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inferring Original Traffic Pattern from Sampled Flow Statistics","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"27570085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038944S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4090056","isNumber":"4090057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4090056","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4090057","articleId":"4090156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4090175,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Lemuet","affiliation":["Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, California, USA","PRiSM, Versailles, Quadrics Ltd."],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Lemuet","id":"37281893900"},{"name":"Jack Sampson","affiliation":["CSE Dept, UCSD, USA","HP Labs"],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Sampson","id":"37420427300"},{"name":"Jean Francois Collard","affiliation":["HewlettPackardLaboratories1501 Page Mill RoadPalo Alto, California"],"firstName":"Jean Francois","lastName":"Collard","id":"37371600200"},{"name":"Norm Jouppi","affiliation":["Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, California, USA"],"firstName":"Norm","lastName":"Jouppi","id":"37273884000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2700-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4090175","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":89},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Potential Energy Efficiency of Vector Acceleration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Potential energy","Acceleration","Laboratories","Milling machines","Energy efficiency","Computer architecture","Graphics","High performance computing","Microprocessors","Permission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","microprocessor chips","parallel architectures","system-on-chip","vector processor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["potential energy efficiency","vector accelerator architecture","high-bandwidth on-chip cache system","run-ahead lane"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4090175","abstract":"Energy efficiency of computation is quickly becoming a key problem from the chip through the data center.

The similarity between sequences enables biologists to detect evolutionary relationships and infer biological properties of the unknown sequence. mpiBLAST, our parallel BLAST, decreases the search time of a 300 KB query on the current NT database from over two full days to under 10 minutes on a 128-processor cluster and allows larger query files to be compared. Consequently, we propose to compare the largest query available, the entire NT database, against the largest database available, the entire NT database. The result of this comparison can provide critical information to the biology community, including insightful evolutionary, structural, and functional relationships between every sequence and family in the NT database. Preliminary projections indicated that to complete the task in a reasonable length of time required more processors than were available to us at a single site. Hence, we assembled GreenGene, an ad-hoc grid that was constructed \"on the fly\" from donated computational, network, and storage resources during last year's SC|05. GreenGene consisted of 3048 processors from machines that were distributed across the United States. This paper presents a case study of mpiBLAST on GreenGene - specifically, a pre-run characterization of the computation, the hardware and software architectural design, experimental results, and future directions","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4090162/4090163/04090196.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SC.2006.46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2006.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090163","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4090196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Genomic Sequence-Searching on an Ad-Hoc Grid: Experiences, Lessons Learned, and Implications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genomics","Bioinformatics","Databases","Sequences","Evolution (biology)","Assembly","Computer networks","Grid computing","Hardware","Software design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","genetics","grid computing","medical information systems","message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel genomic sequence","ad-hoc grid","basic local alignment search tool","biological property","NT database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bioinformatics","BLAST","sequence search","grid computing","cluster computing","optical networking","scheduling","fault tolerance","scalability","agile development","scripting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Genomic Sequence-Searching on an Ad-Hoc Grid: Experiences, Lessons Learned, and Implications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4090196/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9451991","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Genomic Sequence-Searching on an Ad-Hoc Grid: Experiences, Lessons Learned, and Implications","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27000022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088645S","chronDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4090162","isNumber":"4090163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4090162","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4090163","articleId":"4090196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4090205,"authors":[{"name":"Sage A.

We present several new algorithms and implementation techniques that significantly accelerate parallel MD simulations compared with current state-of-the-art codes. These include a novel parallel decomposition method and message-passing techniques that reduce communication requirements, as well as novel communication primitives that further reduce communication time. We have also developed numerical techniques that maintain high accuracy while using single precision computation in order to exploit processor-level vector instructions. These methods are embodied in a newly developed MD code called Desmond that achieves unprecedented simulation throughput and parallel scalability on commodity clusters. Our results suggest that Desmond's parallel performance substantially surpasses that of any previously described code. For example, on a standard benchmark, Desmond's performance on a conventional Opteron cluster with 2K processors slightly exceeded the reported performance of IBM's Blue Gene/L machine with 32K processors running its Blue Matter MD code","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4090162/4090163/04090217.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"43","publicationTitle":"SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SC.2006.54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2006.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090163","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4090217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Algorithms for Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Commodity Clusters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Computational modeling","Discrete event simulation","Pharmaceuticals","Acceleration","Computer aided instruction","Throughput","Scalability","Code standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","distributed memory systems","message passing","molecular biophysics","molecular dynamics method","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molecular dynamics simulation","biomolecular system","parallel decomposition method","message-passing technique","numerical technique","processor-level vector instruction","parallel scalability","commodity cluster"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Algorithms for Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Commodity Clusters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4090217/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9451996","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Algorithms for Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Commodity Clusters","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27000043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114093S","chronDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4090162","isNumber":"4090163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4090162","citationCount":"427","xplore-issue":"4090163","articleId":"4090217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4090218,"authors":[{"name":"Blake G.

Like most accelerators, FPGAs are very efficient at both dense matrix multiplication and FFT computations, but two important aspects of how to deliver that performance to applications have received too little attention. First, the standard API for important compute kernels hides parallelism from the system. Second, the issue of system architecture is virtually never addressed. This paper explores both issues and their implications for applications. We find that high bandwidth, low latency connectivity can be important, but the right API can be even more important","doi":"10.1109/SC.2006.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2006.13","publicationTitle":"SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4090162/4090163/04090223.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Architectures and APIs: Assessing Requirements for Delivering FPGA Performance to Applications","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9343096","htmlLink":"/document/4090223/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectures and APIs: Assessing Requirements for Delivering FPGA Performance to Applications","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27000049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078651S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4090162","isNumber":"4090163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4090162","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4090163","articleId":"4090223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-08"},{"_id":4090224,"authors":[{"name":"Julie Langou","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Langou","id":"37086746068"},{"name":"Julien Langou","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Langou","id":"37392794200"},{"name":"Piotr Luszczek","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Luszczek","id":"37892026800"},{"name":"Jakub Kurzak","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Kurzak","id":"37646491900"},{"name":"Alfredo Buttari","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Buttari","id":"37828772300"},{"name":"Jack Dongarra","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Dongarra","id":"37270009400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2700-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4090224","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":478},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Floating-point arithmetic","Linear systems","Permission","Lifting equipment","Microprocessors","Engines","Linear algebra","Iterative methods","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","iterative methods","linear algebra","mathematics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["32 bit floating point arithmetic","iterative refinement","linear systems","linear algebra","large sparse systems","eigenvalue problems","single precision computations","double precision algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Recent versions of microprocessors exhibit performance characteristics for 32 bit floating point arithmetic (single precision) that is substantially higher than 64 bit floating point arithmetic (double precision). Examples include the Intel's Pentium IV and M processors, AMD's Opteron architectures and the IBM's Cell Broad Engine processor. When working in single precision, floating point operations can be performed up to two times faster on the Pentium and up to ten times faster on the Cell over double precision. The performance enhancements in these architectures are derived by accessing extensions to the basic architecture, such as SSE2 in the case of the Pentium and the vector functions on the IBM Cell. The motivation for this paper is to exploit single precision operations whenever possible and resort to double precision at critical stages while attempting to provide the full double precision results. The results described here are fairly general and can be applied to various problems in linear algebra such as solving large sparse systems, using direct or iterative methods and some eigenvalue problems. There are limitations to the success of this process, such as when the conditioning of the problem exceeds the reciprocal of the accuracy of the single precision computations. In that case the double precision algorithm should be used","doi":"10.1109/SC.2006.30","publicationTitle":"SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '06: Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4090162/4090163/04090224.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2006.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting the Performance of 32 bit Floating Point Arithmetic in Obtaining 64 bit Accuracy (Revisiting Iterative Refinement for Linear Systems)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4090224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090224/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting the Performance of 32 bit Floating Point Arithmetic in Obtaining 64 bit Accuracy (Revisiting Iterative Refinement for Linear Systems)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9343097","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4090224/","conferenceDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting the Performance of 32 bit Floating Point Arithmetic in Obtaining 64 bit Accuracy (Revisiting Iterative Refinement for Linear Systems)","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"27000050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076556S","chronDate":"11-17 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4090162","isNumber":"4090163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4090162","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4090163","articleId":"4090224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4090225,"authors":[{"name":"Franz Franchetti","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Franchetti","id":"37330879000"},{"name":"Yevgen Voronenko","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Yevgen","lastName":"Voronenko","id":"37282014100"},{"name":"Markus Puschel","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Puschel","id":"37284075500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7695-2700-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4090225","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Discrete Fourier transforms","Spirals","Libraries","Frequency","Tuning","Automatic programming","Fourier transforms","Discrete transforms","Load management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic programming","discrete Fourier transforms","mathematics computing","microprocessor chips","parallelising compilers","resource allocation","rewriting systems","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FFT program generation","shared memory system","SMP","multicore systems","automatic performance tuning frameworks","Spiral program generator","linear transforms","discrete Fourier transform","rewriting system","load balancing","multithreaded code generation","DFT","chip multiprocessor"]}],"abstract":"The chip maker's response to the approaching end of CPU frequency scaling are multicore systems, which offer the same programming paradigm as traditional shared memory platforms but have different performance characteristics.

We present a shared memory extension of Spiral. The extension within Spiral consists of a rewriting system that manipulates the structure of transform algorithms to achieve load balancing and avoids false sharing, and of a backend to generate multithreaded code.

By using competitive learning, Kohonen's self-organizing maps (KSOM) can generate mappings from high-dimensional signal spaces to lower dimensional topological structures. The main features of KSOM are formation of topology preserving feature maps and approximation of input probability distribution. However, KSOM have some shortages, e.g., a fixed number of neural units and a fixed topology dimensionality which can result in problems if this dimensionality does not match the dimensionality of the feature manifold. Compared to KSOM, growing self-organizing neural networks (GSONN) can change their topological structures during learning. The topology formation of both GSONN and KSOM is driven by soft competitive learning. This paper first gives an introduction to KSOM and neural gas network. Then, we discuss some GSONN without fixed dimensionality such as growing neural gas and the author's model: twin growing neural gas and it's application for pattern classification.

Not only does this technique include the effects of the properties of the shield material, but it also includes the details of the geometry of the enclosure. Furthermore, this approach allows a nonempirical consideration of mesh enclosures and the effects of resistive seams in enclosure walls. By working with the circuit analogue, penetration by transient fields can also be computed. Essentially the enclosure is viewed as an antenna. In the case of magnetic shielding effectiveness, the enclosure is viewed as a short circuited loop antenna. In the case of electric field penetration, the enclosure is viewed as a fat electric dipole. Using this characterization and exact solutions where available, the current distribution on the outside of the enclosure is first determined. Then, based on the current distribution, the penetrating fields are computed. The equations are developed in such a way as to preserve a lumped circuit analogue for the low-frequency region. The basic circuit equations for magnetic field penetration are rederived from a rigorous solution. Rules to estimate the rise-time, fall-time, and peak magnitudes of transient penetrating fields are developed. The electric shielding effectiveness is developed in a similar manner. In both cases the results of the circuit approach agree well with those based on rigorous solutions of the electromagnetic boundary conditions.

Attention is particularly focused on matched filters which exhibit a large time-bandwidth product (i.e., spread spectrum systems). For these cases, the output signal-to-interference power ratio is determined for any type of interfering signal. The central limit theorem also allows the determination of error probabilities for these cases. In the determination of error probabilities, two receiver configurations have been employed, one a completely linear receiver employing a simple threshold and the other a receiver which uses an envelope detector followed by a threshold decision mechanism. The results of a preliminary investigation of the low-time band-width case have also been discussed and show that smaller amounts of processing gain can also be obtained for this case. A tabulated summary of the gains available for 81 signal and interference cases has been given.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1968.302965","startPage":"285","endPage":"292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4090389/04090415.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1968.302965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utilization of Matched Filters in Cochannel Interference Suppression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1968","displayDocTitle":"Utilization of Matched Filters in Cochannel Interference Suppression","publicationDate":"June 1968","volume":"EMC-10","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1968","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilization of Matched Filters in Cochannel Interference Suppression","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-10-n2-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053886S","chronDate":"June  1968","isNumber":"4090389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4090415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4090490,"authors":[{"name":"Luis L.

Assuming that the signal is amplitude-bounded, bounds on the WFT domain sample amplitudes are obtained. From an appropriately chosen group of sample amplitudes in the WET domain, corresponding set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsums in the signal damain can be obtained. From the knowledge of these subsums, amplitude bounds on the remaining WET domain samples can be obtained. The group of sample amplitudes in the WFT domain may be recursively chosen. This results into the partitioning of WET domain in various sets such that all the samples of a particular set have the same amplitude bounds. Two such recursive procedures are worked out. Set-dependent quantization transfer characteristics, restricteci within the dynamic amplitude range appropriate to individual sets, are proposed. Effect of both the set-dependent WFT damain quantization schemes on the reconstructed signal is analyzed. Efficient computational algorithms are developed. Appropriate signal characteristics for both the schemes are pointed out.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1971","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 1971","volume":"EMC-13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude Bounds and Quantization Schemes in Walsh-Fourier Domain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude Bounds and Quantization Schemes in Walsh-Fourier Domain","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-13-n3-38.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038684S","chronDate":"Aug.  1971","isNumber":"4090591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","articleId":"4090629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4090638,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The central roles of geometry, directionality (beam patterns), waveforms (from the interfering sources), motion (Doppler), source density and distribution, and secular variations of source parameters, as well as the radiation mechanism, are specifically developed. The basic statistical model (BSM) involves independent sources, in space (and in time), leading to Poisson radiation fields and a Poisson process X(t) in a typical receiver. This received process X(t) can be considered the sum of a Gauss process (by the central limit theorem) representing the cumulative effects of a large number of sources, none of which is very large vis-\u00e0-vis the rest, and a Poisson process produced by those few strong transients which when present dominate the background. The process X(t) is essentially stationary for periods comparable to the secular period of changes in traffic intensity and flow, which permits the construction of usefully large experimental ensembles from which to estimate the process statistics. A semiempirical, but more analytically tractable model similar to that introduced by Hall [6] for impulsive atmospheric noise but used here for independent sources is also constructed. This model is represented by X(t) = a(t) Z(t), where a,Z are independent processes, both zero mean, and Z is regarded as Gaussian.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical-Physical Models of Urban Radio-Noise Environments - Part I: Foundations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1972.303188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4090673/04090677.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"56 -","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1972.303188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4090677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1972","displayDocTitle":"Statistical-Physical Models of Urban Radio-Noise Environments - Part I: Foundations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"EMC-14","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"May 1972","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical-Physical Models of Urban Radio-Noise Environments - Part I: Foundations","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-14-n2-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041758S","chronDate":"May  1972","isNumber":"4090673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"99","articleId":"4090677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4090702,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This type of noise causes errors in digital systems. Since it is impossible to define a general model for impulsive noise, one must measure the necessary statistical paramaters to be used for calculating its effect on a communication link. Although these parameters vary for different types of links, peak amplitude distribution, time distribution, and duration of impulses at various amplitude levels should be known. In this paper noise amplitude distribution (NAD) measurements carried out on the VHF/UHF bands for ignition noise are explained.

The coupling through the rhombic-shaped holes in the braid is approximated by using the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of elliptical holes of the same width and length as the rhombus. The analysis develops the transfer impedance and the mutual capacitance of the shield. The transfer impedance is calculated and plotted for shields of different optical coverages. The variation of mutual capacitance and mutual inductance with the weave angle of the braid are examined.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1975.303389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4090870/04090877.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1975.303389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shielding Effectiveness of Braided-Wire Shields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4090877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4090877/","displayDocTitle":"Shielding Effectiveness of Braided-Wire Shields","volume":"EMC-17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1975","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shielding Effectiveness of Braided-Wire Shields","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-17-n2-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020566S","chronDate":"May  1975","isNumber":"4090870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"95","articleId":"4090877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4090892,"authors":[{"name":"Motohisa Kanda","affiliation":["Noise and Interference Section, Electronaneticsx Division, Institute for Basic Standards, National Bureau of Standards, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Motohisa","lastName":"Kanda","id":"37341325700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"4090892","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4090892","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1975.303397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1975.303397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4090888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4090888/04090892.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time and Amplitude Statistics for Electromagnetic Noise in Mines","abstract":"The time and amplitude statistics illustrated are important and useful in describing the time-dependent, measured electromagnetic (EM) noise in mines.

This is in agreement with previous results obtained by Soviet investigators who utilize averaged boundary conditions for analyzing such bonded wire meshes.

In addition, the nature, origins, measurement, and prediction of the general EM interference environment are a major concern of any adequate spectral management program. Accordingly, this study is devoted to the development of analytically tractable, experimentally verifiable, statistical-physical models of such electromagnetic interference. Here, classification into three major types of noise is made: Class A (narrow band vis-\u00e1-vis the receiver), Class B (broad band vis-\u00e1-vis the receiver), and Class C (= Class A + Class B). First-order statistical models are constructed for the Class A and Class B cases. In particular, the APD (a posteriori probability distribution) or exceedance probability, PD, vis;P1 (\u03f5 > \u03f5o)A,B, (and the associated probability densities, pdf's w1(\u03f5)A,B,[1]) of the envelope are obtained; (the phase is shown to be uniformly distributed in (0, 2\u03c0). These results are canonical, i.e., their analytic forms are invariant of the particular noise source and its quantifying parameter values, levels, etc. Class A interference is described by a 3-parameter model, Class B noise by a 6-parameter model.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1977.303527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1977.303527","startPage":"106","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091038/04091042.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical-Physical Models of Electromagnetic Interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1977","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1977","displayDocTitle":"Statistical-Physical Models of Electromagnetic Interference","volume":"EMC-19","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 1977","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical-Physical Models of Electromagnetic Interference","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-19-n3-Part-I-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073434S","chronDate":"Aug.  1977","isNumber":"4091038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"654","articleId":"4091042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4091068,"authors":[{"name":"George H.

The discussion is illustrated by a concise review of model statistics, methods of estimating the model parameters, including the effects on accuracy of finite data samples. A variety of signal detection problems are similarly used to illustrate the very large potential improvement possible when optimum algorithms are employed, vis-a-vis most of the currently used systems, which are conventionally optimized for Gaussian interference. Conditions for realizing such gains are also given, and the principal key properties of these new, general models are discussed.

RFI susceptibility predictions for RF incident upon the op-amp input terminals are made using a complete model, a macromodel, and a voltage-offset model. Both the batch-mode computer program SPICE 2 and the commercial interactive computer program ISPICE are used. The three sets of calculated results are essentially identical and agree within 4 dB with experimental results measured at 220 MHz. A threshold cannot be given for the RF power level at which a 741 op amp is susceptible to RFI. The level depends upon the op-amp circuit application. For op-amp circuits designed to amplify input signals in the 0.1-to 1.0-V range, RF power levels as large as -15 to + 5 dBm may be required to cause RHI susceptibility problems. For op-amp circuits designed to amplify input signals in the 1-to 10-mV range, RF power levels as low as -55 to -35 dBm may cause RHI susceptibility problems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1979.303770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091297/04091303.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"306","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1979.303770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-Aided Analysis of RFI Effects in Operational Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Computer-Aided Analysis of RFI Effects in Operational Amplifiers","volume":"EMC-21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1979","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-Aided Analysis of RFI Effects in Operational Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-21-n4-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031418S","chronDate":"Nov.  1979","isNumber":"4091297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"33","articleId":"4091303","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4091323,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Corona","affiliation":["Onde Eletromagnetiche, Istituto Universitario Navale, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Corona","id":"37274947800"},{"name":"Gaetano Latmiral","affiliation":["Onde Eletromagnetiche, Istituto Universitario Navale, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Gaetano","lastName":"Latmiral","id":"37992532300"},{"name":"Enrico Paolini","affiliation":["Onde Eletromagnetiche, Istituto Universitario Navale, Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Paolini","id":"37705938300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"4091323","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":372},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4091323","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shielded enclosure","reverberating","variable geometry","performance","analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1980.303814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091319/04091323.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1980.303814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and Analysis of a Reverberating Enclosure with Variable Geometry","abstract":"Mode stirred chambers are discussed.

The keystone of this technique is the so-called in-cell inductance-the inductance per unit length a thin wire would have with respect to an enclosing conductor half a cell removed. THREDE results using this formalism are compared with analytic EMP solutions for a linear dipole antenna and a loop antenna. Errors are around 10 percent for the loop and 7 percent for the dipole. The 10-percent loop error could probably be improved; the 7-percent dipole error seems to be fundamental to the basic THREDE approximations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Difference Analysis of EMP Coupling to Thin Struts and Wires","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1981.303899","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091419/04091427.pdf","startPage":"88","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1981.303899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4091427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091427/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1981","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Difference Analysis of EMP Coupling to Thin Struts and Wires","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"EMC-23","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"May 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Difference Analysis of EMP Coupling to Thin Struts and Wires","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-23-n2-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02322S","chronDate":"May  1981","isNumber":"4091419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"197","articleId":"4091427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4091490,"authors":[{"name":"Leslie A.

The canonical Class A formula predicts that the interdecile range of non- Gaussian noise (structured interference) is less than about 30 dB. A simple scenario that produces canonical Class A interference is described. The limited interdecile range of the interference forces the interfering sources in the simple scenario to be located within a limited range of distances.

The utility of this technique is demonstrated by predicting the responses arising from the coupling of an incident exterior field across an aperture in a hollow cylinder to an interior wire. Expansions on the order of fourfold or more are possible. The cost of such increased resolution is a second computer run, doubling the cost as opposed to a cost increase of a factor of 64 if the resolution equivalent to a fourfold expansion were sought from a single run. Possible applications extend to many diverse areas, but most importantly, interior coupling problems may be treated using this technique. For example, this technique may provide a useful method for estimating the responses of cables interior to an aircraft.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091487/04091501.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1981.303984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1981.303984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091487","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4091501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Technique for Increasing the Resolution of Finite-Difference Solutions of the Maxwell Equation","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maxwell equation","finite-difference solution","enhanced resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1981","displayDocTitle":"A Technique for Increasing the Resolution of Finite-Difference Solutions of the Maxwell Equation","volume":"EMC-23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Technique for Increasing the Resolution of Finite-Difference Solutions of the Maxwell Equation","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-23-n4-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034969S","chronDate":"Nov.  1981","isNumber":"4091487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"55","articleId":"4091501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4091518,"authors":[{"name":"Luigi Moreno","affiliation":["Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecommunicazioni S. p.

These data support a l/f2 to 11f3 slope for sferics at frequencies above the HF range.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1982.304069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091559/04091574.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"369","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1982.304069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measured Spectral Amplitude of Lightning Sferics in the HF, VHF, and UHF Bands","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Measured Spectral Amplitude of Lightning Sferics in the HF, VHF, and UHF Bands","volume":"EMC-24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measured Spectral Amplitude of Lightning Sferics in the HF, VHF, and UHF Bands","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-24-n3-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033437S","chronDate":"Aug.  1982","isNumber":"4091559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"10","articleId":"4091574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4091589,"authors":[{"name":"Korada Umashankar","affiliation":["IIT Research Institute, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Korada","lastName":"Umashankar","id":"38132581800"},{"name":"Allen Taflove","affiliation":["IIT Research Institute, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Allen","lastName":"Taflove","id":"37280689500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9375"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-187X"}],"articleNumber":"4091589","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":357,"citationCountPatent":16,"totalDownloads":2152},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/emcs/"}],"abstract":"The finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method is proposed as a means of accurately computing electromagnetic scattering by arbitrary-shaped extremely complex metal or dielectric objects excited by an external plane wave.

Then, an electromagnetic-field equivalence principle is invoked at a virtual surface of this rectangular volume to transform the tangential near scattered fields to the far field. To verify the feasibility of this method, the surface currents, near scattered fields, far scattered fields, and radar cross section of two canonical two-dimensional objects are presented. For these cases, it is shown that the FD-TD method provides magnitude of current and field predictions which are within \u00b1 2.5 percent and further phase values within \u00b1 30 of values predicted by the method of moments ( MOM) at virtually every point including in shadow regions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091584/04091589.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1982.304054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1982.304054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4091589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method to Analyze Electromagnetic Scattering of Complex Objects","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic scattering","complex objects","finite-difference time-domain method","equivalence principle","surface current","near scattered fields","far fields","radar cross section"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1982","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method to Analyze Electromagnetic Scattering of Complex Objects","volume":"EMC-24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method to Analyze Electromagnetic Scattering of Complex Objects","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-24-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044886S","chronDate":"Nov.  1982","isNumber":"4091584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"357","articleId":"4091589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4091620,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald J.

This paper includes a summary of new results for both canonical and specific types of desired signals and electromagnetic interference (EMI) environments. A suitable bias term, missing in most earlier analyses, is essential to preserve the asymptotically optimum (AO) character of these algorithms, as sample size (or observation period ~n) necessarily becomes large, to enable the detection of weak signals with acceptably small probabilities of error. Canonical optimum threshold algorithms are obtained for three principal modes of detection: 1) coherent, 2) incoherent, and 3) composite. The latter 3) is AO, when it consists of the sum of (optimum) algorithms for 1) and 2); it can give noticeable improvement over either 1) or 2) alone. Various (usually) suboptimum algorithms, e.g., simple correlators and clipper correlators, are also considered. Performance measures (n > > 1), e.g., error probabilities, etc., and asymptotic relative efficiencies (ARE's), are noted, along with the useful concepts of processing gain and minimum detectable signal. Interpretations of the algorithmic structure and the implications of these results, generally, for EMC, are concisely discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091695/04091701.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1984.304173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1984.304173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4091701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Threshold Detection in Non-Gaussian Interference Environments: Exposition and Interpretation of New Results for EMC Applications","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Threshold detection","non-Gaussian interference","EMC applications","canonical algorithms","optimum and suboptimum detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Threshold Detection in Non-Gaussian Interference Environments: Exposition and Interpretation of New Results for EMC Applications","volume":"EMC-26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Threshold Detection in Non-Gaussian Interference Environments: Exposition and Interpretation of New Results for EMC Applications","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-26-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021579S","chronDate":"Feb.  1984","isNumber":"4091695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"39","articleId":"4091701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4091719,"authors":[{"name":"Robert G.

Since this noise is due primarily to appliances such as universal motors, light dimmers, television receivers, and certain switching power supplies located on the secondary side of the distribution transformer, the noise varies dramatically with time as these appliances are turned on and off. Measurements of the noise inserted into the distribution circuit by several representative appliances are presented. The noise measurement technique itself, as well as the resulting measurements, are described. Background noise which is present in the absence of such appliances was also measured. These noise measurements are important for the design of communications systems, such as distribution-line carrier, which operate in the 5-20 kHz region and use the distribution line as a communications medium.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1984.304217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091743","startPage":"161","endPage":"168","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091743/04091748.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise on Residential Power Distribution Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1984","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Noise on Residential Power Distribution Circuits","publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"EMC-26","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise on Residential Power Distribution Circuits","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-26-n4-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027332S","chronDate":"Nov.  1984","isNumber":"4091743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"98","articleId":"4091748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4091774,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen A.

These antenna patterns, such as peakamplitude, peak-power, energy, and slope patterns, have been derived for various array lengths under a noiseless assumption. The slope patterns are the most attractive for angular resolution. In this paper, line-array beamforming techniques are developed to provide slope patterns for nonsinusoidal signals. The techniques employ sliding correlators (SC's) for suppressing the additive Gaussian noise present with the received signal, and pulse-shaping processors for determining the slope pattern. Computer simulation is done for deriving peak-amplitude and slope patterns for various array lengths. Also, a method for obtaining monopulse peakamplitude and slope patterns is presented.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1985.304278","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091801/04091812.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1985.304278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","startPage":"143","endPage":"151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Line-Array Beam-Forming And Monopulse Techniques Based on Slope Patterns of Nonsinusoidal Waveforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4091812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Line-Array Beam-Forming And Monopulse Techniques Based on Slope Patterns of Nonsinusoidal Waveforms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091812/","volume":"EMC-27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Line-Array Beam-Forming And Monopulse Techniques Based on Slope Patterns of Nonsinusoidal Waveforms","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-27-n3-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04427S","chronDate":"Aug.  1985","isNumber":"4091801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"9","articleId":"4091812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4091846,"authors":[{"name":"Malek G.

This permits an analysis based on a transmissionline characterization. However, when the wavelength is large compared to the dimensions of the enclosure, other analytical approaches provide better results. It has been shown that the current distribution on a box-like object scattering in the Rayleigh region tends to concentrate at the edges and corners of the box. This leads to concentrations of the magnetic field in the vicinity of edges and corners both inside and outside the enclosure. Since the effects of the current concentrations are localized, the magnetic shielding problem can be simplified by assuming a uniform current distribution on the exterior of the enclosure. Under this assumption the socalled \"circuit approach\" can be applied. The box-like enclosure is characterized as a series of shorted turns which shield a sensor within the enclosure. Based on the geometry, the mutual and leakage impedances between the source and sensor are used to compute the magnetic shielding effectiveness. This approach yields valid results for shields constructed of either wire mesh or sheet metal. It can also be extended to account for degradation due to bad bonds. A comparison of results, both transient and steady state, of the circuit approach and scattering theory show close agreement for spherical enclosures.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.1966.304426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4091965/04091969.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.1966.304426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometrical Effects on Shielding Effectiveness at Low Frequencies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4091969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4091969/","displayDocTitle":"Geometrical Effects on Shielding Effectiveness at Low Frequencies","volume":"EMC-8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometrical Effects on Shielding Effectiveness at Low Frequencies","sourcePdf":"TEMC-vEMC-8-n4-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078826S","chronDate":"Dec.  1966","isNumber":"4091965","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4091969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4092025,"authors":[{"name":"Gorschwin Fey","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gorschwin","lastName":"Fey","id":"37265818100"},{"name":"Tim Warode","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Warode","id":"38124925900"},{"name":"Rolf Drechsler","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Drechsler","id":"37276502700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2762-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-9667"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-6923"}],"articleNumber":"4092025","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic test pattern generation","Circuit faults","Engines","Robustness","Circuit testing","Computer science","Benchmark testing","Redundancy","Databases","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test pattern generation","computability","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAT-based ATPG","learning techniques","circuit-based learning","computability","automatic test pattern generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4092025","abstract":"The robustness of engines for ATPG has to be improved to cope with the growing size of circuits.

The emergence of three-dimensional (3D) chip architectures, with its intrinsic capability to reduce the wire length, is one of the promising solutions to mitigate the interconnect related issues. In this paper we implement a few components of a microprocessor using custom design to show the potential performance and power benefits achievable through 3D integration under thermal constraints. We also introduce a standard cell based 3D design flow which leverages the commercial 2D design tools. Using this design flow we provide performance results of wide range of arithmetic units in 3D, thus introducing a fast method to analyze the performance benefits of 3D designs. In contrast to prior work, which mostly investigates single components of a processor, our work takes multiple components into consideration and the experimental results are promising in terms of delay and power reductions. Complex designs in 3D that have equivalent performance compared to a simple 2D designs is taken for IPC improvement analysis.

The power consumption, delay and area of these new compressor architectures are compared with existing and recently proposed compressor architectures and are shown to perform better. The proposed architecture lays emphasis on the use of multiplexers in arithmetic circuits that result in high speed and efficient design. Also in all existing implementations of XOR gate and multiplexers, both output and its complement are available but current designs of compressors do not use these outputs efficiently. In the proposed architecture these outputs are efficiently utilized to improve the performance of compressors.

Few applications running on FPGAs consumed excessive power. Today, the temperature of FPGAs are a major concern due to increased logic density and speed. Large applications with highly pipelined datapaths can ultimately generate more heat than the package can dissipate. For FPGAs that operate in controlled environments, heat sinks and fans can be used to effectively dissipate heat from the device. However, FPGA devices operating under harsher thermal conditions in outdoor environments, or in systems with malfunctioning cooling systems need a thermal management control system. To address this issue, we had previously devised a reconfigurable temperature monitoring system that gives feedback to the FPGA circuit using the measured junction temperature of the device. Using this feedback, we designed a novel dual frequency switching system that allows the FPGA circuits to maintain the highest level of throughput performance for a given maximum junction temperature. This paper extends the previous work by additionally making this adaptive frequency mechanism workload aware and evaluating power and latency performance under bursty workload conditions. Our working system has been implemented on the field programmable port extender (FPX) platform developed at Washington University in St. Louis. Experimental results with a scalable image correlation circuit show up to a 30% saving in power for bursty workloads and up to a 2x factor improvement in latency performance as compared to a system without thermal or workload feedback. Our circuit provides power efficient high performance processing of bursty workloads, while ensuring the device always operates within a safe temperature range","doi":"10.1109/VLSID.2007.68","publicationTitle":"20th International Conference on VLSI Design held jointly with 6th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"20th International Conference on VLSI Design held jointly with 6th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4091978/4091979/04092076.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSID.2007.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically Optimizing FPGA Applications by Monitoring Temperature and Workloads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4092076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4092076/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically Optimizing FPGA Applications by Monitoring Temperature and Workloads","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9343107","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4092076/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically Optimizing FPGA Applications by Monitoring Temperature and Workloads","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"27620391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066744S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4091978","isNumber":"4091979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4091978","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4091979","articleId":"4092076","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4092101,"authors":[{"name":"Aseem Gupta","affiliation":["Center for Embedded Computer Systems University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aseem","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37277924000"},{"name":"Nikil D.

In deep sub-micron technologies, the interconnect cross-section areas of metal at various points in a layer are no longer the same -the metal can be etched differently with varying width and spacings and/or the top-surface of the interconnect layer may be non-planar due to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Moreover, the cross-sections are also becoming increasingly trapezoidal in nature. In such a scenario, computing resistances using counting squares technique and other two-dimensional methods may no longer be accurate. At the same time, using highly accurate techniques such as a fine-grained finite element method (FEM) may not be feasible due to the large computation time. In this work, a three-dimensional FEM based resistance extractor that is fast and accurate has been implemented and compared with two other extractors, a counting squares based extractor and a meshing based extractor.

With a wide range of design parameter change, less than 8% of estimation error is achieved by the proposed SNM model.

A promising category of microfluidic biochips relies on the principle of electrowetting-on-dielectric, whereby discrete droplets ofnanoliter volumes can be manipulated using an array of electrodes. As chemists adapt more bioassays for concurrent execution on such \"digital\" droplet-based microfluidic platforms, system integration, design complexity, and the need for defect tolerance are expected to increase rapidly. Automated design tools for defect-tolerant and multifunctional biochips are important for the emerging marketplace, especially for low-cost, portable, and disposable devices for clinical diagnostics. We propose a unified synthesis method that combines defect-tolerant architectural synthesis with defect-aware physical design. The proposed approach allows architectural-level design choices and defect- tolerant physical design decisions to be made simultaneously. We use a large-scale protein assay and the polymerase chain reaction procedure as case studies to evaluate the proposed synthesis method. We also carry out simulations based on defect injection to evaluate the robustness of the synthesized biochip design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defect-Aware Synthesis of Droplet-Based Microfluidic Biochips","publicationTitle":"20th International Conference on VLSI Design held jointly with 6th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID'07)","doi":"10.1109/VLSID.2007.60","displayPublicationTitle":"20th International Conference on VLSI Design held jointly with 6th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4091978/4091979/04092115.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSID.2007.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4091979","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4092115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4092115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Jan. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Defect-Aware Synthesis of Droplet-Based Microfluidic Biochips","conferenceDate":"6-10 Jan. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4092115/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"10251837","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defect-Aware Synthesis of Droplet-Based Microfluidic Biochips","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"27620647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057285S","chronDate":"6-10 Jan. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4091978","isNumber":"4091979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4091978","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4091979","articleId":"4092115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4092118,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv V.

One such growing issue of concern is the degradation of PMOS devices due to negative bias temperature instability (NBTI). NBTI has detrimental effects on the threshold voltage of the PMOS transistor thereby leading to lower performance and noise degradation over time in digital systems. The degradation is measured as reduction in static noise margin (SNM) of SRAM cells in memories and as timing impact in digital circuits. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of NBTI on different components for current and future generation FPGAs was provided. Solutions based on the reversible nature of this phenomenon and the static probabilities at the gate of the PMOS devices in any system were also provided.

It demonstrates that the methods used in the existing studies lead to unduly pessimistic results and therefore they must be modified. The paper also compares the effectiveness of some of the known solutions that address NBTI degradation.

Currently proposed countermeasures (Pramstaller, 2005)-(Tin and Verbauwhede, 2004) to prevent DPA imposes significant area, power and performance overheads. In addition they either require special standard cell library and design flows or algorithmic modifications. Recently, random dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (RDVFS) has been proposed (Yang et al., 2005) as a DPA countermeasure, which has less area, power and performance overheads and it does not require special cell library nor design flows nor algorithmic modifications. However, in a synchronous digital circuit, the operating frequency can be detected by monitoring glitches on the power line. In this paper, the authors show that using this information, it is possible to mount a DPA attack on circuits employing RDVFS countermeasure. The authors propose an alternative technique which only varies the supply voltage randomly.

Genetic algorithms are known for their capability to solve a wide range of optimization problems and one of the most relevant features of GAs is their structural parallelism that fits well the intrinsically distributed grid architecture. The proposed architecture is based on different specialized autonomous entities able to interact in order to carry out a global optimization task. The interaction is based on exchange of knowledge on the problem and solutions. In this way the main problem can be solved by using many cooperative small entities that can be classified into different specialized families that cover only one aspect of the global problem. The topology is based on archipelagos of islands that interact by chromosomes migrating with a user-definable strategy. Grid has been mainly used in the high performance computing area. The properties of the proposed GAs architecture and its related computing properties have great potential in solving big instances of optimization problems. Furthermore this implementation (distributed genetic algorithms with grid computing) is suitable to solve time consuming problems reducing by executing different instances on many virtual organizations (VOs) according to the grid philosophy. The proposed parallel algorithm has been tested on denoising problems applied to image processing which are known to be time consuming.

It is difficult to diagnose a multilevel-inverter drive (MLID) system using a mathematical model because MLID systems consist of many switching devices and their system complexity has a nonlinear factor. Therefore, a neural network (NN) classification is applied to the fault diagnosis of a MLID system. Multilayer perceptron networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring faults. The principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized in the feature extraction process to reduce the NN input size. A lower dimensional input space will also usually reduce the time necessary to train a NN, and the reduced noise may improve the mapping performance. The output phase voltage of a MLID can be used to diagnose the faults and their locations. The reconfiguration technique is also proposed. The effects of using the proposed reconfiguration technique at high modulation index are addressed. The proposed system is validated with experimental results. The experimental results show that the proposed system performs satisfactorily to detect the fault type, fault location, and reconfiguration","doi":"10.1109/COMPEL.2006.305633","startPage":"317","endPage":"323","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshops on Computers in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4097436/4097437/04097445.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE Workshops on Computers in Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEL.2006.305633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfiguration Technique for Multilevel Inverters Incorporating Diagnostic System Based on Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Neural networks","Fault diagnosis","Principal component analysis","Mathematical model","Multilayer perceptrons","Feature extraction","Noise reduction","Voltage","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","feature extraction","invertors","multilayer perceptrons","power engineering computing","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfiguration technique","fault diagnostic system","neural network","MLID system","multilevel-inverter drive","multilayer perceptron network","fault location","principal component analysis","PCA","feature extraction","NN training","modulation index"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4097445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfiguration Technique for Multilevel Inverters Incorporating Diagnostic System Based on Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4097445/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2007","conferenceDate":"16-19 July 2006","accessionNumber":"9452943","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfiguration Technique for Multilevel Inverters Incorporating Diagnostic System Based on Neural Network","confLoc":"Troy, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"10-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105082S","chronDate":"16-19 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4097436","isNumber":"4097437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4097436","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4097437","articleId":"4097445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4097478,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Yousefzadeh","affiliation":["Colorado Power Electronics Center, ECE Department University of Colorado at Boulder, USA"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Yousefzadeh","id":"37301191300"},{"name":"Toru Takayama","affiliation":["Colorado Power Electronics Center, ECE Department University of Colorado at Boulder, USA"],"firstName":"Toru","lastName":"Takayama","id":"38231955300"},{"name":"Dragan Maksimovi","affiliation":["Colorado Power Electronics Center, ECE Department University of Colorado at Boulder, USA"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Maksimovi","id":"37426274700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9725-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9724-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-5142"}],"articleNumber":"4097478","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1567},"abstract":"This paper introduces a fully synthesizable hybrid digital pulse width modulator (DPWM).

demonstrated the feasibility of charge trap-based devices with ultra-thin tunnel oxide for high density DRAM application. Experimental results using direct tunneling scheme show good memory characteristics such as long retention time (>1000sec), large memory window (>1V), non-destructive read, high endurance, and acceptable programming speed (~100ns). Further improvement for low operation voltage and sub-6F2 cell size can be achieved by adopting a novel hot electron injection method. This novel operation scheme is helpful for efficient programming and minimizing disturbance.

First, it is explained that in such cases there can be many functions implemented by neural networks that will accurately approximate training patterns. Then it is pointed out that many of these functions do not allow for proper estimation of the inputs importance using the sensitivity analysis method for neural networks. These two facts are demonstrated to be the reason why one can not completely rely upon the results of this method, when evaluating a real importance of inputs. Examples with graphs visualizing the discussed phenomena are presented. Finally, general conclusions about overall usefulness of the method are introduced.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCYB.2006.305714","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Computational Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/4097647/4097648/04097675.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Computational Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCYB.2006.305714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations of sensitivity analysis for neural networks in cases with dependent inputs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensitivity analysis","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Input variables","Photonics","Visualization","US Department of Transportation","Transfer functions","Neurons","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","feedforward neural nets","graph theory","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensitivity analysis","dependent inputs","feedforward neural networks","approximate training patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4097675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Limitations of sensitivity analysis for neural networks in cases with dependent inputs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4097675/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"10251789","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations of sensitivity analysis for neural networks in cases with dependent inputs","confLoc":"Talinn, Estonia","sourcePdf":"ICCCYB-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045108S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4097647","isNumber":"4097648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4097647","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4097648","articleId":"4097675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4097713,"authors":[{"name":"Liancheng Su","affiliation":["Optical-Electronic Information Laboratory Shenyang Institute ofAutomation (SIA), Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Liancheng","lastName":"Su","id":"37848614800"},{"name":"Chuanjiang Luo","affiliation":["Optical-Electronic Information Laboratory, Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), CAS, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110016, China; Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China, lcj0603@sia.cn"],"firstName":"Chuanjiang","lastName":"Luo","id":"37834875200"},{"name":"Feng Zhu","affiliation":["Optical-Electronic Information Laboratory Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279447300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0528-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0529-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4097713","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stereo vision","Cameras","Mobile robots","Navigation","Mirrors","Optical sensors","Content addressable storage","Machine vision","Sensor systems","Robot vision systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","edge detection","image matching","image sensors","mobile robots","navigation","robot vision","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["omnidirectional stereo vision system","mobile robot navigation","hyperbolic mirror","catadioptic sensor","panoramic image","vertical epipolar line","stereo edge matching method","Canny edge detection","obstacle detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Omnidirectional stereo vision","catadioptric sensor","depth recovery"]}],"abstract":"This study describes a method to obtain obstacle information omnidirectionally by a novel omnidirectional stereo vision system. Such information is important for mobile robots navigation. The omnidirectional stereo vision system is based on a common perspective camera coupled with two hyperbolic mirrors. Given two images of a space point acquired by this vision system, the 3D coordinates of the point can be calculated by means of triangulation. Then the study presents a full model of calibrating this vision system, which can be easily generalized to all kinds of catadioptic sensors. The images captured by the stereo vision system are unwrapped into panoramic images, which are then examined for stereo matching along vertical epipolar lines. An algorithm of the quick stereo edge matching method based on Canny edge detection is proposed. In the end we show the result of obstacle detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICIA.2006.305769","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4097704/4097705/04097713.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIA.2006.305769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obtaining Obstacle Information by an Omnidirectional Stereo Vision System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4097713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4097713/","displayDocTitle":"Obtaining Obstacle Information by an Omnidirectional Stereo Vision System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"10215914","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4097713/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obtaining Obstacle Information by an Omnidirectional Stereo Vision System","confLoc":"Veihai, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA-00-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109675S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4097704","isNumber":"4097705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4097704","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4097705","articleId":"4097713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4097718,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Fan","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China","School of Computer Science, Shannxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Fan","id":"38005880700"},{"name":"Qingfeng Meng","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Qingfeng","lastName":"Meng","id":"38001822800"},{"name":"Youyun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38129195500"},{"name":"Wuwei Feng","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Wuwei","lastName":"Feng","id":"38008337000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0528-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0529-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4097718","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Filter bank","Signal processing","Signal detection","Additive noise","Fourier transforms","Colored noise","Gaussian processes","Gaussian noise","Adaptive signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","estimation theory","Gaussian noise","signal denoising","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher order cumulants","Gaussian noise","symmetric noise","signal feature detection","additive noise","narrow frequency band","bandpass filter banks","short-time estimation","third-order cumulant","colored noise suppression"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Detection Based on Filter Banks and Higher Order Cumulants","doi":"10.1109/ICIA.2006.305774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097705","endPage":"566","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4097704/4097705/04097718.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIA.2006.305774","startPage":"562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4097718","abstract":"Based on that higher-order cumulants is insensitive to add-Gaussian noise and symmetric noise, a method for detecting feature of signal embedded in additive noise is presented, which combines a filter banks and higher-order cumulants, neither the supposition of the observed signal is Gaussian or stationary, nor a prior information about the waveform and arrive time of the observed signal is necessary.

As a result in the course of evolution of the host populations virus populations evolve themselves by importing the excellent patterns from their host populations and in turn accelerate evolution of host populations. Furthermore the niche technology is adopted to avoid premature convergence, enrich the variety of the population, and enhance capacity of global search.

It needs to solve a mapping relationship between the sensing space and the action space. The relationship can be achieved through different ways. But it is difficult to be expressed by an accurate equation. This paper uses multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) to construct a path-planning controller by its powerful nonlinear functional approximation. Then the path planning task is simplified to a classified problem which are five state-action mapping relationship. One reinforcement learning method, Q-learning, is used to collect training samples for the ANN controller. At last the trained controller runs in the simulation environment and retrains itself furthermore combining the reinforcement signal during the interaction with the environment. Strategy based on the Combination of ANN and Q-learning is better than using only one of the two methods. The simulation result also shows that the strategy can find the optimal path than using Q-learning only.","doi":"10.1109/ICIA.2006.305870","pdfPath":"/iel5/4097704/4097705/04097803.pdf","startPage":"978","endPage":"982","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIA.2006.305870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Network Based on Q-learning for Mobile Robot Path Planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4097803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Network Based on Q-learning for Mobile Robot Path Planning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"10216009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4097803/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Artificial Neural Network Based on Q-learning for Mobile Robot Path Planning","confLoc":"Veihai, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA-00-98.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048654S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4097704","isNumber":"4097705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4097704","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4097705","articleId":"4097803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4097815,"authors":[{"name":"Geng Yanfeng","affiliation":["Department of Automation, China University of Petroleum, Dongying, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Geng","lastName":"Yanfeng","id":"38132877000"},{"name":"Zheng Jinwu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, China University of Petroleum, Dongying, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Jinwu","id":"38127727700"},{"name":"Shi Gang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, China University of Petroleum, Dongying, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Gang","id":"38134141300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0528-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0529-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4097815","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fluid flow measurement","Orifices","Neural networks","Phase measurement","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Fluid flow","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Velocity measurement","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow measurement","flow sensors","flowmeters","mass transfer","neural nets","two-phase flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-phase flow rate measurement","slotted orifice couple","flow sensor","flow coefficient","gas-liquid two phase flow","mass flow rate","back propagation neural network","two-phase flow meter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["slotted orifice","neural network ensemble","two-phase flow meter","feature extraction","principal component analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4097815","abstract":"Slotted orifice is a new type of flow sensor, and its flow coefficient is insensitive to the upstream velocity profile of single phase flow.

One way is using the corresponding velocity as a probability measure by the transfer function and THSDPSO with this way is called BTHSDPSO. Another is directly using the hard limit function and THSDPSO with this way is called HTHSDPSO.

Further, this GKFD also performs well for linearly nonseparable pattern classification problems for it possesses a nonlinear transformation capability.

It has been shown that, in the presence of synchronization error between different relaying nodes of even a fractional symbol, coded cooperation using space-time block codes may experience severe inter- symbol interference (ISI) and, subsequently, significant performance degradation. It becomes even more challenging when Doppler effect exists as the result of moving transmit and/or receive nodes. In this paper, we propose the use of BLAST-type of data transmission combined with effective channel coding. The relative independence between the information transmitted from different nodes allows individualized compensation of the time delay and Doppler shift, whereas the channel coding of the information across different transmit nodes assures high spatial diversity. As the result, the proposed scheme is capable in maintaining a high data rate in a dynamical channel environment. It provides robust and reliable communication quality by taking advantages of spatial information multiplexing and spatial diversity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIA.2006.305957","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4097704/4097705/04097890.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"138","doi":"10.1109/ICIA.2006.305957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Network Communications in Dynamic Channel Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Network Communications in Dynamic Channel Environments","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4097890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"10215924","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4097890/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Network Communications in Dynamic Channel Environments","confLoc":"Veihai, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA-00-185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055835S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4097704","isNumber":"4097705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4097704","xplore-issue":"4097705","articleId":"4097890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4097894,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Guo","affiliation":["Departmentof information Scienceand Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Guo","id":"37287186000"},{"name":"Ji-lin Liu","affiliation":["Departmentof information Scienceand Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Ji-lin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086912125"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0528-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0529-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4097894","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image communication","Image segmentation","Parity check codes","Error correction codes","Pixel","Robustness","Channel coding","Linear matrix inequalities","PSNR","Maintenance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","image coding","image segmentation","multimedia communication","parity check codes","visual communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image communication","adaptive image segmentation","WIPC-LDPC coding","wireless channel","error resilient ability","image transmission","joint source channel coding scheme","low-density parity check","weight-increasing parity-check","visual quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["JSCC","LDPC","WIPC","UEP"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve error resilient ability and transmission efficiency for image transmission over wireless channels, a joint source channel coding (JSCC) scheme was proposed in this paper, in which adaptive image segmentation and irregular low-density parity check (LDPC) was fitted together.

According to the characteristic of these medical images, this paper proposes a glomerulus extraction method based on wavelet transformation and watershed algorithm. First, a LOG filter is applied to the low-resolution image, which corresponds to low frequency sub band after wavelet transformation, so that rough edge information can be obtained. After labeling to remove the noises and thinning, a genetic algorithm is applied to search the best fitting curve, which determines the barycenter position of glomerulus and sets this barycenter as seed. Secondly, the image which contains complete object boundary can be obtained through watershed transform, after region growing operation, glomerulus region can be extracted. With abundant samples, experimental result indicates our method can extract the glomerulus from kidney-tissue image both accurately and availably.","doi":"10.1109/ICIA.2006.305781","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition","pdfPath":"/iel5/4097704/4097705/04097985.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIA.2006.305781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical Image Segmentation Based on Wavelet Transformation and Watershed Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4097985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4097985/","displayDocTitle":"Medical Image Segmentation Based on Wavelet Transformation and Watershed Algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"10215952","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4097985/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical Image Segmentation Based on Wavelet Transformation and Watershed Algorithm","confLoc":"Veihai, China","sourcePdf":"ICIA-00-280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052002S","chronDate":"20-23 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4097704","isNumber":"4097705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4097704","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4097705","articleId":"4097985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4098005,"authors":[{"name":"Tze-chiang Chen","affiliation":["VP of Science and Technology, IBM Thomas J.

The continuous and systematic increase in transistor density and performance, guided by CMOS scaling theory (Dennard et al., 1974) and described in \"Moore's Law\" (Moore, 1975), has been a highly successful process for the development of silicon technology for the past 40 years. As the silicon industry moves into the 45 nm node and beyond, significant technology challenges are imposed by silicon CMOS device scaling. Two of the most important challenges are the growing standby power dissipation and the increasing variability in device characteristics. These complaints are the embodiments of CMOS approaching atomistic and quantum-mechanical physics boundaries. They are frequently cited as the reason Moore's Law is \"broken\", or why CMOS scaling is coming to an end. Industry directions for addressing these challenges are developing along three primary extending silicon scaling through innovations in materials and device structure; expanding the level of integration through three-dimensional structures comprised of silicon through-via holes and chip stacking in order to enhance functionality and parallelism; and exploring post-silicon CMOS innovation with new nano-devices based on distinctly different principles of physics, new materials, and new processes, such as spintronics, carbon nanotubes, nanowires, or molecular systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overcoming research challenges for CMOS scaling: industry directions","publicationTitle":"2006 8th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2006.306040","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 8th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/4097995/4097996/04098005.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2006.306040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4098005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4098005/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Overcoming research challenges for CMOS scaling: industry directions","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4098005/","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9408818","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overcoming research challenges for CMOS scaling: industry directions","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"P0004-0007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046062S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4097995","isNumber":"4097996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4097995","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4097996","articleId":"4098005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4098009,"authors":[{"name":"Peter M.

Functional CMOS devices in the range of 5 nm channel length have been demonstrated. Multigate architectures allow to increase devices drivability, reduce power, new memory devices opportunities and will be necessary to develop future applications.

The equivalent electrical circuit can be used to simulate the transient response and frequency-shifting characteristic of the beam under electrostatic loads.

Furthermore, the trap generation models in endurance and interface trap recovery model in HTS are proposed. Endurance characteristics show that the interface trap and bulk trap generation have a power-dependence on program/erase cycle count (DeltaN\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">it</sub>\n, DeltaN\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ot</sub>\n infin cycleuarrm). The exponent of interface trap generation both program and erase are 0.62; while in bulk trap generation, the exponent for the cycle count is 0.30, which is extracted only from the erased cells due to varying stored charges of programmed cells during tunnel oxide degradation. The HTS characteristics show that the interface trap recovery and electron-detrapping are the major mechanisms for sub-90nm NAND flash memory, while stress induced leakage current (SILC) is almost negligible.

This spin-RAM based FPGA circuit could process securely the information in low power dissipation and high speed; meanwhile all the data processed are stored permanently in the distributed spin-RAM memory. In this non-volatile FPGA design, MTJs (magnetic tunnel junction) are used as storage elements. Contrary to conventional MRAM circuits we don't use a complex sense amplifier, but a simple SRAM based sense amplifier couples two MTJs per bit. The non-volatility of spin-RAM allows the dynamical configuration of FPGA circuits and the start-up time of circuit can be decreased up to some hundred pico seconds. As conventional MRAM, the MTJs of spin-RAM will be on the semiconductor surface; therefore the circuit die area will not be enlarged comparing with the conventional FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2006.306511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2006.306511","publicationTitle":"2006 8th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 8th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated Circuit Technology Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/4097995/4097996/04098238.pdf","startPage":"799","endPage":"802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4097996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of Spin-RAM technology in FPGA circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4098238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integration of Spin-RAM technology in FPGA circuits","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 April 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9408510","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4098238/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of Spin-RAM technology in FPGA circuits","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"P0799-0802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059842S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4097995","isNumber":"4097996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4097995","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4097996","articleId":"4098238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4098240,"authors":[{"name":"Deyuan Xiao","affiliation":["Special Flash Division, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Deyuan","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38118184600"},{"name":"Jongwoo Kim","affiliation":["Special Flash Division, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jongwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37087172187"},{"name":"T.

Load-pull measurement data on IBM 7HP SiGe power devices have been made at 900MHz and 2.4GHz and monolithic class E PAs have been designed using these devices to achieve highest power-added-efficiency (PAE) at these frequencies. It is found that high PAE can be achieved for monolithic single-stage Class E PAs designed using high-breakdown SiGe transistors at ~65% (900MHz) and ~40% (2.4GHz), respectively, which are roughly ~10% lower than the device's maximum PAE values obtained by load-pull tests under optimal off-chip matching conditions. We have also demonstrated that monolithic SiGe class E PAs can be successfully linearized using an open-loop envelope tracking (ET) technique as their output spectra pass the stringent EDGE transmit mask with margins, achieving overall PAE of 44.4% for the linearized PA system that surpasses the < 30% PAE with commercially available GaAs Class AB PAs for EDGE applications.

This paper used neural network to perform VLSI power estimation. Experiments were made on ISCAS89 benchmark.

Different net structure, training plans and vector organizations were applied. For limited number of test vector (number of benchmark circuits), limited experimental results showed the neural network based power estimation method could give acceptable results with specific net structure. Power estimation runs faster. Linear regression is used to evaluate neural net. Probabilistic results of regression R-value are observed. Analysis shows that unfolded regression R-value sample fit normal distribution.

In this paper, on-chip femto-ampere current monitoring methodologies based on improved sawtooth oscillator whose average leakage is as small as 3.844fA (at the room temperature of 27deg C) have been proposed and verified using SMIC models of 0.18mum CMOS process.

The MBARI Mapping AUV is a 21\" diameter, Dorado class autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a 200 kHz multibeam sonar, 110 kHz and 410 kHz sidescan sonars, and a 2-16 kHz subbottom profiler. All components of the vehicle are rated to 6000 m depth. Using precise navigation and attitude data from an laser-ring-gyro-based inertial navigation system (INS) integrated with a Doppler velocity log sonar (DVL), the Mapping AUV can image the deep-ocean seafloor and shallow subsurface structure with much greater resolution than is possible with hull-mounted sonars. The system can also be operated in an ROV-mounted configuration, allowing near-bottom surveys in very restricted terrain. The Mapping AUV has conducted several autonomous surveys of Monterey Canyon and Smooth Ridge in Monterey Bay, and ROV-mounted surveys of five sites along the Monterey Canyon axis during 2005 and 2006. During June 2006, the Mapping AUV surveyed mounds and channel deposits in the Santa Monica Basin.

The purpose is to separate waves by exploiting the diversity of the polarization state and propagation velocity between wavefields. In this paper, we propose a method based on the shift-invariance properties of multiple wavefields impinging on a uniform linear array of sensors to separate different waves by jointly estimating the velocity and polarization parameters. The surface waves are removed using a spatial filter specifically designed to exploit velocity and polarization of different waves. We introduce a model for wideband polarized signals received by an array of three-component vector-sensors and use it as a framework for implementing the proposed algorithms.

The results deriving from the data fusion compose the position vector of the vehicle, with respect to the center of the tracked object. This position vector can be used for a closed loop steering control of the vehicle. The integration of the system was proved successful through the experimental procedure.

The ideal platform for exploring these sites in response to episodic events is a remotely-piloted, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that is capable of sending back high-quality video or other high-rate sensor data. The combined requirement of remote command/control and high data rates argues for a bi-directional optical communications link capable of streaming data at 1-10 Mbit per second rates. In this paper, we present a preliminary design for an optical modem system based on an omnidirectional source and receiver. The functional requirements and system constraints driven by use case scenarios are first reviewed. This is followed by a discussion of the optical transmission properties of seawater and the resulting impact on detection in high-rate communications, including coding considerations. A link budget and the data rate versus range relationship are developed.

It presents an alternative to classical control methods currently used on the University of Idaho's miniature submarine and underwater crawler. The models of these vehicles are used in training an neural network that optimize the navigation control for the submarine and the track control of the underwater crawler. The effect of using neural networks for the control of such vehicles is its trainability to non-linear systems. Both vehicles operate in transverse conditions and intelligent control is paramount. The underwater conditions can change very rapidly from variables such as environmental aspects to the specific terrain the vehicle is transversing. Because of this environment these controllers should be adaptive to any situation that may arise and thus neural network control is well suited for robust control in this application","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2006.306837","pdfPath":"/iel5/4098824/4098825/04098992.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2006","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2006.306837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4098825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Underwater Autonomous Vehicles Using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4098992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Control of Underwater Autonomous Vehicles Using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9431327","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4098992/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Underwater Autonomous Vehicles Using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"OCEANS-00-167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039223S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4098824","isNumber":"4098825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4098824","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4098825","articleId":"4098992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4098993,"authors":[{"name":"Baosheng Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Baosheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37559017500"},{"name":"Shengli Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Shengli","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37276854700"},{"name":"Milica Stojanovic","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Milica","lastName":"Stojanovic","id":"37266493500"},{"name":"Lee Freitag","affiliation":["Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Lee","lastName":"Freitag","id":"37370518400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0114-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0115-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"4098993","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1048},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Underwater acoustics","Receivers","Decision feedback equalizers","Time varying systems","Dispersion","OFDM modulation","Acoustic testing","Frequency estimation","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-tone based ZP-OFDM demodulation","underwater acoustic channel","coherent underwater acoustic communication systems","single carrier transmission","adaptive decision feedback equalization","time-varying underwater acoustic channel","highly dispersive underwater acoustic channels","equalization complexity","single-carrier approach","channel frequency selectivity","multicarrier modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM blocks","parallel frequency-flat subchannels","receiver equalization","radio channels","zero-padded OFDM transmissions","frequency offset compensation","short data bursts"]}],"abstract":"Existing coherent underwater acoustic communication systems rely on single carrier transmission and adaptive decision feedback equalization to deal with time-varying and highly dispersive underwater acoustic (UWA) channels. Equalization complexity prevents any substantial rate improvement with the existing single-carrier approach, as the channel frequency selectivity increases considerably when the symbol rate increases. Multicarrier modulation in the form of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), on the other hand, converts a frequency selective channel into a set of parallel frequency-flat subchannels, thus greatly simplifying receiver equalization. Motivated by the success of OFDM in radio channels, we investigate its use for underwater acoustic channels. In this paper, we develop a pilot-tone based receiver design for zero-padded OFDM transmissions, and test it in a real underwater acoustic channel. Our proposed receiver performs carrier frequency offset compensation, channel estimation, and data demodulation on the basis of individual OFDM block. This approach is appealing to applications with short data bursts, or fast varying channels, as it does not rely on channel dependence across OFDM blocks","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-tone based ZP-OFDM Demodulation for an Underwater Acoustic Channel","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2006","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2006.306838","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2006","pdfPath":"/iel5/4098824/4098825/04098993.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2006.306838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4098825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4098993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4098993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-tone based ZP-OFDM Demodulation for an Underwater Acoustic Channel","conferenceDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4098993/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9431328","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-tone based ZP-OFDM Demodulation for an Underwater Acoustic Channel","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"OCEANS-00-168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075973S","chronDate":"18-21 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4098824","isNumber":"4098825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4098824","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4098825","articleId":"4098993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4098996,"authors":[{"name":"Namik Kemal Yilmaz","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Namik Kemal","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"38129254800"},{"name":"Constantinos Evangelinos","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"Constantinos","lastName":"Evangelinos","id":"37267932800"},{"name":"Nicholas M.

Due to its high attenuation in water, a radio frequency (RF) carrier is not the optimum choice. Acoustic techniques have made tremendous progress in establishing wireless underwater links, but they are ultimately limited in bandwidth. A third option is optical radiation, which is discussed in this paper. One drawback of underwater wireless optical communications is that the transmission of the optical carrier is highly dependent on water type.

Work reported is based on sonar data collected by the Volume Search Sonar (VSS), one of the five sonar systems in the AN/AQS-20. Our technique is based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), a time-frequency analysis tool which has become attractive in signal processing. Because FrFT uses linear chirps as basis functions, this approach is better suited for sonar applications. The magnitude of the bottom impulse response is given by the magnitude of the Fractional Fourier transform for optimal order applied to the bottom return signal. Joint time-frequency representations of the signal offer the possibility to determine the time-frequency configuration of the signal as its characteristic features for classification purposes. The classification is based on singular value decomposition of the Choi William distribution applied to the impulse response obtained using Fractional Fourier transform. The set of the singular values represents the desired feature vectors that describe the properties of the signal. The singular value spectrum has a high data reduction potential. It encodes the following signal features: time-bandwidth product, frequency versus time dependence, number of signal components and their spacing. The spectrum is invariant to shifts of the signal in time and frequency and is well suited for pattern recognition and classification tasks. The most relevant features (singular values) have been mapped in a reduced dimension space where an unsupervised classification has been employed for acoustic seabed sediment classification. The theoretical method is addressed and then tested on field sonar data. In our classification we used the central beams. Good agreement between the experimental results and the ground truth is shown. A performance comparison of our method to a k-means based technique is also given.

Although the underwater channel impulse response extent can span tens to hundreds of symbols, it is generally sparse in nature and well suited for sparse partial response equalization (sPRE). This equalization scheme, which is not restricted to MIMO configurations, does not attempt to suppress intersymbol interference completely, rather it retains residual ISI in a controlled manner. This is accomplished by setting a sparse residual impulse response target generally similar in magnitude and time to the dominant, yet also sparse, arrivals within the actual channel impulse response. The resultant partial response equalizer is followed by a complexity-reduction detection scheme known as \"belief propagation (BP)\" which is an alternative to the optimal Viterbi or MAP (maximum a-posteriori probability) detector. The complexity of the optimal schemes grows exponentially with the total number of taps, regardless of structure; whereas the complexity of BP grows exponentially only with the non-zero taps. Thus the entire receiver structure, sPRE followed by BP, is suitable for the long, sparse channels since it allows more efficient exploitation of the channel structure. The proposed symbol recovery scheme was applied to data collected during a comprehensive multi-institution MIMO Experiment conducted within the Makai Experiment in 2005 off the northwest coast of Kauai, Hawaii.

This hybrid system combines the advantages of low false-positive rate of signature-based intrusion detection system (IDS) and the ability of anomaly detection system (ADS) to detect novel unknown attacks. By mining anomalous traffic episodes from Internet connections, we build an ADS that detects anomalies beyond the capabilities of signature-based SNORT or Bro systems. A weighted signature generation scheme is developed to integrate ADS with SNORT by extracting signatures from anomalies detected. HIDS extracts signatures from the output of ADS and adds them into the SNORT signature database for fast and accurate intrusion detection. By testing our HIDS scheme over real-life Internet trace data mixed with 10 days of Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) attack data set, our experimental results show a 60 percent detection rate of the HIDS, compared with 30 percent and 22 percent in using the SNORT and Bro systems, respectively. This sharp increase in detection rate is obtained with less than 3 percent false alarms. The signatures generated by ADS upgrade the SNORT performance by 33 percent. The HIDS approach proves the vitality of detecting intrusions and anomalies, simultaneously, by automated data mining and signature generation over Internet connection episodes","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/4099185/04099191.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2007.9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2007.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4099191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Intrusion Detection with Weighted Signature Generation over Anomalous Internet Episodes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Hybrid power systems","Internet","Data mining","Telecommunication traffic","Computer networks","Security","Databases","System testing","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signatures","Internet","security of data","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted signature generation","hybrid intrusion detection system","signature-based intrusion detection system","anomaly detection system","anomalous traffic episode mining","signature extraction","signature database","Internet trace data","automated data mining","Internet connection episode"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network security","intrusion detection systems","anomaly detection","signature generation","SNORT and Bro systems","false alarms","Internet episodes","traffic data mining."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099191/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Intrusion Detection with Weighted Signature Generation over Anomalous Internet Episodes","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4099191/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2007","accessionNumber":"9357918","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Intrusion Detection with Weighted Signature Generation over Anomalous Internet Episodes","sourcePdf":"q0041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119144S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"4099185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4099185","articleId":"4099191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4099192,"authors":[{"name":"Antoine Scherrer","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Physique and the Laboratoire dInformatique du Parall\u00e9lisme, ENS de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/4099185/4099192/4099192-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antoine Scherrer received the master's degree in computer sciences from the University of Lyon in 2003.

First, we propose the use of a non-Gaussian long-range dependent process to model Internet traffic aggregated time series. We give the definitions and intuition behind the use of this model. We detail numerical procedures that can be used to synthesize artificial traffic exactly following the model prescription. We also propose original and practically effective procedures to estimate the corresponding parameters from empirical data. We show that this empirical model relevantly describes a large variety of Internet traffic, including both regular traffic obtained from public reference repositories and traffic containing legitimate (flash crowd) or illegitimate (DDoS attack) anomalies. We observe that the proposed model accurately fits the data for a wide range of aggregation levels. The model provides us with a meaningful multiresolution (i.e., aggregation level dependent) statistics to characterize the traffic: the evolution of the estimated parameters with respect to the aggregation level. It opens the track to the second goal of the paper: anomaly detection. We propose the use of a quadratic distance computed on these statistics to detect the occurrences of DDoS attack and study the statistical performance of these detection procedures.

SC-FDMA has similar throughput performance and essentially the same overall complexity as OFDMA. A principal advantage of SC-FDMA is the peak-to-average power ratio (PARR), which is lower than that of OFDMA. SC FDMA is currently a strong candidate for the uplink multiple access scheme in the long term evolution of cellular systems under consideration by the third generation partnership project (3GPP). In this paper, we give an overview of SC-FDMA. We also analyze the effects of subcarrier mapping on throughput and PARR. Among the possible subcarrier mapping approaches, we find that localized FDMA (LFDMA) with channel-dependent scheduling (CDS) results in higher throughput than interleaved FDMA (JFDMA). However, the PARR performance of IFDMA is better than that of LFDMA.

The measured capacitance depends on a variety of factors related to the cell, its growth environment and the supporting substrate. These include membrane integrity, morphology, extracellular ionic concentration, adhesion strength, and substrate proximity. The measured capacitance is an indication of both the interaction between cells and substrate and cell health. The capacitance sensor uses the principle of charge sharing and translates sensed capacitance values to output voltages. The sensor chip has been fabricated in a commercially available 0.5-mum, 2-poly 3-metal CMOS technology.

The composite actuator consists of expandable microspheres incorporated in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix and entails the merits of both PDMS and expandable microspheres. The main characteristic of the composite actuator is to expand upon heat. The expansion is irreversible and the relative volume increase is measured up to 270% of its original volume after heating to 80 degC. The composite was used to fabricate single-use microfluidic pumps and valves. We show the displacement of liquids in the range of nanoliters even against counter pressures up to 100 kPa. Moreover, liquid flow in microchannels was entirely blocked by means of the integrated valves. The valves can withstand pressures up to 140 kPa. The devices are fabricated using low-cost materials only, and the composite actuator allows using wafer-level processing.

Its complexity is KT(n,3n), where K is the length of the absolute phase domain measured in 2pi units and T(n,m) is the complexity of a max-flow computation in a graph with n nodes and m edges. For nonconvex clique potentials, often used owing to their discontinuity preserving ability, we face an NP-hard problem for which we devise an approximate solution. Both algorithms solve integer optimization problems by computing a sequence of binary optimizations, each one solved by graph cut techniques. Accordingly, we name the two algorithms PUMA, for phase unwrapping max-flow/min-cut.

Instead of postulating a statistical model for the wavelet coefficients, we directly parametrize the denoising process as a sum of elementary nonlinear processes with unknown weights. We then minimize an estimate of the mean square error between the clean image and the denoised one. The key point is that we have at our disposal a very accurate, statistically unbiased, MSE estimate-Stein's unbiased risk estimate-that depends on the noisy image alone, not on the clean one. Like the MSE, this estimate is quadratic in the unknown weights, and its minimization amounts to solving a linear system of equations. The existence of this a priori estimate makes it unnecessary to devise a specific statistical model for the wavelet coefficients. Instead, and contrary to the custom in the literature, these coefficients are not considered random any more. We describe an interscale orthonormal wavelet thresholding algorithm based on this new approach and show its near-optimal performance-both regarding quality and CPU requirement-by comparing it with the results of three state-of-the-art nonredundant denoising algorithms on a large set of test images. An interesting fallout of this study is the development of a new, group-delay-based, parent-child prediction in a wavelet dyadic tree","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New SURE Approach to Image Denoising: Interscale Orthonormal Wavelet Thresholding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.891064","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4099383/04099398.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.891064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4099398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","displayDocTitle":"A New SURE Approach to Image Denoising: Interscale Orthonormal Wavelet Thresholding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4099398/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9318240","pubMedId":"17357721","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New SURE Approach to Image Denoising: Interscale Orthonormal Wavelet Thresholding","sourcePdf":"16tip03-luisier.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077759S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4099383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"414","xplore-issue":"4099383","articleId":"4099398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4099402,"authors":[{"name":"Bahram Parvin","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4099383/4099402/4099402-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bahram Parvin (S'78\u2013M'82\u2013SM'98) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1991.","He is the Head of Imaging and Informatics, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, and an Adjunct Professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Riverside, where he teaches graduate courses on bioimaging and systems biology.

A unique aspect of the technique is the kernel topography, which is refined and reoriented iteratively. The technique can cluster and group nonconvex perceptual circular symmetries along the radial line of an object's shape. It has an excellent noise immunity and is shown to be tolerant to perturbation in scale. The application of this technique to images obtained through various modes of microscopy is demonstrated.

In this paper, we focus on the optical proximity correction mask design problem for \"optical microlithography,\" a process similar to photographic printing used for transferring binary circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. We consider the idealized case of an incoherent imaging system and solve an inverse problem which is an approximation of the real-world optical lithography problem.

Tian's difference-expansion technique is a high-capacity, reversible method for data embedding. However, the method suffers from undesirable distortion at low embedding capacities and lack of capacity control due to the need for embedding a location map. We propose a histogram shifting technique as an alternative to embedding the location map. The proposed technique improves the distortion performance at low embedding capacities and mitigates the capacity control problem. We also propose a reversible data-embedding technique called prediction-error expansion. This new technique better exploits the correlation inherent in the neighborhood of a pixel than the difference-expansion scheme. Prediction-error expansion and histogram shifting combine to form an effective method for data embedding. The experimental results for many standard test images show that prediction-error expansion doubles the maximum embedding capacity when compared to difference expansion.

Different from traditional methods, which use motion features to detect vehicles, this method introduces a new color transform model to find important \"vehicle color\" for quickly locating possible vehicle candidates. Since vehicles have various colors under different weather and lighting conditions, seldom works were proposed for the detection of vehicles using colors. The proposed new color transform model has excellent capabilities to identify vehicle pixels from background, even though the pixels are lighted under varying illuminations. After finding possible vehicle candidates, three important features, including corners, edge maps, and coefficients of wavelet transforms, are used for constructing a cascade multichannel classifier. According to this classifier, an effective scanning can be performed to verify all possible candidates quickly. The scanning process can be quickly achieved because most background pixels are eliminated in advance by the color feature. Experimental results show that the integration of global color features and local edge features is powerful in the detection of vehicles. The average accuracy rate of vehicle detection is 94.9%","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.891147","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4099383/04099411.pdf","startPage":"850","endPage":"864","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.891147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Detection Using Normalized Color and Edge Map","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Detection Using Normalized Color and Edge Map","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9318261","pubMedId":"17357742","publicationDate":"March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4099411/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Detection Using Normalized Color and Edge Map","sourcePdf":"16tip03-tsai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115696S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4099383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"4099383","articleId":"4099411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4099412,"authors":[{"name":"Chengyi Xiong","affiliation":["Institute of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","College of Electronic Information Engineering, South Central University of Nationalities, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4099383/4099412/4099412-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chengyi Xiong received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 1992, the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from the South-Center University for Nationalities (SCUEC), Wuhan, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems at Institute of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, in 2006.","He is currently an Associate Professor with SCUEC, China.

An embedded decimation technique is exploited to optimize the architecture for 1-D DWT, which is designed to receive an input and generate an output with the low- and high-frequency components of original data being available alternately. Based on this 1-D DWT architecture, an efficient line-based architecture for 2-D DWT is further proposed by employing parallel and pipeline techniques, which is mainly composed of two horizontal filter modules and one vertical filter module, working in parallel and pipeline fashion with 100% hardware utilization.

Borrowed from the wireless world, FEC was initially introduced in wavelength-division multiplex (WDM) optical-systems to combat amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), a form of noise native in optical amplifiers (OAs). These first generation FEC systems have been associated with a coding-gain of approximately 6 dB.

Our goal is to design codeword lengths of block source and channel encoders, and a controller to meet a model matching performance objective. Such design problems are difficult in general, as there is a strong interplay between control objectives and communication constraints, which forces the synthesis of controllers and encoder-decoder pairs to be done simultaneously. Current approaches typically fix one, while the other is designed to meet some objective. We first construct a model matching performance metric that captures the tradeoffs between coding the reference command to achieve more accuracy at the remote site and designing a controller to meet performance. We then simultaneously synthesize the controller and encoder codeword lengths that meet the specified objective for a first-order plant and model case.

A general framework for this problem is to work on sources that are sparse in some signal representation domain. Recently, two methods have been proposed with respect to the time-frequency (TF) domain. The first uses quadratic time-frequency distributions (TFDs) and a clustering approach, and the second uses a linear TFD. Both of these methods assume that the sources are disjoint in the TF domain; i.e., there is, at most, one source present at a point in the TF domain. In this paper, we relax this assumption by allowing the sources to be TF-nondisjoint to a certain extent. In particular, the number of sources present at a point is strictly less than the number of sensors. The separation can still be achieved due to subspace projection that allows us to identify the sources present and to estimate their corresponding TFD values.

Large numbers of coefficients are required to retain the desired signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) performance as the operating bandwidth increases. It has been proven that the optimal frequency-dependent array weighting of broadband beamformers could be better approximated by infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters. However, some potential problems, such as stability monitoring and sensitivity to quantization errors, of the IIR filters make the implementation of the IIR beamformers difficult.

The main contributions in this paper include an improved whitening scheme for estimation of signal subspace, a novel biquadratic contrast function for extraction of independent sources, and an efficient alterative method for joint implementation of a set of approximate diagonalization-structural matrices. Specifically, an improved whitening scheme is first developed by estimating the signal subspace jointly from a set of diagonalization-structural matrices based on the proposed cyclic maximizer of an interesting cost function. Moreover, the globally asymptotical convergence of the proposed cyclic maximizer is analyzed and proved. Next, a novel biquadratic contrast function is proposed for extracting one single independent component from a slice matrix group of any order cumulant of the array signals in the presence of temporally white noise. A fast fixed-point algorithm that is a cyclic minimizer is constructed for searching a minimum point of the proposed contrast function. The globally asymptotical convergence of the proposed fixed-point algorithm is analyzed. Then, multiple independent components are obtained by using repeatedly the proposed fixed-point algorithm for extracting one single independent component, and the orthogonality among them is achieved by the well-known QR factorization.

Much of the work in the literature considers maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. However, the ML estimator given by the location of the peak of a periodogram in the frequency domain shown in D.C. Rife and R. R. Boorstyn, \"Single-tone parameter estimation from discrete-time observations,\" IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. IT-20, pp. 591-598, Sep. 1974, has a very high computational complexity. This paper derives the explicit structure of the ML estimator for data processing in the time domain, assuming only reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The result of this approximate ML estimator shows that both the phase and the magnitude of the noisy signal samples are utilized in the estimator, and the phase data alone as assumed in S. A. Tretter, \"Estimating the frequency of a noisy sinusoid by linear regression\", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. IT-31, pp. 832-835, Nov. 1985 and S. Kay, \"A fast and accurate single frequency estimator\", IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, vol. 39, pp. 1203-1205, May 1991, is not a sufficient statistic. The sample-by-sample iterative processing nature of the estimator enables us to propose a novel, recursive phase-unwrapping algorithm that allows the estimator to be implemented efficiently. To facilitate the performance analysis, a new, linearized observation model for the instantaneous signal phase that is more accurate than that of S. A. Tretter, \"Estimating the frequency of a noisy sinusoid by linear regression\", IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. IT-31, pp. 832-835, Nov. 1985 and of S. Kay, \"A fast and accurate single frequency estimator\", vol. 39, pp. 1203-1205, May 1991, is proposed. This new model explains physically why the phase data are weighted by the magnitude information in the ML estimator. Moreover, by incorporating a priori knowledge via the a priori probability density function of the unknown frequency and the carrier phase, the explicit structure of the approximate maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimator is derived, and the Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) on the mean-square error (mse) is obtained. Our analysis shows that the mse performance of the MAP estimator can approach the BCRLB very closely","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4099540/04099556.pdf","startPage":"834","endPage":"845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.888055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.888055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4099556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAP/ML Estimation of the Frequency and Phase of a Single Sinusoid in Noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Phase estimation","Phase noise","Linear regression","Signal processing algorithms","Recursive estimation","Performance analysis","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","iterative methods","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAP estimation","ML estimation","single sinusoid phase","additive white Gaussian noise","maximum likelihood estimation","data processing","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","sample-by-sample iterative processing","recursive phase-unwrapping algorithm","a priori probability density function","maximum a posteriori probability estimator","Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound","mean-square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cramer\u2013Rao lower bound (CRLB)/Bayesian Cramer\u2013Rao lower bound (BCRLB)","frequency","maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)/maximum likelihood (ML) estimation","phase","phase noise model","phase unwrapping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","displayDocTitle":"MAP/ML Estimation of the Frequency and Phase of a Single Sinusoid in Noise","volume":"55","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9318098","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAP/ML Estimation of the Frequency and Phase of a Single Sinusoid in Noise","sourcePdf":"55tsp03-fu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035727S","chronDate":"March  2007","isNumber":"4099540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"76","articleId":"4099556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4099559,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangyuan Li","affiliation":["Electronic and Information School, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4099540/4099559/4099559-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiangyuan Li received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from South China University of Technology (SCUT), Guangzhou, in 2001.

Except for the uDFB, each DFB in this class can be used to decompose an image yielding up to 12 directions while maintaining perfect reconstruction and maximal decimation. A multiresolution representation can be obtained by repeating the same decomposition at the lowpass band. The permissible property of the filter banks in cases of being implemented by a tree structure and by direct implementation is discussed. The result shows that only one DFB in the class, called the uniform quincunx DFB (uqDFB), satisfies the permissible property when being implemented directly without using the tree structure. The nonuniform quincunx DFB (nuqDFB) is then constructed from the uqDFB by merging its two lowpass subbands. An alternative structure for constructing the nuqDFB is presented. The new structure, while yielding the same frequency partitioning, allows the DFB to be realized with complexity comparable to that of the separable wavelet filter bank. The connection between the discrete filter bank and the continuous directional wavelet is also established. Numerical experiments on directional feature extractions, image denoising and nonlinear approximation are presented at the end of the paper to demonstrate the potential of the nuqDFB","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.887140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4099540/04099565.pdf","startPage":"949","endPage":"961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.887140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Class of Multiresolution Directional Filter Banks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4099565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099565/","displayDocTitle":"A Class of Multiresolution Directional Filter Banks","volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9318108","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4099565/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class of Multiresolution Directional Filter Banks","sourcePdf":"55tsp03-nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103424S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4099540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4099540","articleId":"4099565","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4099566,"authors":[{"name":"Nele Noels","affiliation":["Telecommunications and Information Processing Department, Ghent University IMEC, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4099540/4099566/4099566-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nele Noels received the Diploma degree in electrical engineering from Ghent University, Gent, Belgium, in 2001.

We introduce a blockwise forward-backward recursive phase estimator, and we show that the mean-square phase error (MSPE) of the NCA synchronizer equals that of the DA synchronizer when the carrier phase is constant and the loop filter gain is the same for both synchronizers. When the signal is affected by phase noise, the NCA synchronizer (as compared with the DA synchronizer) yields a larger MSPE due to phase fluctuations.

The proposed method may be applied to multilevel/phase data modulations as well as multiuser context. This paper shows that the equalizer behavior may be very reliably predicted totally by calculations (no simulations are needed) whereas that of the decoder still requires simulations. A comparison between the proposed prediction method and plain simulations of the overall turbo equalization scheme demonstrates that our method accurately determines the system performance at any iteration.

For the UWB transceivers to coexist with nearby devices, it is necessary to design efficient UWB receivers whose operation is robust to narrowband interferences (NBI). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis to establish the impacts of NBI on the performance of an OFDM-UWB receiver. A comprehensive study to assess the effects of NBI on the quantization noise in the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), timing, and carrier acquisition is presented. The analytical results show that the efficiency of the ADC is degraded by NBI, although this problem could be slightly remedied by an adaptive autogain controller (AGC). It is also found that, compared with the conventional autocorrelation-based acquisition scheme, the pseudonoise (PN) sequence matched-filtering-based acquisition scheme presents higher robustness to NBI. Nevertheless, both these two acquisition schemes fail at high interference levels. As a conclusion, it is critical to develop novel and low-complexity NBI mitigation schemes for OFDM-UWB receivers that take into account the impacts introduced by NBI","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.887153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4099540/04099573.pdf","startPage":"1118","endPage":"1128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.887153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impacts of Narrowband Interference on OFDM-UWB Receivers: Analysis and Mitigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4099573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099573/","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of Narrowband Interference on OFDM-UWB Receivers: Analysis and Mitigation","volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9318121","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4099573/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impacts of Narrowband Interference on OFDM-UWB Receivers: Analysis and Mitigation","sourcePdf":"55tsp03-shi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07595S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4099540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4099540","articleId":"4099573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4099574,"authors":[{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4099540/4099574/4099574-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaodan Ma received the B.Sc.

Based on some structural properties of the new system model, an equalizer is designed using SOS of the received signals to cancel most of the intersymbol interference. The transmitted signals are then detected from the equalizer output. In the proposed algorithm, only 2P (P is the number of transmit antennas/users in MIMO-OFDM systems) columns of the channel matrix need to be estimated, and channel length estimation is unnecessary, which is an advantage over existing algorithms.

At first, a tight bound on the asymptotic error performance for the general case of precoding over all N subcarriers is derived and used to establish the best achievable asymptotic performance by SSD.

In contrast with the traditional approach where a bank of dedicated parallel access channels (PAC) is used for transmitting the sensor observations to the fusion center, we explore the possibility of employing a shared multiple access channel (MAC), which significantly reduces the bandwidth requirement or detection delay. We assume that local observations are mapped according to a certain function subject to a power constraint. Using the large deviation approach, we demonstrate that for the deterministic signal in correlated noise problem, with a specially chosen mapping rule, MAC fusion achieves the same asymptotic performance as centralized detection under the average power constraint (APC), while there is always a loss in error exponents associated with PAC fusion. Under the total power constraint (TPC), MAC fusion still results in exponential decay in error exponents with the number of sensors, while PAC fusion does not. For the AR signal problem, we propose a suboptimal MAC mapping rule which performs closely to centralized detection for weakly correlated signals at almost all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values, and for heavily correlated signals when SNR is either high or low. Finally, we show that although the lack of MAC synchronization always causes a degradation in error exponents, such degradation is negligible when the phase mismatch among sensors is sufficiently small","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.887563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4099540/04099580.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.887563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099540","startPage":"822","endPage":"833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks Using A Multiple Access Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4099580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks Using A Multiple Access Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099580/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 February 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9318097","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4099580/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks Using A Multiple Access Channel","sourcePdf":"55tsp03-wli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167716S","chronDate":"March  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4099540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4099540","articleId":"4099580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4099581,"authors":[{"name":"Jwo-Yuh Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4099540/4099581/4099581-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jwo-Yuh Wu (M'04) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1996, 1998, and 2002, respectively, all in electrical and control engineering.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University.

The proposed method exploits the precoding-induced linear signal structure in the conjugate cross correlation between the two temporal block received signals as well as the circulant channel matrix property and can yield exact solutions whenever the channel noise is circularly Gaussian and the receive data statistic is perfectly obtained. The channel estimation formulation builds on rearranging the set of linear equations relating the entries of conjugate cross-correlation matrix and products of channel impulse responses into one with a distinctive block-circulant with circulant-block (BCCB) structure. This allows a simple identifiability condition depending on precoder parameters alone and also provides a natural yet effective optimal precoder design framework for improving solution accuracy when imperfect data estimation occurs. We consider two models of data mismatch, from both deterministic and statistical points of view, and propose the associated design criteria. The optimization problems are formulated to take advantage of the BCCB system matrix property and are solved analytically. The proposed optimal precoder aims to optimize solution robustness against deterministic error perturbation and also minimize the mean-square error when the data mismatch is modeled as a white noise. Pairwise error probability analysis is conducted for investigating the equalization performance.

Highly integrated systems are now being designed, many of which are mixed-signal, including analog and/or RF parts. Although the technological roadmap stays on track, the actual design of circuits in 65nm and below becomes a big bottleneck, that may even turn out to be a showstopper, if not addressed properly. Rising design complexities, tightening time-to-market constraints, leakage power, increasing technology tolerances, reducing supply voltages and worsening signal integrity conditions are key challenges that designers face. Novel types of devices, new process materials and new reliability issues are next on the horizon. EDA tools simply have become inevitable to design today's highly integrated systems (SoC or SiP). This invited paper presents an overview of the design methodologies and EDA tools that have been or are being developed to address the problems of designing such mixed-signal integrated systems. In particular, progress is described in modeling and simulation techniques for complex mixed-signal systems, in circuit and layout synthesis tools for analog/RF circuits, in yield optimization as well as in signal integrity analysis methods such as substrate noise and EMC/EMI analysis. This will be illustrated with several practical examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","accessionNumber":"9242260","htmlLink":"/document/4099698/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Design methodologies and tools for circuit design in CMOS nanometer technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design methodologies and tools for circuit design in CMOS nanometer technologies","confLoc":"Montreaux, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"ESSCIR-00-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.146553S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4099684","isNumber":"4099685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4099684","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4099685","articleId":"4099698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4099710,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A complete 2GHz ADPLL test chip has been then integrated and measured showing an in-band phase noise of -102dBc and maximum in-band spurs of -42dBc while consuming 15mW","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIR.2006.307553","publicationTitle":"2006 Proceedings of the 32nd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Proceedings of the 32nd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4099684/4099685/04099726.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIR.2006.307553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099685","startPage":"150","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3MHz Bandwidth Low Noise RF All Digital PLL with 12ps Resolution Time to Digital Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4099726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 3MHz Bandwidth Low Noise RF All Digital PLL with 12ps Resolution Time to Digital Converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099726/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9242267","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4099726/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3MHz Bandwidth Low Noise RF All Digital PLL with 12ps Resolution Time to Digital Converter","confLoc":"Montreaux, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"ESSCIR-00-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060142S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4099684","isNumber":"4099685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4099684","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4099685","articleId":"4099726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4099730,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Yan Yu","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, Poughkeepsie, USA"],"firstName":"Xiao Yan","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085981201"},{"name":"Yiu-hing Chan","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, Poughkeepsie, USA"],"firstName":"Yiu-hing","lastName":"Chan","id":"37437445600"},{"name":"Brian Curran","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, Poughkeepsie, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Curran","id":"37356010100"},{"name":"Eric Schwarz","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, Poughkeepsie, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Schwarz","id":"37357742600"},{"name":"Michael Kelly","affiliation":["IBM Systems and Technology Group, Poughkeepsie, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kelly","id":"38131098800"},{"name":"Bruce Fleischer","affiliation":["IBM T.

The dynamic range (DR) is 95dB over the voice bandwidth of 20-20 000Hz. Furthermore, by using a feed back architecture the need of an anti aliasing filter is eliminated. The input operational amplifier is chopped to eliminate flicker noise and offset. These improvements give way to a substantial simplification of the analog front end by allowing the absorption of the pre-amplifier and the antialiasing filter into the DeltaSigma-ADC. Thanks to the feedback structure the slew rate at the quantizer is limited and a power-efficient tracking ADC can be used. The total harmonic distortion (THD) is below -77dB at maximum input signal of 1.4Vpp. The ADC consumes 2.2mW from a 1.2V supply when clocked at 12MHz.

A novel approach to design a digitally programmable low pass filter (LPF) and variable gain amplifier (VGA) is here defined. These baseband blocks are driven by a network-on-chip that is able to set performances like cut-off frequency, selectivity, noise, and gain conveniently adapting the power consumption. The LPF provides a wide frequency tuning range between 0.35MHz and 23.5MHz with an adaptive integrated noise level between 85muVrms and 163muVrms and a current consumption that moves from 1.5mA to 18mA. The VGA is made up of 2 cascaded gain stages and provides a gain range from 0dB to 39dB. The prototype was realized in 0.13mum CMOS technology.

The main advantage of such linear regulators is the low standby current due to the absence of switching. In addition, a fully integrated linear regulator with no external components is very attractive for applications with stringent area, low weight requirements and relatively small peak power. The architecture of error amplifier used in the feedback loop suffers from an inherent load regulation performance limitation. This limitation manifests itself through the limited DC open-loop gain, and results from limited closed-loop bandwidth. The frequency response of power supply loop is highly sensitive to the load conditions, thus, making proper compensation is a laborious effort. This paper discusses and addresses a new topology of an error amplifier offering a high open loop gain as well as a large band width by adding a zero to its transfer function. Proposed topology uses a compound OTA and OPAMP that enhances load regulation performance by relaxing the dc open-loop gain restrictions. An example of battery charger using this opamp topology is also described in this paper.

The structural features of the bitstream file are used to manage physical area resources to reduce the partial reconfiguration bitstream size. In this approach, instead of relying on the design tools' random placement, most of the logic resources are predetermined at specific physical positions based on several principles. The proposed methodology is evaluated on the Virtex II Pro platform. The result shows file sizes can be reduced up to 30% on a variety of designs compared to non-area managed configurations.

The goal of increasing availability by minimizing the repair time is addressed in this paper using a CGT-pruned genetic algorithm. The proposed method utilizes resource performance information obtained using combinatorial group testing (CGT) techniques to evolve refurbished configurations in fewer generations than conventional genetic algorithms. A 3-bit times 2-bit multiplier circuit was evolved using both conventional and CGT-pruned genetic algorithms. Results show that the new approach yields completely refurbished configurations 37.6% faster than conventional genetic algorithms. In addition it is demonstrated that for the same circuit, refurbishment of partially-functional configurations is a more tractable problem than designing the configurations when using genetic algorithms as results show the former to take 80% fewer generations","doi":"10.1109/RECONF.2006.307760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RECONF.2006.307760","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGA's (ReConFig 2006)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGA's (ReConFig 2006)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4099957/4099958/04099980.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expediting GA-Based Evolution Using Group Testing Techniques for Reconfigurable Hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099980/","displayDocTitle":"Expediting GA-Based Evolution Using Group Testing Techniques for Reconfigurable Hardware","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9253552","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4099980/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expediting GA-Based Evolution Using Group Testing Techniques for Reconfigurable Hardware","confLoc":"San Luis Potosi, Mexico","sourcePdf":"RECONF-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063924S","chronDate":"Sept.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4099957","isNumber":"4099958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4099957","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4099958","articleId":"4099980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4099981,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Pena","affiliation":["Advanced Learning and Research Institute ALaRI, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Pena","id":"38055923900"},{"name":"Mauricio Vanegas","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Group, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellin, Colombia"],"firstName":"Mauricio","lastName":"Vanegas","id":"37596676800"},{"name":"Andres Valencia","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Group, Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Medellin, Colombia"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Valencia","id":"38133870100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0689-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0690-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"4099981","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Self organizing feature maps","Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Network topology","Probability distribution","Unsupervised learning","Neural networks","Computational modeling","Microelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential distribution","neural net architecture","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital hardware architecture","Kohonen self organizing feature map","exponential neighboring function","self-organizing neural network","probability distribution","VHDL simulation","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Kohonen maps are self-organizing neural networks that categorize input data, capturing its topology and probability distribution.

However, in current and emerging generations of digital circuits leakage power is becoming to total energy consumption as important as dynamic power. More portable electronic devices are available everyday. Such devices are using newer semiconductor technologies that allow to fit more transistors per square millimeter. This increase in transistors density produces increases in power and temperature densities. Increases in transistors' temperature exponentially impact the leakage power. For this reason, it is important to consider leakage power consumption in the design of digital systems. In this work we develop the design of a 6T-SRAM cell utilizing two semiconductor technologies and a range of circuit design parameters. We estimate the leakage power for each of the designs.

Working with variant spaces over the visual field has been widely proposed as a way to reduce such information. Foveal vision is one of these proposals by providing a way to transform the visual field obtained with conventional cameras into a sampling with high resolution at the center and decreasing over the periphery such as in mammal vision systems. In this paper, an FPGA based architecture to transform conventional images into foveal images is presented. The hardware algorithm has been taken from new proposal to foveate images. Strategies as parallelism and pipeline are exploited to obtain a high performance and thus, with both of them, reduction in the visual field and the transformation in real time of the digital images into foveal images, a vision system can accelerate its performance and reaches real time restrictions","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based Pipeline Architecture to Transform Cartesian Images into Foveal Images by Using a new Foveation Approach","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGA's (ReConFig 2006)","doi":"10.1109/RECONF.2006.307774","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGA's (ReConFig 2006)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4099957/4099958/04099994.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RECONF.2006.307774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099958","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4099994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based Pipeline Architecture to Transform Cartesian Images into Foveal Images by Using a new Foveation Approach","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4099994/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9242405","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based Pipeline Architecture to Transform Cartesian Images into Foveal Images by Using a new Foveation Approach","confLoc":"San Luis Potosi, Mexico","sourcePdf":"RECONF-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097738S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4099957","isNumber":"4099958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4099957","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4099958","articleId":"4099994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4099995,"authors":[{"name":"Julio C.

However, the results obtained by most optical flow techniques are as accurate as computationally intensive due to the large amount of data involved. A new strategy for image sequence processing has been developed; pixels of the image sequence that significantly change fire the execution of the operations related to the image processing algorithm. The data reduction achieved with this strategy allows a significant optical flow computation speed-up. Furthermore, FPGAs allow the implementation of a custom data-flow architecture specially suited for this strategy. The foundations of the change-driven image processing are presented, as well as the hardware custom implementation in an EP20K1000C FPGA showing the achieved performance","doi":"10.1109/RECONF.2006.307775","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGA's (ReConFig 2006)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGA's (ReConFig 2006)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4099957/4099958/04099995.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4099958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RECONF.2006.307775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Change-driven Image Architecture on FPGA with adaptive threshold for Optical-Flow Computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4099995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Change-driven Image Architecture on FPGA with adaptive threshold for Optical-Flow Computation","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4099995/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9242406","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Change-driven Image Architecture on FPGA with adaptive threshold for Optical-Flow Computation","confLoc":"San Luis Potosi, Mexico","sourcePdf":"RECONF-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10428S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4099957","isNumber":"4099958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4099957","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4099958","articleId":"4099995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
