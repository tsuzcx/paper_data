They present an overview of their research program, focusing on locomotion, perception, planning, and control. They summarize some of the most important goals and requirements of a rover design and describe how locomotion, perception, and planning systems can satisfy these requirements. Since the program is relatively young (one year old at the time of writing) they identify issues and approaches and describe work in progress rather than report results. It is expected that many of the technologies developed will be applicable to other planetary bodies and to terrestrial concerns such as hazardous waste assessment and remediation, ocean floor exploration, and mining.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.30717","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","startPage":"18","endPage":"26","publicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/1318/00030717.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.30717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ambler: an autonomous rover for planetary exploration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mars","Robots","Navigation","Planets","Orbital robotics","Solar system","Remotely operated vehicles","Biological materials","Payloads","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic guided vehicles","computer vision","computerised navigation","mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single leg tested","gait","planetary exploration","legged rover","Ambler","autonomous mobile exploration robot","rugged terrain","Martian surface","locomotion","perception","planning","control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1989","displayDocTitle":"Ambler: an autonomous rover for planetary exploration","volume":"22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3487215","publicationDate":"June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30717/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ambler: an autonomous rover for planetary exploration","sourcePdf":"00030717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040025S","chronDate":"June  1989","isNumber":"1318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"125","articleId":"30717","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":30720,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The occupancy grid is a multidimensional random field that maintains stochastic estimates of the occupancy state of the cells in a spatial lattice. To construct a sensor-derived map of the robot's world, the cell state estimates are obtained by interpreting the incoming range readings using probabilistic sensor models. Bayesian estimation procedures allow the incremental updating of the occupancy grid, using readings taken from several sensors over multiple points of view. The use of occupancy grids from mapping and for navigation is examined.

A powerful neural learning formalism is introduced for addressing a large class of nonlinear mapping problems, including redundant manipulator inverse kinematics, commonly encountered during the design of real-time adaptive control mechanisms. Artificial neural networks with terminal attractor dynamics are used. The rapid network convergence resulting from the infinite local stability of these attractors allows the development of fast neural learning algorithms. Approaches to manipulator inverse kinematics are reviewed, the neurodynamics model is discussed, and the neural learning algorithm is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3487220","volume":"22","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neutral learning of constrained nonlinear transformations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neutral learning of constrained nonlinear transformations","sourcePdf":"00030722.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047945S","chronDate":"June  1989","isNumber":"1318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"65","articleId":"30722","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":30731,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

After determining the equilibrium points of the cooperative system for the case of periodical relative motion, the authors concentrate on the stability of the transient behavior around the equilibrium points for the case of uniform angular relative motion. This case corresponds to an assumption that the steady-state motion is slow with respect to transient phenomena, and is applicable to currently foreseen intersatellite and deep-space optical communications. The analysis is aimed at determining the combined effect of the basic system parameters, such as propagation delay time, tracking loop gains, DC servomotors time constant, and point-ahead velocity error, on the stability and the transient behavior of the overall tracking system. The stability conditions and the transient response around the steady-state trajectory provide a tool for evaluating the consistency of the design parameters for a given propagation delay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.30787","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/1324/00030787.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.30787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1324","startPage":"325","endPage":"334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis of direct-detection cooperative optical beam tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=30787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of direct-detection cooperative optical beam tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30787/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3476940","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of direct-detection cooperative optical beam tracking","sourcePdf":"00030787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049488S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"1324","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"13","articleId":"30787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":30791,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

When a task arrives at a node, the local scheduler at that node attempts to guarantee that the task will complete execution on that node before its deadline. If the attempt fails, the scheduling components on individual nodes cooperate to determine which other node in the system has sufficient resource surplus to guarantee the task. Simulation studies are performed to compare the performance of these algorithms with respect to each other as well to two baselines. The first baseline is the noncooperative algorithm where a task that cannot be guaranteed locally is not sent to any other node. The second is an (ideal) algorithm that behaves exactly like the bidding algorithm but incurs no communication overheads. The simulation studies examine how communication delay, task laxity, load differences on the nodes, and task computation times affect the performance of the algorithms. The results show that distributed scheduling is effective even in a hard real-time environment and that the relative performance of these algorithms is a function of the system state.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed scheduling of tasks with deadlines and resource requirements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.30866","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1328/00030866.pdf","startPage":"1110","endPage":"1123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.30866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1328","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=30866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30866/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Distributed scheduling of tasks with deadlines and resource requirements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3466007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed scheduling of tasks with deadlines and resource requirements","sourcePdf":"00030866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039458S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"219","articleId":"30866","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":30867,"authors":[{"name":"K.G.

Whenever the state of a node changes from underloaded to fully loaded and vice versa, the node broadcasts this change to a set of nodes, called a buddy set, in the system. The performance of the method is evaluated with both analytic modeling and simulation. It is modeled first by an embedded Markov chain for which numerical solutions are derived. The model solutions are then used to calculate the distribution of queue lengths at the nodes and the probability of meeting tasks deadlines. The analytical results show that buddy sets of ten nodes outperform those of less than ten nodes, and the incremental benefit gained from increasing the buddy set size beyond 15 nodes is insignificant. These and other analytical results are verified by simulation. The proposed LS method is shown to meet task deadlines with a very high probability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.30867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/1328/00030867.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.30867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1328","startPage":"1124","endPage":"1142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load sharing in distributed real-time systems with state-change broadcasts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=30867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Load sharing in distributed real-time systems with state-change broadcasts","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3466008","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load sharing in distributed real-time systems with state-change broadcasts","sourcePdf":"00030867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041733S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"95","articleId":"30867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":30888,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Unlike the ordinary charge and discharge processes in polymer dielectrics, anomalous behavior was observed for copolymers of VDF and TrFE with varied comonomer content in which a current peak took place in a discharge process. The peak time, i.e., the time elapsed for the current peak to appear in a discharge transient, depended strongly on temperature and the applied field. The higher the temperature and the lower the field on charging, the shorter was the peak time. This unusual discharge process showing a current peak occurred at higher temperatures above the ferroelectric to paraelectric transition or the Curie transition of the VDF/TrFE copolymer, being much suppressed in electrodialyzed samples with less ionic impurity. Thus the anomalous discharge process is probably connected with a retarded discharge process of ionic charge bound in the paraelectric phase of the copolymer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/14.30888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/1329/00030888.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.30888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1329","startPage":"449","endPage":"455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous discharge current in copolymers of vinylidenefluoride and trifluoroethylene","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=30888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous discharge current in copolymers of vinylidenefluoride and trifluoroethylene","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3476998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous discharge current in copolymers of vinylidenefluoride and trifluoroethylene","sourcePdf":"00030888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036476S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"7","articleId":"30888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":30920,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.L.

The circuit worthiness of the process is demonstrated by fabricating CMOS, vertical n-p-n RTL, and vertical p-n-p RTL ring oscillators, and demonstrating high yields for these circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.30942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/1331/00030942.pdf","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.30942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A BiCMOS process utilizing selective epitaxy for analog/digital applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=30942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30942/","displayDocTitle":"A BiCMOS process utilizing selective epitaxy for analog/digital applications","volume":"36","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3456425","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A BiCMOS process utilizing selective epitaxy for analog/digital applications","sourcePdf":"00030942.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074862S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"8","articleId":"30942","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":30945,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The devices are packaged and interconnected with special attention to materials choices to assure reliability of the connection structures. Laboratory cryogenic cycling studies at the device and printed-circuit-board levels are reported. Heat-transfer experiments conducted to validate nucleate boiling peak heat-flux limits of approximately 12 W/cm/sup 2/ in liquid nitrogen are described. A vacuum-jacketed cryostat vessel provides the central processor chips with their liquid-nitrogen environment and allows several thousand signal wires to connect to them with minimal heat leak.

The lowest temperature at which proper circuit operation was observed was 89 K for the 256-kb units. It is believed that below this temperature the sense circuits fail. Above a critical temperature, typically about 240 K, but dependent on the device family, the minimum refresh frequency is determined from the Shockley-Hall-Read electron generation rate, which is strongly temperature dependent. Below this temperature, the minimum refresh frequency is temperature independent but strongly voltage dependent and results from band-to-band tunneling in the Si depletion region under the capacitor. Times between required refresh cycles as long as 4.6 days have been observed at 183 K. These results suggested that DRAMs specifically designed for low-temperature operation can be operated at or near liquid-nitrogen temperature and as static RAMs with a reduction in circuit complexity and in power dissipation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.30954","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00030954.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/1332/00030954.pdf","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.30954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=30954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-temperature operation of silicon dynamic random-access memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30954/","displayDocTitle":"Low-temperature operation of silicon dynamic random-access memories","volume":"36","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3488911","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-temperature operation of silicon dynamic random-access memories","sourcePdf":"00030954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031266S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"20","articleId":"30954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":30966,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.G.

The model has been used in the past to describe radar targets that are rough compared to the wavelength of the transmitted radiation. Without specifying precisely what the transmitted signal is, a general estimation-based procedure is derived for obtaining images. After discretizing the model, the radar imaging problem reduces to the task of estimating discretized second-order statistics of the reflectance process of the target.

Attention is focused on the ability to store a prescribed set of state vectors as attractors within the model. Within the framework of such associative nets, a specific strategy for information storage that utilizes the spectrum of a linear operator is considered in some detail. Comparisons are made between this spectral strategy and a prior scheme that utilizes the sum of Kronecker outer products of the prescribed set of state vectors, which are to function nominally as memories. The storage capacity of the spectral strategy is linear in n (the dimension of the state space under consideration), whereas an asymptotic result of n/4 log n holds for the storage capacity of the outer product scheme. Computer-simulated results show that the spectral strategy stores information more efficiently. The preprocessing costs incurred in the two algorithms are estimated, and recursive strategies are developed for their computation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00030977.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1333/00030977.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.30977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.30977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=30977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear and logarithmic capacities in associative neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Neurons","Vectors","Computer networks","Distributed computing","Associative memory","State-space methods","Biological system modeling","Linearity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear capacity","logarithmic capacity","associative neural networks","associate memory","global linearity","pointwise nonlinearities","state space","n-dimensional binary vectors","attractors","information storage","spectral strategy","Kronecker outer products","state vectors","storage capacity","preprocessing costs","recursive strategies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Linear and logarithmic capacities in associative neural networks","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3465984","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear and logarithmic capacities in associative neural networks","sourcePdf":"00030977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059825S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"1333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"56","articleId":"30977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":30979,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Frame synchronism refers to the ability of the transmitters to send their code words in unison. The absence of frame synchronism in memoryless multiple-access channels is known to result in the removal of the convex hull operation from the expression of the capacity region. It is shown that when the channel has memory, frame asynchronism rules out nonstationary inputs to achieve any point in the capacity region, thereby allowing only coding strategies that involve cooperation in the frequency domain but not in the time domain. This restriction drastically reduces the capacity region of some multiple-access channels with memory, and in particular the total capacity of the channel, which is invariant to frame asynchronism for memoryless channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.30983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.30983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1333/00030983.pdf","startPage":"605","endPage":"619","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00030983.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-access channels with memory with and without frame synchronism","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/30983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-access channels with memory with and without frame synchronism","volume":"35","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1989","accessionNumber":"3476787","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-access channels with memory with and without frame synchronism","sourcePdf":"00030983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048572S","chronDate":"May 1989","isNumber":"1333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"69","articleId":"30983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":30984,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The resulting costs are finite. The sufficient conditions are based on concepts of absolute controllability and observability of the jump linear system. This JLQBSP controller requires less precise information about form transition probabilities (only the directed interaction matrix is needed) and provides reliable control in all circumstances. Consequently, sometimes it is more appropriate for potential applications than JLQ control algorithms that are optimal in only an average sense.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March-April 1989","accessionNumber":"3489081","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bounded sample path control of discrete time jump linear systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounded sample path control of discrete time jump linear systems","sourcePdf":"00031033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025645S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","isNumber":"1335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"15","articleId":"31033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":31034,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The problems under consideration are computationally difficult in that multiple disorders may occur simultaneously and a global optimum in the space exponential to the total number of possible disorders is sought as a solution. To solve this problem, global optimization criteria are decomposed into local optimization criteria that are used to govern node activation updating in the connectionist model. Nodes representing disorders compete with each other to account for each 'individual' present manifestation, yet complement each other to account for all present manifestation, yet complement each other to account for all present manifestations through parallel node interactions. When equilibrium is reached, the network settles into a locally optimal state in which some disorder nodes (winners) are fully activated and compose the diagnosis for the given case, while all other disorder nodes are fully deactivated. A resettling process is proposed to improve accuracy. Three randomly generated examples of diagnostic problems, each of which has 1024 cases, were tested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/1335/00031034.pdf","doi":"10.1109/21.31034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.31034","startPage":"285","endPage":"298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A connectionist model for diagnostic problem solving","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31034/","displayDocTitle":"A connectionist model for diagnostic problem solving","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"3489082","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March-April 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A connectionist model for diagnostic problem solving","sourcePdf":"00031034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047155S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","isNumber":"1335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"91","articleId":"31034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":31035,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

Neural networks consist of a collection of interconnected processors that compute in parallel. The parallelism allows the network to examine various constraints simultaneously during the learning phase and enables reductions in computing time that are attractive in real-time applications. The learning abilities of these networks in a tuning operation are discussed. The network learns by observing the effect of the input variables of the operation (such as feed rate, depth of cut, and cutting speed) on the output variables (such as cutting force, power, temperature, and surface finish of the workpiece). The learning phase is followed by a synthesis phase during which the network predicts the input conditions to be used by the machine tool to maximize the metal removal rate subject to appropriate operating constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.31035","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"299","endPage":"314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/1335/00031035.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.31035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning and optimization of machining operations using computing abilities of neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machining","Neural networks","Network synthesis","Computer networks","Concurrent computing","Feedforward neural networks","Parallel processing","Input variables","Feeds","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","manufacturing computer control","neural nets","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task synthesis","machine learning","artificial intelligence","parallel processing","manufacturing computer control","machining operations","neural networks","learning phase"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"Learning and optimization of machining operations using computing abilities of neural networks","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3489083","publicationDate":"March-April 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31035/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning and optimization of machining operations using computing abilities of neural networks","sourcePdf":"00031035.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032654S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","isNumber":"1335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"114","articleId":"31035","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":31036,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

Earlier applications of backpropagation to modeling and to EIA problems are reviewed that antedate the practical applications to neural networks. Finally, the relations between backpropagation, the current EIA model, and economic issues related to modeling and the gas industry are discussed. Among these issues are optimization subject to constraints, and competition and efficiency in gas supply. It is also shown how more recent formulations of backpropagation are a special case of the proposed formulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.31036","startPage":"315","endPage":"333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.31036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1335","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/1335/00031036.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing long-term gas industry profits in two minutes in Lotus using neural network methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31036/","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing long-term gas industry profits in two minutes in Lotus using neural network methods","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3489084","publicationDate":"March-April 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing long-term gas industry profits in two minutes in Lotus using neural network methods","sourcePdf":"00031036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043834S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1989","isNumber":"1335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"37","articleId":"31036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":31043,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Through a nonlinear transformation, these models can be converted to an equivalent system of differential equations whose state variables correspond to firing rates. The firing rate formulation has certain computational advantages over the potential formulation of the model. The computational and storage burdens per cycle in simulations are reduced, and the resulting equations become quasilinear in a large significant subset of the state space. Moreover, the dynamic range of the state space is bounded, alleviating the numerical stability problems in network simulation. These advantages are demonstrated through an example, using the authors' model for the so-called neural solution to the traveling salesman problem proposed by J.J. Hopfield and D.W.

This linearizer, which is based upon the cuber linearizer technique, utilizes circulators and a pair of diodes in the distortion generator to obtain high signal component isolation, and in the variable phase shifter to compensate for temperature variations. This allows miniaturization and easy adjustment of the circuit. Results show that a distortion reduction of more than 10 dB is obtained over a 300 MHz bandwidth.

The fundamental characteristics of the linearizer and its effect on the 256-QAM signal are shown. The results show an improvement of more than 6 dB in the output back-off of the amplifier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.31085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1337/00031085.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.31085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1337","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel linearizer using balanced circulators and its application to multilevel digital radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel linearizer using balanced circulators and its application to multilevel digital radio systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3476825","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel linearizer using balanced circulators and its application to multilevel digital radio systems","sourcePdf":"00031085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032186S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"43","articleId":"31085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":31087,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These uniplanar MMIC frequency doublers offer the advantages of smaller circuit size and simpler fabrication processes than microstrip-based MMICs. The fabricated doublers achieve a conversion gain of 2.9 dB at 12.4 GHz and a minimum conversion loss of 0.7 dB at 24.4 GHz.

Effectively, the aim is to add the wanted signal vectors in a maximum ratio sense, while interferers are weighted so that their resultant is in a permanent deep fade. Even if there are not enough degrees of freedom available to accomplish this fully, an optimum solution can still be found. Many interpretations from conventional array technology do not apply to the mobile communications case and the mechanism of optimum combining for array branch signals rather than discrete spatial signals is reviewed. Physical interpretation of the formulation is emphasized throughout. Problems with the adaptive algorithm and its implementation are also identified. Sample matrix inversion is shown to be a likely algorithm to apply in vehicular mobile communications receivers. A worst case example gives an idea of the required computation rates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/1340/00031122.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.31122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.31122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimum combining at the mobile","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Mobile communication","Mobile antennas","Adaptive arrays","Base stations","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Adaptive algorithm","Communication switching","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","fading","mobile antennas","mobile radio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","optimum combining","diversity antennas","array branch signals","adaptive algorithm","matrix inversion","vehicular mobile communications receivers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1988","displayDocTitle":"On optimum combining at the mobile","volume":"37","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","accessionNumber":"3456705","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimum combining at the mobile","sourcePdf":"00031122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025533S","chronDate":"Nov 1988","isNumber":"1340","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","articleId":"31122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":31123,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Noncoherent (differential and frequency) demodulation is assumed. In the general combiner, the output of each branch demodulator is weighted by the nu th power of the demodulator input signal envelope (weighting factor). The optimum weighting factor is found to be nu =2. It is shown that postdetection general combiners using weighting factors of nu =1 and 2 correspond to predetection equal-gain and maximal-ratio combiners, respectively. A closed-form solution and a fairly simple expression are derived for the average bit error rate.

In the absence of frequency uncertainty, it is shown that the tracking error can be modeled as an ergodic Markov chain with a finite-state set, and the probability density function of the steady-state tracking error is evaluated. When there is a frequency uncertainty, the dynamics of the resulting nonstationary phase error can be obtained, and an expression to evaluate the probability distribution of the first time at which the phase error hits predetermined boundary values is derived.

The authors show that this error multiplex effect is mainly caused by the coding of signal points and by hardware imperfections such as carrier and clock phase jitter, nonideal regenerator threshold voltages, etc. They derive the mathematical tools necessary for calculation of the bit error structure at the modem output under optimum and nonoptimum receiver conditions. It is shown how the errors are distributed among the demultiplexer channels. QAM space diagrams of distorted signals are used for calculation of the BERs in the subsystems. Some experimental results emphasize the fact that the multiplex equipment must not be excluded from design considerations for QAM modems. The 16- and 64-QAM systems are compared with respect to their susceptibility to the error multiplex effect, and a scrambling technique is proposed as a possible means to reduce the BER differences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.31147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1342/00031147.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.31147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1342","startPage":"626","endPage":"634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of coding and hardware imperfections on the bit error structure of multilevel QAM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of coding and hardware imperfections on the bit error structure of multilevel QAM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3456891","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of coding and hardware imperfections on the bit error structure of multilevel QAM systems","sourcePdf":"00031147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025741S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","articleId":"31147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":31150,"authors":[{"name":"Y.T.

It comprises a whitened-matched filter and a trellis decoder which combines the previously separated functions of equalization and trellis-coded modulation (TCM) decoding. TCM encoder, transmission channel, and whitened-matched filter are modeled by a single finite-state machine with combined intersymbol interference and code states. Using ISI-state truncation techniques and the set-partitioning principles inherent in TCM, a systematic method is then developed for reducing the state complexity of the corresponding ISI and code trellis. A modified branch metric is used for canceling those ISI terms which are not represented by the trellis states. The approach leads to a family of Viterbi decoders which offer a tradeoff between decoding complexity and performance. An adaptive version of the proposed receiver is discussed, and an efficient structure for reduced-state decoding is given. Simulation results are presented for channels with severe amplitude and phase distortion. It is shown that the proposed receiver achieves a significant gain in noise margin over a conventional receiver which uses separate linear equalization and TCM decoding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.31158","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1343/00031158.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.31158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"669","endPage":"676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Decoding of trellis-encoded signals in the presence of intersymbol interference and noise","volume":"37","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3477123","publicationDate":"July 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding of trellis-encoded signals in the presence of intersymbol interference and noise","sourcePdf":"00031158.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063567S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"212","articleId":"31158","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":31163,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The signal of interest is a wideband direct-sequence spread-spectrum signal (DS-SS). The interference is a narrowband signal which may be of high power and which is either intentionally or unintentionally collocated in frequency and interfering with the signal of interest. The effect of windowing the input signal by a rectangular or Hamming windows as well as the use of an overlap and save scheme is presented. It is shown that the Hamming window far outperforms the rectangular window, and that the interference is for all purposes completely eliminated when the Hamming window is used in conjunction with the overlap and save scheme. The criterion used to evaluate the effectiveness of the different interference rejection techniques is the bit error rate (BER) as measured at the output of the demodulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00031163.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1343/00031163.pdf","startPage":"713","endPage":"722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.31163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.31163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrow-band interference rejection using real-time Fourier transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Interference","Fourier transforms","Filters","Bit error rate","Demodulation","Frequency domain analysis","Signal processing","Performance analysis","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","interference suppression","phase shift keying","signal detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","PSK","interference rejection","real-time Fourier transforms","binary phase shift-keyed","pseudonoise","demodulator","narrowband interference","transform domain filtering","spread-spectrum","windowing","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","displayDocTitle":"Narrow-band interference rejection using real-time Fourier transforms","volume":"37","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3477128","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrow-band interference rejection using real-time Fourier transforms","sourcePdf":"00031163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03581S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","articleId":"31163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":31164,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The communications channel is modeled as containing non-Gaussian background noise and, in some cases, multiple-access interference as well. The error-probability behavior is studied asymptotically as the lengths of the spreading codes increase without bound, and conditions on the spreading sequences are obtained that assure asymptotic achievement of single-user performance in a multiuser system. A long-spreading sequence approximation to the average error probability is also derived, and this result is applied to the analysis of smooth-limiting correlation receivers in impulsive channels. Simulation results are also provided to verify the analysis. Average bit-error probabilities are computed by Monte Carlo simulations for linear, hard-limiting, and smooth-limiting correlation receivers in both single- and two-user impulsive channels.

Optimization is carried out over the class of coordinate convex policies. For the case of K=2, it is shown for a wide range of parameters that the optimal control is of the threshold type. In the case of Poisson arrivals and of knapsack and object volumes being integer multiples of each other, it is shown that the optimal policy is always of the double-threshold type. An O(F) algorithm to determine the revenue of threshold policies is also given. For the general case of K classes, the problem of the optimal static control where for each class a portion of the knapsack is dedicated is considered. An efficient finite-stage dynamic programming algorithm for locating the optimal static control is presented.

First, the optimal receiver is derived for digitally phase-modulated signals when transmitted over a frequency-nonselective fading channel with memory. The memory results from the fact that usually the coherence time of the channel is larger than the symbol period. Symbols adjacent in time cannot be detected independently and therefore the well-known quadratic receiver is not optimal in this case. A maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector is derived and explicitly utilizes the channel memory for carrier recovery. The derivation shows that the optimal carrier recovery is, under certain conditions, a Kalman filter. Some attractive properties of this carrier recovery unit (including the absence of hang up) are discussed. Then the error rate of several digital modulation schemes is calculated taking the performance of the filter into account. The differences in susceptibility of the modulation schemes to carrier phase jitter are specified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.31167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1343/00031167.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.31167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1343","startPage":"748","endPage":"754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A systematic approach to carrier recovery and detection of digitally phase modulated signals of fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A systematic approach to carrier recovery and detection of digitally phase modulated signals of fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31167/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3477132","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systematic approach to carrier recovery and detection of digitally phase modulated signals of fading channels","sourcePdf":"00031167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036666S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"97","articleId":"31167","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":31168,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

The onset of degradation is a function of the signal-to-noise ratio and of the order of diversity. Specific probabilities of error are calculated for differential phase-shift keyed modulation (DPSK).

Special emphasis is placed on an all-digital implementation where carrier and clock synchronization do not require a feedback of signals to the analog part, which simplifies the analog front-end design (mixing oscillator and A/D converter sampling clock run at fixed frequency). An important advantage of the proposed algorithms is that a high clock rate is not required; only two-four times the symbol rate is needed, depending on amplitude quantization. Implementation aspects, e.g. architecture, and quantization, are considered. A prototype is described which was implemented to prove the feasibility of the concept and to evaluate the performance under practical conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An all digital receiver architecture for bandwidth efficient transmission at high data rates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.31179","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1344/00031179.pdf","startPage":"804","endPage":"813","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00031179.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.31179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1344","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"An all digital receiver architecture for bandwidth efficient transmission at high data rates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3477141","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An all digital receiver architecture for bandwidth efficient transmission at high data rates","sourcePdf":"00031179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034296S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"56","articleId":"31179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":31180,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The topology is a fully connected network with identical message generation processes at all radios. Packet lengths are exponentially distributed, and packets are generated from a Poisson process, resulting in a Markovian model. This network model accounts for the availability of idle receivers in a finite population network. The model also allows the performance of the radio channel to be specified in detail. The channel considered is a BPSK (binary phase-shift keying) direct-sequence SSMA radio channel with hard-decision Viterbi decoding. An analysis of the Viterbi decoder leads to a bound on its performance which is valid for a system with a varying probability of error, as is the case for the network under consideration. The approximate analysis yields lower bounds on throughput and probability of successful packet transmission. Results are given which show the effects on throughput of the received energy-to-noise density ratio, the number of chips per symbol, and the number of radios, as well as the improvement due to error control coding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.31180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1344/00031180.pdf","startPage":"814","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.31180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput performance of an unslotted direct-sequence SSMA packet radio network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31180/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput performance of an unslotted direct-sequence SSMA packet radio network","volume":"37","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3477142","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput performance of an unslotted direct-sequence SSMA packet radio network","sourcePdf":"00031180.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043537S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","articleId":"31180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":31181,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

A class of signature sequences called optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) that provide the auto- and cross-correlation properties required for FO-CDMA is introduced and used in an experiment to show the principles of FO-CDMA. The experiment demonstrates the auto- and cross-correlation properties of the codes. The concept of optical disk patterns, an equivalent way of representing the OOCs, is introduced.

The results are used to derive the bit error rate of the proposed FO-CDMA system as a function of data rate, code length, code weight, number of users, and receiver threshold. The performance characteristics for a variety of system parameters are discussed. A means of reducing the effective multiple-access interference signal by placing an optical hard-limiter at the front end of the desired optical correlator is presented.

By decoupling the predictor and quantizer effect it is proved that, owing to a self-stabilization phenomenon, narrowband inputs cause local instabilities in the predictor of the jointly adaptive autoregressive moving-average-prediction/quantization used in the ADPCM 32-kb/s algorithm. Despite the assured global stability, these local instabilities are not synchronized at the encoder and its preceding decoder, and a mistracking occurs which creates quantizing noise accumulation. The tracking is then shown to be very sensitive to predictor/quantizer interaction. The discontinuities introduced in the standardized adaptive quantizer extend the mistracking problem to wideband inputs. A smoothed quantizer with reduced inauspicious interaction is proposed to remedy the problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1344/00031183.pdf","startPage":"843","endPage":"850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mistracking in successive PCM/ADPCM transcoders","doi":"10.1109/26.31183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.31183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Mistracking in successive PCM/ADPCM transcoders","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3477145","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mistracking in successive PCM/ADPCM transcoders","sourcePdf":"00031183.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031141S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","articleId":"31183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":31184,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The technique is of interest because it yields arbitrarily right bounds, involves a small amount of computation, avoids numerical integrations, and applies to many types of detection. As an illustration, the technique is applied to binary DS/SSMA communications, an additive white Gaussian noise channel, and a coherent correlation receiver. It is assumed that all the signature sequences are deterministic. Each transmitter is assumed to have the same power, although the approach can accommodate the case of transmitters with unequal powers. Expressions are given for the density functions of the random variables that model the multiple-access interference.

Two topologies for realizing zero switching losses in high-power converters are proposed. The actively clamped resonant DC link inverter uses the concept of a lossless active clamp to restrict voltage stresses to only 1.3-1.5 supply voltage. For applications demanding substantially better spectral performance, the resonant pole inverter (RPI), also called the quasi-resonant current mode inverter, is proposed as a viable topology. Using only six devices rated at supply voltage, this circuit transfers the resonant components to the AC side of each phase and thus requires additional inductor and capacitor (LC) components. On the other hand, the RPI is capable of true pulsewidth modulation (PWM) operation at high frequency as opposed to discrete pulse modulation operation found in resonant DC link invertors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3500156","displayDocTitle":"Zero-switching-loss inverters for high-power applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-switching-loss inverters for high-power applications","sourcePdf":"00031240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019152S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1989","isNumber":"1347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"398","articleId":"31240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":31241,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

Of particular concern are the questions of: (i) system stability; (ii) the capability of the modular units to share voltage (series connection) and current (parallel connection) under steady-state and transient operation; and (iii) sensitivity of performance characteristics to component tolerances. Experiments were made on 1 kW bipolar transistor modular units. Two configurations, having independent local control (type A) and common switching control (type B), respectively, were studied.

A strong field constriction area is produced between the cell fusion electrodes by constricting all electric fluxes to a small opening made at the center of an insulating barrier placed between the electrodes. Cells are sent, one by one, from two micropumps, each containing a suspension of one type of cells, and then dielectrophoretically trapped at the opening to form a pearl-chain pair. Then the pulse voltage is applied to trigger the fusion of the cell pair. This procedure ensures that the fusion product is an exclusive one-to-one hybrid among the two species. Problems associated with the adhesion of the fusion product on the electrodes do not arise. The small dimensions of the field constriction area allow the application of constant pulse voltage on the cell membranes, regardless of the cell diameter. The FIC cell fusion device has been constructed and its performance tested.

Independent of the total number of sources present in the scene, the variance of the conventional MUSIC estimator along the true arrival angles is shown to be zero within a first-order approximation.

Consistency of the two criteria is proved and their performance is demonstrated by computer simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.31267","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1348/00031267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.31267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1196","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection of the number of coherent signals by the MDL principle","volume":"37","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3477337","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of the number of coherent signals by the MDL principle","sourcePdf":"00031267.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030556S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"343","articleId":"31267","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":31268,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Word preselection is achieved by segmenting and classifying the input signal in terms of broad phonetic classes. A lattice of phonetic segments is generated and organized as a graph. Word hypothesization is obtained by matching this graph against the models of all vocabulary words, where a word model is itself a phonetic representation made in terms of a graph. A modified dynamic programming matching procedure gives an efficient solution to this graph-to-graph matching problem. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) of subword units are used as a more detailed knowledge in the verification step. The word candidates generated by the previous step are represented as sequences of diphone-like subword units, and the Viterbi algorithm is used for evaluating their likelihood. Lexical knowledge is organized in a tree structure where the initial common subsequences of word descriptions are shared, and a beam-search strategy carries on the most promising paths only. The results show that a complexity reduction of about 73% can be achieved by using the two-pass approach with respect to the direct approach, while the recognition accuracy remains comparable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","volume":"37","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3477338","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lexical access to large vocabularies for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lexical access to large vocabularies for speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00031268.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090008S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"22","articleId":"31268","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":31269,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

Design methods for one class of real cyclic codes are detailed, along with examples. Encoding and parity manipulation methods are developed which permit straightforward and efficient mechanizations. Errors are detected immediately at the conclusion of the processing pass, allowing appropriate error control actions to be initiated. Typical responses to detected errors may be to retry the calculation, reconfigure the overall system, or enter a subsystem testing mode.

These equations also permit HOL (high-order language) specification of FFTs for programming signal processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms for defining mixed radix FFT flow graphs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/29.31290","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1349/00031290.pdf","startPage":"1349","endPage":"1358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.31290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for defining mixed radix FFT flow graphs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3489286","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for defining mixed radix FFT flow graphs","sourcePdf":"00031290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034115S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"10","articleId":"31290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":31291,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

It is shown how moving-window rank filters (R-filters) can be defined starting from rank estimates of location. These filters utilize the relative ranks of the observations in each window to produce an output value. The idea of rank Winsorization is extended to that of averaging only observations which lie within small temporal neighborhoods. This leads to a definition of the class of generalized Wilcoxon (GW) filters, which are parameterized by three parameters, namely the degrees of temporal and rank Winsorization and the degree of averaging. The GW filters can be defined to have desirable characteristics of edge preservation, detail retention, and impulse rejection, in addition to the property of Gaussian noise smoothing. Performance characteristics of these filters are considered through analysis and simulation. The filters show that all three well-known classes of robust location estimates, the L-, M-, and R-estimates, can be applied to nonlinear smoothing of signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.31291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1349","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1379","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1349/00031291.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear smoothing filters based on rank estimates of location","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear smoothing filters based on rank estimates of location","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3489287","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear smoothing filters based on rank estimates of location","sourcePdf":"00031291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08954S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"18","articleId":"31291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":31293,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The authors construct several counterexamples to this belief. They also construct linearly separable examples which have a unique minimum which fails to separate two families of vectors, and a simple example with four two-dimensional vectors in a single-layer network showing local minima with a large basin of attraction. Thus, back-propagation is guaranteed to fail in the first example, and likely to fail in the second example. It is shown that even multilayered (hidden-layer) networks can also fail in this way to classify linearly separable problems. Since the authors' examples are all linearly separable, the perceptron would correctly classify them.

Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the performance of the notch filter under a wide range of conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.31329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1351","startPage":"937","endPage":"947","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/31/1351/00031329.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive detection and enhancement of multiple sinusoids using a cascade IIR filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive detection and enhancement of multiple sinusoids using a cascade IIR filter","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3477282","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive detection and enhancement of multiple sinusoids using a cascade IIR filter","sourcePdf":"00031329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027489S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"202","articleId":"31329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":31331,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

The method uses a modal scattering parameter formulation and is applicable to the case of lossy lines and nonlinear terminations. The advantage of this method over other techniques resides in the computational stability, in its flexibility in the choice of a reference system, and in the simplicity of the solutions in the case where losses are neglected. An analysis of different types of coupled-line problems is presented, and the scattering parameter approach is developed to lead to the solutions for various special cases.

Each arc of a digital search tree, called a DS-tree, can be computed from the double array in 0(1) time; that is to say, the worst-case time complexity for retrieving a key becomes 0(k) for the length k of that key. The double array is modified to make the size compact while maintaining fast access, and algorithms for retrieval, insertion, and deletion are presented. If the size of the double array is n+cm, where n is the number of nodes of the DS-tree, m is the number of input symbols, and c is a constant particular to each double array, then it is theoretically proved that the worst-case times of deletion and insertion are proportional to cm and cm/sup 2/, respectively, and are independent of n. Experimental results of building the double array incrementally for various sets of keys show that c has an extremely small value, ranging from 0.17 to 1.13.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.31365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/1353/00031365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.31365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1353","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient digital search algorithm by using a double-array structure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient digital search algorithm by using a double-array structure","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31365/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3489315","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient digital search algorithm by using a double-array structure","sourcePdf":"00031365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073493S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"95","articleId":"31365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":31443,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The algorithm, which aims at obtaining the maximum a posteriori (MAP) segmentation is a simulated annealing algorithm that is interrupted at regular intervals for estimating the GRF parameters. Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters based on the current segmentation are used to obtain the next segmentation. It is proven that the parameter estimates and the segmentations converge in distribution to the ML estimate of the parameters and the MAP segmentation with those parameter estimates, respectively. Due to computational difficulties, however, only an approximate version of the algorithm is implemented. The approximate algorithm is applied on several two- and four-region images with different noise levels and with first-order and second-order neighborhoods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00031443.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1358/00031443.pdf","startPage":"799","endPage":"813","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.31443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.31443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous parameter estimation and segmentation of Gibbs random fields using simulated annealing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Simulated annealing","Image segmentation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Gaussian noise","Noise level","Partitioning algorithms","Markov random fields","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","parameter estimation","pattern recognition","picture processing","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimates","picture processing","pattern recognition","optimisation","parameter estimation","Gibbs random fields","simulated annealing","adaptive segmentation","Gaussian noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous parameter estimation and segmentation of Gibbs random fields using simulated annealing","volume":"11","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3477403","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous parameter estimation and segmentation of Gibbs random fields using simulated annealing","sourcePdf":"00031443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061914S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"274","articleId":"31443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":31447,"authors":[{"name":"C.-H.

The procedure requires no input parameter and remains reliable even when features of multiple sizes are present on the digital curve. The procedure first determines the region of support for each point based on its local properties, then computes measures of relative significance (e.g. curvature) of each point, and finally detects dominant points by a process of nonmaximum suppression. This procedure leads to the observation that the performance of dominant points detection depends not only on the accuracy of the measure of significance, but also on the precise determination of the region of support. This solves the fundamental problem of scale factor selection encountered in various dominant point detection algorithms. The inherent nature of scale-space filtering in the procedure is addressed, and the performance of the procedure is compared to those of several other dominant point detection algorithms, using a number of examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the detection of dominant points on digital curves","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.31447","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/1358/00031447.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.31447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1358","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31447/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"On the detection of dominant points on digital curves","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3477406","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the detection of dominant points on digital curves","sourcePdf":"00031447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042194S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"497","articleId":"31447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":31448,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This was reinforced when punctured versions of this code became the standard for rate 3/4 and 7/8 codes for moderately bandlimited channels. Methods are described for using the same K=7, rate 1/2 convolutional code with signal phase constellations of 8-PSK and 160PSK and quadrature amplitude constellations of 16-QASK, 64-QASK, and 256-QASK to achieve, respectively, 2 and 3, and 2, 4, and 6 b/s/Hz bandwidth efficiencies while providing power efficiency that in most cases is virtually equivalent to that of the best Ungerboeck codes for constraint length 7 or 64 states. This pragmatic approach to all coding applications permits the use of a single basic coder and decoder to achieve respectable coding (power) gains for bandwidth efficiencies from 1 b/s/Hz to 6 b/s/Hz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/35.31452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.31452","startPage":"11","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/1359/00031452.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pragmatic approach to trellis-coded modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1989","displayDocTitle":"A pragmatic approach to trellis-coded modulation","volume":"27","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3477415","publicationDate":"July 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pragmatic approach to trellis-coded modulation","sourcePdf":"00031452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03745S","chronDate":"July  1989","isNumber":"1359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"203","articleId":"31452","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":31453,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The integer unit provides high performance for Unix and other operating systems, the floating-point unit provides high throughput for computationally intensive applications and the processor includes 3D graphics hardware. The sustained high computation rates are supported by on-chip caches. The processor is supported by compilers and other development tools. The i860 processor will enable cost-effective interactive scientific visualization. This includes not only the numeric computation and 3D matrix transforms but also the pixel-intensive shading calculations that normally are either very costly or very slow.

The observer operates in the rotor frame and estimates direct and quadrature stator currents, rotor velocity, and rotor position. Since the rotor position is estimated, the rotor reference frame is approximated using the latest rotor position estimate. The motor dynamics and the transformation into the estimated rotor frame are nonlinear, and thus the observer and observer error dynamics are nonlinear. Therefore, stability is analyzed using a linearized error model. Simulations including realistic measurement disturbances are used to investigate the global stability and accuracy of the observer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/1363/00031500.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.31500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.31500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1363","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A state observer for the permanent-magnet synchronous motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronous motors","Rotors","Observers","State estimation","Actuators","Electric motors","Data mining","Motion estimation","Voltage measurement","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","rotors","stability","state estimation","synchronous motors","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current measurement","electrical states","direct stator currents","state observer","permanent-magnet synchronous motor","identity state observer","mechanical states","voltage measurements","rotor frame","quadrature stator currents","rotor velocity","rotor position","observer error dynamics","stability","linearized error model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"A state observer for the permanent-magnet synchronous motor","volume":"36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3474453","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A state observer for the permanent-magnet synchronous motor","sourcePdf":"00031500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03851S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"185","articleId":"31500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":31506,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

By applying a capacitive impedance inverter, lossless operation of the class-E inverter can be obtained for a wide range of converter load resistance, from full load to infinity. Experimental results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical calculations.

The approach can be extended to the harmonic analysis of a thyristor rectifier as well as a rectifier with unbalanced line conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.31507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/1363/00031507.pdf","endPage":"440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for calculating harmonic currents of a three-phase bridge uncontrolled rectifier with DC filter","doi":"10.1109/41.31507","startPage":"434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"A method for calculating harmonic currents of a three-phase bridge uncontrolled rectifier with DC filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31507/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3474455","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for calculating harmonic currents of a three-phase bridge uncontrolled rectifier with DC filter","sourcePdf":"00031507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027066S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"77","articleId":"31507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":31517,"authors":[{"name":"G.-W.

An initial version of the force-directed scheduling algorithm at the heart of this methodology was originally presented by the authors in 1987. The latest implementation of the logarithm introduced here reduces the number of functional units, storage units, and buses required by balancing the concurrency of operations assigned to them. The algorithm supports a comprehensive set of constraint types and scheduling modes. These include multicycle and chained operations; mutually exclusive operations; scheduling under fixed global timing constraints with minimization of functional unit costs, minimization of register costs, and minimization of global interconnect requirements; scheduling with local time constraints (on operation pairs); scheduling under fixed hardware resource constraints; functional pipelining; and structural pipeline (use of pipeline functional units). Examples from current literature, one of which was chosen as a benchmark for the 1988 High-Level Synthesis Workshop, are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.31522","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00031522.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1364/00031522.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.31522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Force-directed scheduling for the behavioral synthesis of ASICs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Force-directed scheduling for the behavioral synthesis of ASICs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3454074","volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force-directed scheduling for the behavioral synthesis of ASICs","sourcePdf":"00031522.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045069S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"732","articleId":"31522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":31523,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A prototype design environment, BLADES, which uses a divide and conquer solution strategy, has been successfully implemented and is currently capable of designing a wide range of subcircuit functional blocks as well as a limited class of integrated bipolar operational amplifiers. BLADES is believed to be the first successful design expert system in the analog design domain. It uses different levels of abstraction depending on the complexity of the design task under consideration. The importance of the abstraction level lies in the fact that once design primitives are defined, the problem of extracting the knowledge (design rules) become less complex. Two design examples are given to demonstrate the viability and versatility of the knowledge-based design technique as an analog design tool.

The cellular automata-logic-block-observation circuits presented are expected to improve upon conventional design for testability circuitry such as built-in logic-block operation as a direct consequence of reduced cross correlation between the bit streams that are used as inputs to the logic unit under test. Certain types of circuit faults are undetectable using the correlated bit streams produced by a conventional linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR). It is also noted that CA implementations exhibit data compression properties similar to those of the LFSR and that they display locality and topological regularity, which are important attributes for a very large-scale integration implementation. It is noted that some CAs may be able to generate weighted pseudorandom test patterns. It is also possible that some of the analysis of pseudorandom testing may be more directly applicable to CA-based pseudorandom testing than to LFSR-based schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.31545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1366/00031545.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.31545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cellular automata-based pseudorandom number generators for built-in self-test","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Cellular automata-based pseudorandom number generators for built-in self-test","volume":"8","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3474248","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular automata-based pseudorandom number generators for built-in self-test","sourcePdf":"00031545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060601S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"252","articleId":"31545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":31546,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The approach consists of: the determination of an optimal gate sequence and an assignment of nets to rows such that the nets are realizable. The gate sequence algorithm is based on T. Asano's approximate search (1981). Modifications are made to it to take into account constraints of transistor sizing, serial subcircuit conflicts, input/output (I/O) gates, and I/O nets. The zone-net assignment algorithm assigns nets to a minimum number of rows determined by the gate sequence and provides a means to resolve vertical conflicts in the layout. Power connections are implemented using the power nets and possible added power rows. Results of examples show that the approach can achieve a considerable improvement compared to earlier algorithms, while satisfying additional constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/1366/00031547.pdf","startPage":"875","endPage":"889","doi":"10.1109/43.31547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.31547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved gate matrix layout","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31547/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Improved gate matrix layout","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3474250","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved gate matrix layout","sourcePdf":"00031547.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029546S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"24","articleId":"31547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":31548,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It also lets programs written in any sequential language be incorporated into parallel programs targeted for any parallel architecture. Broad expressive power was obtained in CODE by including abstractions of all the dependency types that occur in the widely used parallel-computation models and by keeping the form used to specify firing rules general. The CODE programming language is a version of generalized dependency graphs designed to encode the unified parallel-computation model. A simple example is used to illustrate the abstraction level in specifying dependencies and how they are separated from the computation-unit specification. The most important CODE concepts are described by developing a declarative, hierarchical program with complex firing rules and multiple dependency types.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1989","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3488540","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"CODE: a unified approach to parallel programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CODE: a unified approach to parallel programming","sourcePdf":"00031648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028123S","chronDate":"July  1989","isNumber":"1374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"63","articleId":"31648","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":31683,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

Trapped holes in the oxide near the drain junction are found to be responsible for this degradation. Hole trapping in the oxide also causes another problem known as gate disturb, which is the undesired increase in the threshold voltage of an erased cell during programming of the other cells on the same word line. Threshold-voltage shifts due to gate disturb are used to monitor the amount of trapped holes in the oxide after cell erasure. It is determined that the trapped holes are mainly externally injected from the junction depletion region rather than directly generated in the oxide by the Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1989","accessionNumber":"3394077","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Degradations due to hole trapping in flash memory cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradations due to hole trapping in flash memory cells","sourcePdf":"00031687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030869S","chronDate":"March  1989","isNumber":"1376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"63","articleId":"31687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":31702,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

An ultrahigh-vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV/CVD) 550 degrees C epitaxy process was used. The impurity profiles are found to be much more uniform than possible with other techniques so that intrinsic base sheet resistance and base width are largely decoupled. This allows fabrication of narrow-base bipolar devices with little temperature dependence of the I-V characteristics for operation below room temperature. The better control over thickness, combined with high doping levels, improves the flexibility in device design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Epitaxial-base transistors with ultrahigh vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV/CVD) epitaxy: enhanced profile control for greater flexibility in device design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","doi":"10.1109/55.31702","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/1377/00031702.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.31702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1377","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=31702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1989","displayDocTitle":"Epitaxial-base transistors with ultrahigh vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV/CVD) epitaxy: enhanced profile control for greater flexibility in device design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1989","accessionNumber":"3394090","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Epitaxial-base transistors with ultrahigh vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV/CVD) epitaxy: enhanced profile control for greater flexibility in device design","sourcePdf":"00031702.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041528S","chronDate":"April  1989","isNumber":"1377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"36","articleId":"31702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":31717,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

An insertion loss of less than 2 dB and a rejection level of more than 20 dB are achieved for the final stage filter, and less than 5 dB and more than 50 dB, respectively, are achieved for the prefilter. Two integrated SAW modules, an antenna duplexer and a high-power amplifier, that include the above SAW filters and satisfy almost all requirements for wideband cellular radio have been developed. Their physical dimensions are the same as those of previously developed 20-MHz models. New SAW electrode materials (Al+Ni, Al+Cu+Ni) have also been investigated to improve the power-handling characteristics of the transmitter final stage filter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/31797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","volume":"36","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"3479149","pubMedId":"18290230","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SAW integrated modules for 800-MHz cellular radio portable telephones with new frequency allocations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAW integrated modules for 800-MHz cellular radio portable telephones with new frequency allocations","sourcePdf":"00031797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099414S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"21","articleId":"31797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":31798,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

These modules define the performance limits for digital finite impulse response (FIR) filters. The Gate Forest semicustom environment is a sea-of-gates-type transistor array. It supports the implementation of dynamic (domino) CMOS logic circuits. The circuit-design technique is applicable to compact high-speed designs. The realized dynamic adder architecture consists of a 2-b group adder and a Manchester carry chain (MCC). For an N-b addition this results in a N/2-b carry lookahead path. This dynamic adder scheme can be expanded into 4-b group adder modules. The multiplier module is a combination of a modified Booth-coded static adder array with a final dynamic MCC adder. The multiplier is clocked with a single (symmetric) clock signal. The clock signal is divided into a precharge pulse, in which the static part of the multiplier added array is evaluated, and an evaluation phase for the generation of the multiplication result (least significant bits). A 16-b*16-b multiplier based on this architecture runs with a 40-MHz system clock.

Also, bipolar-transistor-oriented memory circuits, such as a static BiCMOS word driver, improve delay time at high temperatures. Furthermore, the BiCMOS driver proves to have better temperature characteristics than the CMOS driver. Finally, a 1-Mb BiCMOS DRAM using the proposed technique was found to have better temperature characteristics than the 1-Mb CMOS DRAM which uses similar techniques, as was expected. Thus, BiCMOS DRAMs have improved access time at high temperatures compared with CMOS DRAMs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.32013","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1390/00032013.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.32013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1-Mbit BiCMOS DRAM using temperature-compensation circuit techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"A 1-Mbit BiCMOS DRAM using temperature-compensation circuit techniques","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3476707","volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1-Mbit BiCMOS DRAM using temperature-compensation circuit techniques","sourcePdf":"00032013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033796S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"24","articleId":"32013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":32014,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The circuit was realized with a bipolar cell-based semicustom array. Measurements have shown that a -3-dB bandwidth below 5 Hz can be realized with a capacitor value of 50 pF. The resulting offset voltage at the audio-amplifier output was 2.5 mV. The offset cancelling circuit increases the wideband noise voltage at the audio-amplifier output by 0.15-MV RMS over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 30 kHz. The use of the offset cancelling circuit eliminates the need for a large external electrolytic capacitor.

The device basically uses an interline scheme with a vertical overflow drain. To maintain 74.25-MHz ultrahigh-data-rate operation, the device adopts a dual-channel configuration for the horizontal CCD (H-CCD) register. To accomplish both vertical signal charge transfer in the vertical CCD (V-CCD) register and signal charge distribution from the V-CCD registers into the dual-channel horizontal CCD registers simultaneously within a 3.77- mu s short horizontal blanking period, a one-horizontal-period signal storage memory electrode and optical black memory are introduced. Bipolar buffer transistor chips are hybridized in the same package as the device, so as to reduce parasitic capacitance at CCD output terminals and maintain a wide-bandwidth operation. The device operates successfully and 1000-TV-line limiting resolution was obtained for both vertical and horizontal directions. Total random noise was evaluated to be 41 electrons. Dynamic range reached 66 dB. Signal-to-noise ratio for a black/white (B/W) camera was 51.5 dB under F4.0 and 2000-lux illumination conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1920(H)*1035(V) pixel high-definition CCD image sensor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.32030","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1390/00032030.pdf","startPage":"711","endPage":"717","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00032030.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.32030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"A 1920(H)*1035(V) pixel high-definition CCD image sensor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3476723","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1920(H)*1035(V) pixel high-definition CCD image sensor","sourcePdf":"00032030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065798S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"14","articleId":"32030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":32031,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Using an external 5-V power supply, the RAM achieved a 100-MHz serial access cycle, and RAS access time is 70 ns. The typical active current is 120 mA at a 190-ns cycle time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1390/00032038.pdf","doi":"10.1109/4.32038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.32038","startPage":"763","endPage":"770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental 16-Mbit CMOS DRAM chip with a 100-MHz serial read/write mode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32038/","displayDocTitle":"An experimental 16-Mbit CMOS DRAM chip with a 100-MHz serial read/write mode","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"3476731","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental 16-Mbit CMOS DRAM chip with a 100-MHz serial read/write mode","sourcePdf":"00032038.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058315S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"3","articleId":"32038","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":32039,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Two key results are obtained. One is that a BiCMOS driver achieves a 23% lower delay time and 28% lower power dissipation compared with a CMOS driver. This is due to the inherently small input gate capacitance of the BiCMOS inverter and the small number of inverter stages required to make the BiCMOS driver. The other result is that a 1-Mb BiCMOS DRAM incorporating the BiCMOS driver provides higher performance in terms of a 36% faster access time and 24% lower power dissipation after fabrication process deviations and temperature changes. The resistance to the process deviations and temperature changes of the BiCMOS is responsible for such excellent performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Random access memory","CMOS technology","Power dissipation","Driver circuits","Inverters","Temperature","CMOS logic circuits","Delay effects","Capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BIMOS integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated memory circuits","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS","BiCMOS","DRAM performance","access time","power dissipation","TTL","delay time","power dissipation","input gate capacitance","inverter stages","fabrication process deviations","temperature changes","1 Mbit","1.3 micron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32039","doi":"10.1109/4.32039","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1390/00032039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.32039","startPage":"771","endPage":"778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of CMOS and BiCMOS 1-Mbit DRAM performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of CMOS and BiCMOS 1-Mbit DRAM performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3476732","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of CMOS and BiCMOS 1-Mbit DRAM performance","sourcePdf":"00032039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033446S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"15","articleId":"32039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":32042,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

From a global modeling of this problem, both data association (DA) and maneuver estimation problems can be simultaneously solved using system identification techniques. With this approach, previously developed single-target tracking/acceleration estimation techniques can be directly used for the MTT problem. Both DA and MDE (maneuver detection and estimation) are viewed as simultaneous problems where possible interactions among the targets can be taken into consideration. The global modeling translates this problem to a system identification problem for systems with time-varying parameters where the parameters can take only a finite number of values at each time. This becomes an adaptive (multiple model) Kalman filtering (MMKF) problem whose solution can be computed. The computational load associated with the full solution of MMKF can then be reduced utilizing many types of approximate (suboptimal) solutions developed in the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.32084","startPage":"520","endPage":"528","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/1392/00032084.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.32084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unifying approach to multitarget tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Mathematical model","System identification","Model driven engineering","Kalman filters","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Maximum a posteriori estimation","Acceleration","Time varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","Kalman filters","optimal systems","parameter estimation","signal detection","time-varying systems","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Kalman filtering","suboptimal solution","approximation","multitarget tracking","data association","system identification","maneuver detection and estimation","global modeling","time-varying parameters","multiple model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","displayDocTitle":"A unifying approach to multitarget tracking","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3488997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unifying approach to multitarget tracking","sourcePdf":"00032084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032609S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"12","articleId":"32084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":32087,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

The associated error probabilities are also evaluated following a procedure that utilizes optimized Chernoff-like bounds for a tight approximation. A methodology is demonstrated for appropriately setting the decision threshold for this example as a tradeoff against allowable observation time.

Any two electrodes can be configured as a bipolar pair to conduct a symmetrical, biphasic, constant-current pulsatile stimulus. Up to three stimuli can be presented in rapid succession or effectively simultaneously. For simultaneous stimulation, a novel time-division current multiplexing technique has been developed to obviate electrode interactions that may compromise safety. The stimuli are independently controllable in current amplitude, duration, and onset time. Groups of three stimuli can be generated at a rate of typically 500 Hz. Stimulus control data and power are conveyed to the implant through a single transcutaneous inductive link. The device incorporates a telemetry system that enables electrode voltage waveforms to be monitored externally in real time. The electronics of the implant are contained almost entirely on a custom designed integrated circuit.

An important link between empirically based investigations of neural network classification models and the correct application of these models to AI-based systems is established. General expressions are derived relating the performance of the Hopfield model to the number and dimensionality of code vectors stored in memory. The average performance of the network is analyzed by randomizing the subsequent code vectors and examining classification relative to the output bit errors. An exact probabilistic description of the network is derived for the first iteration, and an approximate second-moment analysis generalizable to multiple iterations examines performance near a fixed point. Degradations generated by noisy or incomplete input data are analyzed. The results show that the Hopfield net has major limitations when applied to fixed pattern classification problems because of its sensitivity to the number of code vectors stored in memory and the signal-to-noise ratio of the input data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3465968","volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Classification performance of a Hopfield neural network based on a Hebbian-like learning rule","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification performance of a Hopfield neural network based on a Hebbian-like learning rule","sourcePdf":"00032122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033022S","chronDate":"Mar 1989","isNumber":"1394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"10","articleId":"32122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":32124,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

A concentration on the first of these and a detailed analysis of variable-rate tree-structured vector quantization are provided. It is found that variable-rate tree-structured vector quantization outperforms not only the fixed-rate variety but also full-search vector quantization. The successive approximation character of variable-rate tree-structured vector quantization permits it to degrade gracefully if the rate is reduced at the encoder.

There is a gradual loss of accuracy with increasing parameter values. For example, for N=10/sup 9/, and with both NX and Y near 10/sup 7/, the accuracy can drop to ten places.

It is shown that if the transmitters are assigned the same waveform, symbol asynchronism has no effect on the two-user capacity region of the white Gaussian channel which is equal to the Cover-Syner pentagon, whereas if the assigned waveforms are different (e.g., code division multiple access), the symbol-asynchronous capacity region is no longer a pentagon.

First, sufficient conditions are provided that enable relatively simple decoding rules such as typicality, maximum mutual information, and minimum distance, to attain capacity. Then the (possibly noisy) OR channels and group adder channels are studied in detail. For the former the capacity is explicitly determined and shown to be attainable by minimum-distance decoding. Next, for a large class of addictive AVCs, in addition to providing an intuitively suggestive simplification of the general AVC capacity formula, it is proven that capacity can be attained by a universal decoding rule. Finally, the effect of random state selections on capacity is studied. The merits and limitations of a previous mutual information game approach are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.32153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1395/00032153.pdf","startPage":"752","endPage":"769","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00032153.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.32153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and decoding rules for classes of arbitrarily varying channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32153/","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and decoding rules for classes of arbitrarily varying channels","volume":"35","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3488929","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and decoding rules for classes of arbitrarily varying channels","sourcePdf":"00032153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053916S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"28","articleId":"32153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":32154,"authors":[{"name":"M.V.

The objective function considered is the rate of reliable communication. The communicator's strategies are encoders and distributions on a set of quantizers. The jammer's strategies are distributions on the noise power subject to certain constraints. Various conditions are considered on the jammer's strategy set and on the communicator's knowledge. For the case where the decoder is uninformed of the actual quantizer chosen, it is shown that, from the communicator's perspective, the worst-case jamming strategy is a distribution concentrated on a finite number of points, thereby converting a functional optimization problem into a nonlinear programming problem. Moreover, the worst-case distributions can be characterized by means of necessary and sufficient conditions which are easy to verify. For the case where the decoder is informed of the actual quantizer chosen, the existence of saddle-point strategies is demonstrated. The analysis is also seen to be valid for a number of situations where the jammer is adaptive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3488930","volume":"35","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity of channels with unknown interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity of channels with unknown interference","sourcePdf":"00032154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047454S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"16","articleId":"32154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":32155,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Equations are derived describing the output and the quantization noise of MSM for an arbitrary input signal, and the noise-shaping characteristic of MSM is investigated. The spectral characteristics of an m-stage sigma-delta modulator with both DC and sinusoidal inputs are developed. For both types of inputs the binary quantizer noise of the mth (m>or=3) quantizer, which appears at the output as an mth order difference, is asymptotically white, uniformly distributed, and uncorrelated with the input level. It is also found that for an m-stage sigma-delta quantizer with either an ideal low-pass filter or a sinc/sup m+1/ filter decoder, the average quantization noise of the system is inversely proportional to the (2m+1)th power of the oversampling ratio. This implies that the high-order systems are favourable in terms of the trade-off between the quantization noise and oversampling ratio. Simulation results are presented to support the theoretical analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.32155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/1395/00032155.pdf","startPage":"784","endPage":"796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.32155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistage sigma-delta modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32155/","displayDocTitle":"Multistage sigma-delta modulation","volume":"35","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3476807","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistage sigma-delta modulation","sourcePdf":"00032155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030616S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"96","articleId":"32155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":32156,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

In this process the MESFET's output is conjugate-matched and its input is mismatched to obtain a specified gain. This method generally results in a better dynamic range than obtained with other options such as matching the input and mismatching the output or simultaneously matching both the input and output (which, in many cases, is impossible). In available-gain design the value of source impedance that provides the desired gain is not unique and can be selected to optimize IM levels. A numerical formulation of the Volterra series allows a complete equivalent circuit of the FET to be used, and the intermodulation calculations include all feedback effects. The sensitivity of the IM intercept point (IP/sub 3/) to the source-reflection coefficient, Gamma /sub s/, is shown to decrease with increasing frequency and is related to the MESFET's stability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.32225","startPage":"1411","endPage":"1417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.32225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1397","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1397/00032225.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimization of intermodulation distortion in GaAs MESFET small-signal amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32225/","displayDocTitle":"Minimization of intermodulation distortion in GaAs MESFET small-signal amplifiers","volume":"37","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3476847","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimization of intermodulation distortion in GaAs MESFET small-signal amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00032225.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027329S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"42","articleId":"32225","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":32227,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Loading the input and/or the output lines of a distributed amplifier with this circuit reduces the signal losses, leading to an increase in the allowed number of active devices with a consequent increase in the gain-bandwidth and gain-maximum-frequency products. The cascode circuit, a related loss reduction network, is also evaluated because of its use in distributed amplifiers. Several designs employing the common-gate FET loss-compensating circuit and/or the cascode amplifying circuit are compared to a conventional distributed amplifier optimized for gain-bandwidth product. Simulated gain-maximum-operating frequency product increases of 27% to 245% over that of the optimized conventional distributed amplifier are shown. The increase in single-stage amplifier gain provided by this technique often results in (proportionally) higher maximum output power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attenuation compensation in distributed amplifier design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.32227","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/1397/00032227.pdf","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.32227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1397","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32227/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"Attenuation compensation in distributed amplifier design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3476849","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attenuation compensation in distributed amplifier design","sourcePdf":"00032227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036938S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"49","articleId":"32227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":32234,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A lumped-parameter computer simulation is developed to predict the performance of the launcher system. It is shown that a traveling electromagnetic wave can be generated on the barrel by the resonance of drive coils and their capacitors. More than half of the energy initially stored in the capacitor bank can be converted into kinetic energy of the projectile in one shot, and an additional quarter can be utilized in subsequent shots, if the launcher dimensions, resonant frequency, and firing sequence are properly selected. The projectile starts smoothly from zero initial velocity and with zero initial sleeve current. Section-to-section transitions which have significant effects on the launcher performance are also discussed.

It is found that the recovery characteristics are independent of the electrode materials (Cu, Al , St) and the arc current in the range from 40 to 200 A.

Both methods are obtained by optimization of a criterion and are iterative. The noise estimates can be used for sensor-output whitening and it then provides a means to improve array processing performance. The two methods perform well, both on simulated and real data.

Specifically, the problem is to estimate the probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed.

Chan and L.R. Rabiner (IEEE Trans. Audio Electroacoust., vol.AU-21; p.354-66, Aug. 1973) for predicting the effects of quantized coefficients in direct-form finite-impulse response (FIR) filters is presented. The analysis is used on more sophisticated quantizing procedures involving linear feedback of rounding errors. It is shown that the expected disturbance filter frequency response due to quantization can be controlled. The effect is concentrated in tolerant frequency bands and significantly reduced in critical ones. The price paid is an increase of overall expected disturbance. The method is demonstrated in a practical filter design. A low-pass filter for factor 2 decimation that has greater margins for quantization effects in the passband than in the stopband is specified.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.32280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.32280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1399","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1399/00032280.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Digital filters","Quantization","Frequency response","Computational complexity","Filtering","Linear programming","Cost function","Computational efficiency","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","filtering and prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear-phase direct-form FIR digital filters","quantized coefficients","error spectrum shaping","finite-impulse response","linear feedback","rounding errors","low-pass filter","factor 2 decimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of linear-phase direct-form FIR digital filters with quantized coefficients using error spectrum shaping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32280/","volume":"37","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"3477321","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of linear-phase direct-form FIR digital filters with quantized coefficients using error spectrum shaping","sourcePdf":"00032280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032408S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"23","articleId":"32280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":32281,"authors":[{"name":"L.C.

The aim is to optimize the parameters characterizing E(z) until the sum of the stopband energies of the analysis filters is minimized. There are four novel elements in the procedure reported here. The first is a technique for efficient initialization of one of the M analysis filters, as a spectral factor of an Mth band filter. The factorization itself is done in an efficient manner using the eigenfilters approach, without the need for root-finding techniques. The second element is the initialization of the internal parameters which characterize E(z), based on the above spectral factor. The third element is a modified characterization, mostly free from rotation angles, of the FIR E(z). The fourth is the incorporation of symmetry among the analysis filters, so as to minimize the number of unknown parameters being optimized. The resulting design procedure always gives better filter responses than earlier ones (for a given filter length) and converges much faster.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3477323","displayDocTitle":"Improved technique for design of perfect reconstruction FIR QMF banks with lossless polyphase matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved technique for design of perfect reconstruction FIR QMF banks with lossless polyphase matrices","sourcePdf":"00032282.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077308S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"141","articleId":"32282","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":32283,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The exact expression for the MSE is complicated, but simple expressions that are asymptotic in the model order are developed for model structures of finite impulse response (FIR) character. Simulations verify that these simple expressions are quite reliable and insightful even for moderate model orders. Expressions are developed for three basic adaptation algorithms (recursive identification algorithms), viz. the least-mean-squares algorithm, the recursive least-squares algorithm with exponential forgetting, and a tracking algorithm based on the Kalman filter.

Block implementation and fine-grain pipelined block implementation of recursive digital filters are discussed. A new technique of incremental output computation is introduced which requires a linear complexity in block size. Based on the clustered look-ahead and incremental output computation approaches, incremental block-state structure is derived for block implementation of state-space filters of multiplication complexity linear in block size. The incremental block-state structure is also extended for the multirate recursive filtering case. The techniques of scattered look-ahead, clustered look-ahead, decomposition, and incremental output computation are combined to introduce several pipeline stages inside the recursive loop of the block filter. Deeply pipelined block filter structures are derived for implementation of direct-form and state-space-form recursive digital filters. The multiplication complexity of these pipelined block filters is linear with respect to the block size and logarithmic with respect to the number of loop pipeline stages, and the complexities due to pipelining and block processing are additive.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.32287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.32287","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00032287.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel1/29/1399/00032287.pdf","startPage":"1118","endPage":"1134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipeline interleaving and parallelism in recursive digital filters.

Two priority mechanisms for voice/data traffic on round-robin networks are studied: the alternating-rounds mechanism of the Expressnet, and the token rotation timer mechanism of the token bus, which restricts access rights based on the time taken for a token to make one round. It is shown that the deterministic schemes almost always perform better than the contention-based scheme. Design issues such as the choice of minimum voice packet length, priority parameters, and voice encoding rate are investigated. An important aspect that is noted is the accurate characterization of performance over a wide region of the design space of voice/data networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.32329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1402/00032329.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"669","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00032329.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.32329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative performance of voice/data local area networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32329/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative performance of voice/data local area networks","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3455134","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative performance of voice/data local area networks","sourcePdf":"00032329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036197S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"27","articleId":"32329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":32330,"authors":[{"name":"P.-C.

This ring has the following distinct features: (1) it allows synchronous traffic such as voice and video to have a definite access to the channel within each packetization period (or frame); (2) it allows data messages to have a higher channel access priority provided that the synchronous traffic is not delayed by more than one frame; (3) it supports variable rate data circuits. Simulation results show that the data-message delay is much smaller than for other integrated services schemes. Urgent messages can be transmitted with a higher priority over voice. Since the voice packet delay is bounded within one packetization period, no time-stamping is needed and the voice loss can be completely avoided by reserving a sufficient number of slots. Continual speech reception is possible by synchronizing the speech regeneration process to the end of each frame. Since the ring is synchronized, gateway switching to external circuit-switched and packet-switched networks is very simple.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.32330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1402/00032330.pdf","endPage":"679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An integrated services token-controlled ring network","doi":"10.1109/49.32330","startPage":"670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"An integrated services token-controlled ring network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32330/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3455135","publicationDate":"June 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An integrated services token-controlled ring network","sourcePdf":"00032330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073796S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","articleId":"32330","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":32334,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The most important issues relating to its transmission are identified and studied in the context of a layered network architecture model, leading to a better understanding of the interactions between network and signal handling.

In the layered network model, the higher layers provide format conversion, hierarchical source coding, error recovery, resynchronization, cost/quality arbitration, session setup and tear-down, packetization, and multiplexing. Provisions from the network layers pertain mainly to real-time transmission. Special consideration is given to hierarchical source coding, error recovery, statistical behavior, and timing aspects. Simulation results indicating practical solutions to some of the issues raised are presented for a hierarchical packet-video subband coding system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.32337","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1402/00032337.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.32337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1402","startPage":"739","endPage":"751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet video and its integration into the network architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Packet video and its integration into the network architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3455142","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet video and its integration into the network architecture","sourcePdf":"00032337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054492S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"121","articleId":"32337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":32338,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The two-layer coder produces two output bit streams: the first bit stream contains all the important structural information in the image and is accommodated in the guaranteed capacity of the network, while the second adds the necessary quality finish. The performance of the coder is tested with CIF standard sequences and broadcast-quality pictures. The portion of the VBR channel allocated to the lower layer as guaranteed bandwidth is examined. Using broadcast-quality pictures, statistics were obtained on the performance of this system for different choices of bit rate in the lower layer. The effect of lost packets is shown on CIF standard picture sequences.

Buffer reservation control in the user-network interface and a retransmission scheme based on a long-size block are used to realize high-speed congestion control and error recovery.

In this method, the receiver detects the damaged picture area caused by packet loss from the structured picture data received, makes error concealments, notifies the transmitter, and continues decoding. The transmitter, having received the notice, calculates the affected picture area in the local decoded picture and continues encoding without using this affected area. In this selective recovery method, video signals are not stopped even if a long propagation delay exists, no additional information is transmitted to error recovery and conventional coding algorithms can be used. The proposed method is suitable for multipoint communication.

The previous models and analysis were suitable for relatively uniform activity scenes. Here, models are considered for scenes with multiple activity levels which lead to sudden changes in the coder output bit rates. Such models apply to talker-listener alternating scenes, as well as to situations where there is a mix of dissimilar services, e.g., television and videotelephony. Correlated Markov models for the corresponding sources are given. A flow-equivalent queueing analysis is used to obtain common buffer queue distributions and probabilities of packet loss. The results demonstrate the efficiency of packet video on a single link, due to the smoothing effect of multiplexing several variable-bit-rate video sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.32350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/1402/00032350.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.32350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1402","startPage":"865","endPage":"869","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00032350.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Models for packet switching of variable-bit-rate video sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Models for packet switching of variable-bit-rate video sources","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3455155","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models for packet switching of variable-bit-rate video sources","sourcePdf":"00032350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033107S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"165","articleId":"32350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":32363,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

One such method involves using light with a short coherence length, so that returns from different sensors will be mutually incoherent. The interferometric signal associated with each sensor can then be recovered via appropriate optical processing. The author considers sensors multiplexed using this technique and calculates their noise performance. It is found that for systems with only a few sensors, the minimum detectable phase is limited by the noise associated with incoherent interference; this can be minimized by using light with as short a coherence length as is practical. The maximum number of sensors that can be multiplexed is limited by optical power loss. A ladder topology is tentatively found to give the best performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3455662","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical noise performance of coherence-multiplexed interferometric sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical noise performance of coherence-multiplexed interferometric sensors","sourcePdf":"00032363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052895S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"51","articleId":"32363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":32364,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.W.

This model includes the effects of channel resistance and band-to-band tunneling. The agreement between the calculations and experimental results supports the validity of the model. The authors discuss the optimum design for these JFETs and compare their performance quantitatively. In order to prevent device performance from being degraded by the effects of tunneling, the optimum channel dopings of In/sub 0.53/Ga/sub 0.47/As and InP JFETs are found to be 7*10/sup 16/ and 5*10/sup 17/ cm/sup -3/, respectively. In/sub 0.53/Ga/sub 0.47/As JFETs not operated in the tunneling regime show at least a 40% higher efficiency than InP JFETs in terms of the power dissipated per transconductance. The authors conclude that In/sub 0.53/Ga/sub 0.47/As JFETs are well suited for very-high-density monolithic integration, where power efficiency must be high.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","publicationDate":"June 1989","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3455663","volume":"7","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of In/sub 0.53/Ga/sub 0.47/As and InP junction field-effect transistors for optoelectronic integrated circuits.

The analysis accounts for the crosstalk between adjacent channels, the intersymbol interference and correlation between noise samples stemming from the limited IF bandwidth the non-Gaussian statistics of the noise at the decision gate, and the impact of the laser phase noise. It is found that the IF bandwidth needed to avoid intersymbol interference is 2.2 bit rates for a modulation index m=1; it is larger for other modulation index values. For m=1, receiver sensitivity is within 1 dB of the shot noise limit, and the electrical domain channel spacing can be as small as 2.05 bit rates with 1-dB sensitivity penalty. The foregoing conclusions are valid for a negligibly narrow linewidth; the degradation due to phase noise is shown to be modest as long as the linewidth does not exceed 1% of the bit rate if m=1. Larger linewidth can be tolerated if the modulation index is larger than unity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00032366.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/1403/00032366.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"982","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.32366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.32366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1403","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel CPFSK coherent optical communications systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Crosstalk","Phase noise","Bit rate","Modulation","Intersymbol interference","Optical noise","Bandwidth","Communication systems","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","frequency shift keying","intersymbol interference","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel continuous-phase frequency-shift-keying","CPFSK","coherent optical communications systems","crosstalk","adjacent channels","intersymbol interference","correlation","noise samples","limited IF bandwidth","decision gate","laser phase noise","modulation index","receiver sensitivity","shot noise limit","electrical domain channel spacing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel CPFSK coherent optical communications systems","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1989","accessionNumber":"3455665","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel CPFSK coherent optical communications systems","sourcePdf":"00032366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082911S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"28","articleId":"32366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":32378,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The devices show very low gate leakage current, low output conductance, a transconductance per unit gate width of 3 mS/mm, and a pinch-off voltage of -1.5 V. The integration of the devices onto the detectors makes possible the matching of the input capacitance of the JFET to the detector's output capacitance, which is of the order of few hundreds of femtorads. The measured gate capacitance of 200 fF is shown to correspond to an expected resolution in charge measurements, at room temperature, of less than 40 electrons rms. The fabrication constraints, imposed by the limited number of production steps of the detectors, are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3376447","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Implanted silicon JFET on completely depleted high-resistivity devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implanted silicon JFET on completely depleted high-resistivity devices","sourcePdf":"00032439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133206S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"1408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"95","articleId":"32439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":32456,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The first is to state systematically its main hypotheses and key conditions, justify the former, and suggest means to guarantee the latter. The identification and error analysis of critical machines are among the investigated issues. The second is to scan all possible types of instabilities likely to arise in practice and devise means to treat them. The extension of the EEAC to cases beyond the so-called first-swing stability makes it more robust than all direct methods developed up to now. The third objective is to extract essential information out of a large body of simulations and show that the above improvements and extensions enhance the EEAC accuracy and its capability to work properly even under stringent conditions.

The algorithm is applied to the case of a volt/hertz relay.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.32649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/1413/00032649.pdf","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1609","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00032649.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.32649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive sampling-interval generator for digital relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32649/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive sampling-interval generator for digital relaying","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3467413","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive sampling-interval generator for digital relaying","sourcePdf":"00032649.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032891S","chronDate":"Jul 1989","isNumber":"1413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"71","articleId":"32649","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":32658,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The distribution of surface charged is closely related to the normal component (gas side) E/sub n/ of electric field on the spacer surface. The ,maximum charge density can be estimated from the condition of E/sub n/=0. When voltage is applied in a polarity opposite to prestressed DC, surface charge increases the maximum field strength in the arrangement, resulting in the reduction of the insulating ability.

The validity and limitations of the universal relationship between the inversion-layer mobility and the effective normal field (E/sub eff/) were examined. Differences have been found in E/sub eff/ dependence between electron and hole mobility. A marked deviation from the universal curve due to substrate impurity scattering has been observed at low carrier concentration. The results suggest that by adding a term for the surface roughness scattering and the deviation due to Coulomb scattering to the universal curves, a more accurate description of inversion-layer mobilities can be realized over a wide range of substrate impurity concentration. The mobility degradation caused by carrier injection also has been studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32840/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3398639","publicationDate":"1988","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the universality of inversion-layer mobility in n- and p-channel MOSFETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the universality of inversion-layer mobility in n- and p-channel MOSFETs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00032840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054102S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1988","isNumber":"1415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"713","citationCount":"85","articleId":"32840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":32843,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Its conduction mechanism is found to be different from that caused by positive charge accumulation in that it has the opposite thickness dependence. A corresponding increase of charge loss in a write/erase (W/E)-cycled EEPROM cell is observed with decreasing oxide thickness in a room-temperature retention test. When oxide thickness is decreased, the maximum number of W/E cycles to tunnel-oxide breakdown decreases with the decrease in charge to breakdown of the negatively biased gate.

The flash cell is implemented in a staggered virtual ground-array which yields a cell size of 18 mu m with 1.2- mu m design rules in a double-poly CMOS EPROM process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["EPROM","Voltage","Charge pumps","Nonvolatile memory","CMOS process","Split gate flash memory cells","Channel hot electron injection","Costs","Secondary generated hot electron injection","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit technology","integrated memory circuits","PROM","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high density","poly-poly erase","flash EPROM cell","5-V-only","erasable programmable read-only memory","programmed by channel-hot-electron injection","poly-poly oxide","self-aligned split-gate EPROM","polysilicon erase line","charge-pumping technique","low programming current","fast programming","worst case condition","over-erase technique","uniform erase","high read current","extended endurance","flash cell","staggered virtual ground-array","cell size","design rules","double-poly CMOS EPROM process","5 V","125 C","4.5 V","18 micron","1.2 micron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32849","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1988.32849","displayPublicationTitle":"Technical Digest., International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/713/1415/00032849.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1988.32849","startPage":"436","endPage":"439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1415","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest., International Electron Devices Meeting","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5 volt high density poly-poly erase flash EPROM cell","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 5 volt high density poly-poly erase flash EPROM cell","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1988","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1988","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3380315","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 5 volt high density poly-poly erase flash EPROM cell","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00032849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033518S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1988","isNumber":"1415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"713","citationCount":"13","articleId":"32849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":32867,"authors":[{"name":"H.T.

A retrograde n-well is shown to be desirable since it offers decreased well resistance without the modification of surface device characteristics. Retention time can be further improved with an n-well doping concentration that decreases monotically with increasing depth rather than a retrograde profile which has a doping peak below the silicon surface. An n-well with such a doping profile has superior median retention time and a reduced number of bits that fail a data retention test. This improvement has been demonstrated by the fabrication of 4-Mb SPT-cell DRAM arrays and test structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1988.32882","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest., International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Technical Digest., International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/713/1415/00032882.pdf","startPage":"584","endPage":"587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1988.32882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1415","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=32882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"n-well design for trench DRAM arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/32882/","displayDocTitle":"n-well design for trench DRAM arrays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 1988","accessionNumber":"3398656","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"n-well design for trench DRAM arrays","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00032882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04295S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 1988","isNumber":"1415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"713","citationCount":"11","articleId":"32882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":32883,"authors":[{"name":"N.C.C.

The mechanism of the soft error is the high-resistive load memory cell is analyzed. It is found that the dependence of SER on the cycle time is caused by the potential drop in the high storage node, which is produced by the threshold current through the driver and access transistors in the memory cell. Improvement methods to suppress the subthreshold current are presented. One method utilizes high-threshold-voltage transistors in the memory cell. The other sets the selected word-line level lower than the supply voltage. Using these methods, the high storage node potential is kept at the supply voltage in spite of the small conductance of the load resistor. The effect is confirmed in 256 kbit CMOS SRAMs. The dependence of SER on the cycle time becomes negligible, and SER is improved by two orders of magnitude.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34063/","volume":"24","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"3508913","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of soft-error rate in MOS SRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of soft-error rate in MOS SRAMs","sourcePdf":"00034063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086981S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","articleId":"34063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":34064,"authors":[{"name":"P.H.

Ordinary inline pipelines have the problem of minimizing the average total processing time through the pipeline, since subdivision of a function along the pipeline is usually optimized for the most complex operations in spite of the fact that simpler operations need fewer stages. As a solution to this problem, a variable-length pipeline scheme in which data go through only the necessary stages according to information contained within is proposed. The scheme has been implemented on a test chip to verify performance. The chip demonstrated a minimum fall-through time (data transmission time from input to output) of 14.4 ns and a data transmission rate in the pipeline of 59 megaword/s (that is, 1/16.9 ns) as a first-in first-out (FIFO) store. By modifying the data transfer control and allocating the processing functions corresponding to the data interval of 16.9 ns, this scheme is applicable as a high-performance processing unit for data-driven processors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3508924","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"24","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of a variable-length pipeline scheme for data-driven processors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of a variable-length pipeline scheme for data-driven processors","sourcePdf":"00034074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02884S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","articleId":"34074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34078,"authors":[{"name":"N.

A 1.0 mu m design rule permits layout of an NMOS memory cell with a high-resistance polysilicon load in 54.7 mu m/sup 2/ and a 4.09*8.60 mm/sup 2/ chip. High performance is achieved by an optimized circuit design using a new input buffer, a BiCMOS decoder, and a high-speed bipolar sense amplifier. An active pull-down emitter-follower circuit and a BiCMOS current mirror ECL-MOS level shift circuit improve input buffer delay to less than 1.8 ns. A power-down technique has been studied to reduce standby power. Some experimental results are presented. High-speed address access is observed over a wide operational range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.34087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.34087","endPage":"1027","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00034087.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/1419/00034087.pdf","startPage":"1021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 8 ns 256 K BiCMOS RAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34087/","displayDocTitle":"An 8 ns 256 K BiCMOS RAM","volume":"24","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"3508931","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 8 ns 256 K BiCMOS RAM","sourcePdf":"00034087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045795S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"14","articleId":"34087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":34088,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These models have been incorporated into a special-purpose DAC analysis/simulation tool (DACSIM) to provide a powerful Monte-Carlo yield estimation capability. DACSIM also performs accurate DC simulation of a large class of resistor-network DAC circuits taking into account many important parasitic effects, including superposition nonlinearities. An error-corrected DAC architecture that uses the concept of a generalised decoding strategy programmable at test has been validated in a CMOS 13 bit segmented current-switched DAC.

The crystallographic and superconducting properties necessary for Nb-based integrated circuit processes are clarified. Tunnel barrier structures of NbN-Nb oxide-NbN (Pb alloy) and Nb-Al oxide-Nb Josephson junctions have been analyzed and correlated with junction characteristics and critical current uniformity. It was found that the surface structure of a base electrode should be smooth to ensure that Josephson junctions have low leakage current and uniform critical current distribution. New types of Josephson junctions with artificial tunnel barriers such as amorphous Si or Mg oxide are reviewed. A variety of Josephson junction structures or processes have been developed for Nb-based Josephson integrated circuits in order to improve circuit performance. These include junction miniaturization, planarization, and stacked junction structures. These structures are mainly intended for Nb-Al oxide-Nb Josephson circuits. The Nb-Al oxide-Nb Josephson junction technology is by far the most advanced and has been used in logic and memory circuits, for example a 4-bit*4-bit parallel multiplier, a Josephson logic gate array, a 16-bit arithmetic logic unit, a 4-bit microprocessor, and 1-kb and 4-kb memory circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.34117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.34117","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/1420/00034117.pdf","startPage":"1164","endPage":"1176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Niobium-based integrated circuit technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Niobium-based integrated circuit technologies","volume":"77","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3503251","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Niobium-based integrated circuit technologies","sourcePdf":"00034117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087795S","chronDate":"Aug.  1989","isNumber":"1420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"19","articleId":"34117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34119,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Recent progress in fabrication and circuit technology has improved memory performance. An AC powering scheme, instead of the earlier DC system, has been developed. The AC powering scheme eliminates complicated timing control, which restricts shortening access time, but introduces large power consumption and in-phase powering problems. A parallel decoding scheme that decreases the number of decoding stages is presented. It will decrease the decoding time and AND scheme decoder. An attractive OR-inverter scheme has been proposed for a decoder suitable for a memory with a large capacity. The chip performance strongly depends not only on whether the read mode is destructive or nondestructive but also on the cell connection method, which determines the line inductance. Because the cell input line inductance depends on layered construction of the lines, a planarizing technology for an Nb Josephson integrated circuit has been developed to reduce line inductance by thinning the insulators. Access time of less than 0.5 ns has been confirmed in 1-kb and 4-kb memories using the proposed memory architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00034119.png","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/1420/00034119.pdf","startPage":"1194","endPage":"1207","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.34119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.34119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1420","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Josephson memory technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Circuits","Memory architecture","Inductance","Niobium","Read-write memory","Fabrication","Energy consumption","Magnetic flux","Cache memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular arrays","decoding","reviews","superconducting memory circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access time","memory circuit architecture","Josephson memory technology","cell array","sense circuit","power consumption","AC powering scheme","access time","parallel decoding scheme","decoding time","AND scheme decoder","OR-inverter scheme","cell connection method","planarizing technology","Josephson integrated circuit","0.5 ns","1 kbit","4 kbit","Nb"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Josephson memory technology","volume":"77","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3511325","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Josephson memory technology","sourcePdf":"00034119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07092S","chronDate":"Aug.  1989","isNumber":"1420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"25","articleId":"34119","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":34120,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Using Nb-based thin-film technology, a number of groups can now routinely fabricate DC SQUIDS with input circuits integrated on the same chip. At 4.2 K, the DC SQUID, which operates with a constant bias current, can detect signals with an equivalent energy per unit bandwidth of a few hundred h2 pi . RF SQUIDs, which operate with an RF flux bias, are usually machined from bulk Nb, and have a typical energy sensitivity per unit bandwidth of 10/sup 5/ to 10/sup 6/h2 pi . Both types of SQUID can be used in a wide variety of applications, including magnetometers, gradiometers, susceptometers, voltmeters, RF amplifiers, gravity-wave antennas, and gravity gradiometers. Both DC and RF SQUIDs have been fabricated from high-temperature superconductors and operated at temperatures of up to 77 K. These devices exhibit high levels of 1/f noise, which generally arises from the motion of trapped magnetic flux.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.34120","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1223","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/1420/00034120.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.34120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principles and applications of SQUIDs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SQUIDs","Radio frequency","High temperature superconductors","Bandwidth","Superconducting devices","Radiofrequency interference","Superconducting thin films","Thin film circuits","Integrated circuit technology","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetometers","reviews","SQUIDs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overview","RF SQUIDs","superconducting quantum interference devices","DC SQUID","constant bias current","energy sensitivity","magnetometers","susceptometers","voltmeters","RF amplifiers","gravity-wave antennas","gravity gradiometers","high-temperature superconductors","1/f noise","trapped magnetic flux","Nb thin film technology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Principles and applications of SQUIDs","volume":"77","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3503252","publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34120/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principles and applications of SQUIDs","sourcePdf":"00034120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077766S","chronDate":"Aug.  1989","isNumber":"1420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"81","articleId":"34120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":34141,"authors":[{"name":"C.Y.

It uses the discrete Fourier transform technique to treat both the derivatives and the convolution integrals which often appear in these equations. As a consequence, this method is extremely simple to implement, uses less computer memory than comparable methods, and yields accurate predictions. The differential-integral equation is recast into a periodic form conducive to application of the discrete Fourier convolution theorem. The differential operators are approximated by appropriate finite-difference and discrete-convolution operators. All these quantities are computed by using the fast Fourier transform. An approximate solution is obtained by using the conjugate gradient method. Results are compared to experimental data or analytical solutions for a 3 lambda *3 lambda metal plate (where lambda is the wavelength), a homogeneous and a layered infinite circular dielectric cylinder, and a dielectric sphere. The accuracy of the method is further illustrated by comparing predictions with independent measurements by R.A. Ross (1966) on a 2 lambda *1 lambda metal plate at grazing incidence. In all cases, agreement is excellent.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/1421/00034141.pdf","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.34141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.34141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1421","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The discrete Fourier transform method of solving differential-integral equations in scattering theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Integral equations","Differential equations","Convolution","Dielectrics","Electromagnetic scattering","Application software","Finite difference methods","Fast Fourier transforms","Gradient methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","fast Fourier transforms","integro-differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transform","differential-integral equations","scattering theory","numerical method","electromagnetic scattering","derivatives","convolution integrals","fast Fourier transform","conjugate gradient method","metal plate","infinite circular dielectric cylinder","dielectric sphere"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"The discrete Fourier transform method of solving differential-integral equations in scattering theory","volume":"37","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3499807","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The discrete Fourier transform method of solving differential-integral equations in scattering theory","sourcePdf":"00034141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046427S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"55","articleId":"34141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":34144,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

Root-mean-square delay spread ( sigma ) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median sigma values were 96 ns for line-of-sight paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst-case sigma or 300 ns was measured in a modern open-plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver separation or factory topography but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wideband path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous-wave measurements made at identical locations. It is shown that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1989","volume":"37","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3499810","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of UHF multipath radio channels in factory buildings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of UHF multipath radio channels in factory buildings","sourcePdf":"00034144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036606S","chronDate":"Aug 1989","isNumber":"1421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"287","articleId":"34144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34149,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

The students are given choices of courses, but also a coherent guideline to form a useful and stimulating overall program, whether their specialty lies within electrical engineering or computer science. Links are made in the courses to encompass topics from technology and electronics to software development for CAD (computer-aided design) packages.

The presence of heavy metal contamination of the Si surface as a result of dry etching was confirmed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy and SECCO etch defect decoration. C-t (minority-carrier lifetime) measurements on special guard ring devices were used as indirect evidence of heavy metal contaminants. The quality of a gate oxide grown on Si surfaces after dry-etching conditions was examined through breakdown voltage. Improved device electron mobility was observed for the RIE-exposed Si surface compared to PE, due to the smoother surface after the RIE process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34219/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3499819","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"36","issue":"9","displayDocTitle":"A study of contamination and damage on Si surfaces induced by dry etching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of contamination and damage on Si surfaces induced by dry etching","sourcePdf":"00034219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050045S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"23","articleId":"34219","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34224,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

Defects in the AB barriers of previous designs often caused dark columns in the array by draining away all the signal charge from the defective pixel. This design minimizes this serious yield-loss mechanisms by reducing the AB barrier-to-well perimeter to a minimum and by isolating the remaining drain-to-well perimeter with a high-integrity channel stop. A further process economy and yield enhancing feature is that the antiblooming barrier is formed from the same implants as the pixel barrier, insuring that the AB barrier potential is the appropriate value for proper antiblooming action. The fabrication process adds only one mask level to the conventional sensor process flow. The structure preserves all of the prized aspects of barrier and drain AB, high normal and flash overload tolerance, as well as simple system requirements. The structure has been demonstrated in a virtual-phase CCD sensor, and operating results are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/1424/00034224.pdf","startPage":"1634","endPage":"1638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.34224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.34224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1424","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A channel-stop-defined barrier and drain antiblooming structure for virtual phase CCD image sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge-coupled image sensors","Charge coupled devices","Layout","Fabrication","Lighting","Optical imaging","Optical sensors","Radiative recombination","Clocks","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","integrated circuit technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel-stop-defined barrier","drain antiblooming structure","virtual phase CCD image sensors","process economy","yield enhancing feature","antiblooming barrier","pixel barrier","fabrication process","mask level"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","displayDocTitle":"A channel-stop-defined barrier and drain antiblooming structure for virtual phase CCD image sensors","volume":"36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3499824","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A channel-stop-defined barrier and drain antiblooming structure for virtual phase CCD image sensors","sourcePdf":"00034224.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057302S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"34224","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34226,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Here, it is shown that, due to incorrect extrapolation of the results, important memory degradation phenomena, such as window opening, are prone to misinterpretation. The results of a study on the degradation of tunnel-oxide floating-gate EEPROM devices, making use of the charge-pumping technique in combination with threshold voltage window degradation measurements, are reported. Contacted floating-gate transistors were used to study the effect of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling on thin-oxide gate dielectrics. Different types of floating-gate transistors were subjected to different degradation conditions. By comparing the experimental results with those of a theoretical study of the influence of trapped oxide charges on injection current and threshold voltage, it is possible to explain all measured degradation characteristics unambiguously.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.34229","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"1663","endPage":"1682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/1424/00034229.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.34229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradation of tunnel-oxide floating-gate EEPROM devices and the correlation with high field-current-induced degradation of thin gate oxides","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","EPROM","Nonvolatile memory","Threshold voltage","Current measurement","Dielectric measurements","MOSFETs","Stress","MOS capacitors","Extrapolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EPROM","insulated gate field effect transistors","integrated memory circuits","MOS integrated circuits","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunnel-oxide floating-gate EEPROM devices","correlation","high field-current-induced degradation","thin gate oxides","MOS transistors","thin-oxide floating-gate memory cells","high field stress","experimental results","memory degradation phenomena","window opening","degradation","charge-pumping technique","threshold voltage window degradation","Fowler-Nordheim tunneling","thin-oxide gate dielectrics","floating-gate transistors","degradation conditions","experimental results","theoretical study","trapped oxide charges","injection current"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Degradation of tunnel-oxide floating-gate EEPROM devices and the correlation with high field-current-induced degradation of thin gate oxides","volume":"36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3499829","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34229/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation of tunnel-oxide floating-gate EEPROM devices and the correlation with high field-current-induced degradation of thin gate oxides","sourcePdf":"00034229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06731S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"54","articleId":"34229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":34242,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The conventional carrier number fluctuation model of 1/f noise that attributes 1/f noise to the trapping and detrapping of inversion layer carriers by oxide traps is reviewed. It is shown that oxide band bending in devices with a nonuniform oxide trap distribution leads to a gate voltage dependence in the magnitude and exponent gamma (V/sub gs/) of the 1/f/sup gamma / noise spectrum. An extension of the 1/f noise number fluctuation model that includes both carrier number fluctuations and correlated mobility fluctuations is then studied. Correlated mobility fluctuations are attributed to the coulombic scattering of inversion layer carriers by the fluctuating trapped charge. It is shown that the correlated fluctuation model predicts a gate voltage dependence in the magnitude and exponent gamma of the 1/f/sup gamma / noise spectrum even for a uniform oxide trap distribution. By analyzing the 1/f noise magnitude and exponent data in n-channel MOSFETs having various oxide thicknesses, both models are used to extract the oxide trap density over a wide range of space and energy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3499841","displayDocTitle":"A 1/f noise technique to extract the oxide trap density near the conduction band edge of silicon","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1/f noise technique to extract the oxide trap density near the conduction band edge of silicon","sourcePdf":"00034242.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033959S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"301","articleId":"34242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":34247,"authors":[{"name":"K.

On the basis of an analysis applicable to a wide range of semiconducting materials and by using the available measured physical parameters, it is shown that wide-bandgap semiconductors such as SiC and diamond could offer significant advantages compared to either silicon or group III-V compound semiconductors for these applications. The analysis uses peak electric field strength at avalanche breakdown as a critical material parameter for evaluating the quality of a semiconducting material for high-power electronics. Theoretical calculations show improvement by orders of magnitude in the on-resistance, twentyfold improvement in the maximum frequency of operation, and potential for successful operation at temperatures beyond 600 degrees C for diamond high-power devices. New figures of merit for power-handling capability that emphasize electrical and thermal conductivities of the material are derived and are applied to various semiconducting materials. It is shown that an improvement in power-handling capabilities of semiconductor devices by three orders of magnitude is feasible by replacing silicon with silicon carbide; improvement in power-handling capability by six orders of magnitude is projected for diamond-based devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.34247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/1424/00034247.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.34247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1424","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum semiconductors for high-power electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34247","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum semiconductors for high-power electronics","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34247/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3499845","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum semiconductors for high-power electronics","sourcePdf":"00034247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057233S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"471","articleId":"34247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":34248,"authors":[{"name":"H.-R.

This device structure was fabricated using a self-aligned process that permits closely spaced vertical trench gates with a unit cell of 6 mu m. This allows for a fivefold increase of channel density and elimination of the parasitic JFET effect, thus reducing the forward voltage drop significantly. A static latching current density of 2700 A/cm/sup 2/ has been achieved in the UMOS-IGBT. Two-dimensional computer simulations of the UMOS-IGBT have been performed to identify the optimal cell design.

Leakage currents below 1 nA at drain-source voltages of 40 V were achieved in both n-type and p-type devices. The effective channel electron and hole mobilities were 75 and 42 cm/sup 2//V-s, respectively. Measured stage delay times for CMOS ring oscillators as a function of supply voltage agreed well with theoretical calculations. The effective carrier mobility was shown to have a minimum at a gate voltage corresponding to the point at which all traps are filled. Both dark and photoinduced leakage currents were determined to be controlled by generation from the grain boundary traps. The voltage drop across individual gates in multigated structures was investigated as a function of gate voltage. The use of multiple gates at high drain-source potentials was found to decrease both dark and photoinduced leakage currents.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/1424/00034270.pdf","startPage":"1915","endPage":"1922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.34270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.34270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1424","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and electrical properties of undoped polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leakage current","Voltage","Silicon","Thin film transistors","Charge carrier processes","Electron mobility","Delay","Ring oscillators","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Grain boundaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier mobility","CMOS integrated circuits","electron traps","elemental semiconductors","grain boundaries","silicon","thin film transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polysilicon","n-type devices","electron mobilities","electrical properties","thin-film transistors","conduction mechanism","leakage current","undoped channel","drain-source voltages","p-type devices","hole mobilities","stage delay times","CMOS ring oscillators","effective carrier mobility","photoinduced leakage currents","grain boundary traps","voltage drop","multigated structures","multiple gates","drain-source potentials","40 V","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Development and electrical properties of undoped polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors","volume":"36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3499865","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and electrical properties of undoped polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors","sourcePdf":"00034270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038882S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"212","articleId":"34270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34278,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.M.

It is shown that the accuracy requirements are quite severe for lower voltage impacts, up to about three times V/sub max/ (where V/sub max/ is the voltage at which the normal secondary emission ratio reaches its maximum value, delta /sub max/), but are less stringent above this range. A new formula for the low-voltage region, which agrees with experimental data better than the formula of R.G. Lye and A.J. Dekker (1957), is proposed. For the voltage region above 4 V/sub max/, the Lye and Dekker formula is retained, with a smooth transition centered between 3 and 4 V/sub max/. The directional effect is modeled by adjusting the values of delta /sub max/ and V/sub max/ before applying either formula, rather than applying either Bruining's or Muller's correction factor afterward. This results in an automatic modeling of the known absence of any appreciable directional effect below about half V/sub max/.

Application of the frequency-derivative approach is demonstrated for problems having well-defined resonances such as a dipole antenna, and for more challenging problems having narrow resonances.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.34291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.34291","startPage":"2807","endPage":"2809","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/1425/00034291.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using model-based parameter estimation to increase the efficiency of computing electromagnetic transfer functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1989","displayDocTitle":"Using model-based parameter estimation to increase the efficiency of computing electromagnetic transfer functions","publicationDate":"July 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3499962","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34291/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using model-based parameter estimation to increase the efficiency of computing electromagnetic transfer functions","sourcePdf":"00034291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043706S","chronDate":"July  1989","isNumber":"1425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"83","articleId":"34291","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":34292,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

The results suggest that parallel codes are capable of exceeding lattice sizes and executing faster than even Cray-based codes for lattices optimally matched to the Connection Machines memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.34321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/1425/00034321.pdf","startPage":"2910","endPage":"2912","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00034321.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.34321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting scattering of electromagnetic fields using FD-TD on a Connection Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34321/","displayDocTitle":"Predicting scattering of electromagnetic fields using FD-TD on a Connection Machine","volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3499992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting scattering of electromagnetic fields using FD-TD on a Connection Machine","sourcePdf":"00034321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025914S","chronDate":"July  1989","isNumber":"1425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"16","articleId":"34321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":34331,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Silvester (1973) described a finite element method that combines geometrical flexibility with a partial-fraction representation of the admittance matrices of the general N-port. His method was demonstrated for a rectangular strip. However, to the author's knowledge the method has never been demonstrated on other two-port networks or on multiport planar microwave circuits. Frequency-dependent admittance, impedance and scattering matrices are obtained here for complicated two-port planar circuits, using Silvester's method. Comparison with other methods and measurements is made where possible.

Operated with an applied bias near 7 V the device responds to the absorption of an incident photon with a submicrosecond-risetime current pulse with a narrow amplitude distribution well above the electronic readout noise levels. Optimal photon-counting performance occurs between 6 and 10 K and for count rates less than 10/sup 10/ counts/s/cm/sup 2/ of detector area. A 60% counting quantum efficiency has been demonstrated at 20 mu m, and near 60% was observed in the visible light region. The underlying mechanism involves extremely fast internal charge amplification by impact ionization of impurity-band electrons and results in a pulse for each photoelectrically or thermally induced free carrier. The thermally induced dark pulse rate at 7 K is sufficiently low that background-limited detector performance is obtained at a background of less than 10/sup 6/ photons/cm/sup 2/ s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00034424.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/23/1426/00034424.pdf","doi":"10.1109/23.34424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.34424","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photon-counting solid-state photomultiplier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34424/","displayDocTitle":"Photon-counting solid-state photomultiplier","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"3401727","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photon-counting solid-state photomultiplier","sourcePdf":"00034424.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029802S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"1426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"45","articleId":"34424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34427,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Bulk damage or displacement damage is a process in which silicon atoms are displaced from their normal lattice positions by high energy photons or particles. Single atomic displacements or cluster defect damage in silicon is produced depending on the energy and type of radiation experienced by the detector. Bulk damage creates trapping sites within the CCD's signal channel which in turn degrades CTE performance. Ionization-induced damage induces a buildup of charge in the CCD's gate insulator causing the sensor's drive operating windows to shift (i.e. flat-band shift). In addition, ionization damage creates unwanted electronic sites at the gate's interface causing the CCD's dark current to increase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/23/1426/00034503.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/23.34503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.34503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1426","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation damage in scientific charge-coupled devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ionization","Atomic measurements","Ionizing radiation","Charge coupled devices","Lattices","Radiation detectors","Silicon radiation detectors","Electron traps","Degradation","Insulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge-coupled devices","radiation effects","semiconductor counters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation damage","scientific CCD","ionization effects","displacement damage","cluster defect damage","trapping sites","signal channel","gate insulator","flat-band shift","ionization damage","dark current"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Radiation damage in scientific charge-coupled devices","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3517618","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation damage in scientific charge-coupled devices","sourcePdf":"00034503.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049061S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"1426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"69","articleId":"34503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34585,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

The design complexity of the architecture was kept manageable by replicating a single module 56 times within the array.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.34604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/23/1426/00034604.pdf","startPage":"1052","endPage":"1055","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00034604.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.34604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coincidence detection and selection in positron emission tomography using VLSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34604/","displayDocTitle":"Coincidence detection and selection in positron emission tomography using VLSI","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3410186","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coincidence detection and selection in positron emission tomography using VLSI","sourcePdf":"00034604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048187S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"1426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"14","articleId":"34604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34605,"authors":[{"name":"D.W.

The use of PMTs in three areas of medical imaging is examined: (1) Anger camera and SPECT (single-photon-emission computed tomography); (2) PET (positron emission tomography); and (3) stimulated luminescence radiography. In SPECT, rotating Anger cameras are most widely used at present, but various systems have been developed. In response to these developments, the quality of PMTs has been continuously improved and adapted to the above applications. In PET, much severer requirements are imposed on PMTs. For high-spatial-resolution PET, the appropriate size and shape would be a detector ring with closely packed, small scintillation crystals. For time-of-flight PET, fast timing and high sensitivity for ultraviolet light are essential. The invention of digital radiography based on an X-ray imaging plate (scanner laser stimulated luminescence) has motivated the development of a PMT with a long sensitive area.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.34608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1426","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1083","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/23/1426/00034608.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New photomultiplier tubes for medical imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"New photomultiplier tubes for medical imaging","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","accessionNumber":"3410190","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"36","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New photomultiplier tubes for medical imaging","sourcePdf":"00034608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072111S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"1426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"14","articleId":"34608","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":34609,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

Each segment is individually connected to a low-noise charge amplifier. The photodiodes and crystals are cooled to -100 degrees C to reduce dark current and increase the BGO signal. With an amplifier peaking time of 17 mu s, the sum of the signals (511-keV photopeak) was 3200 electrons with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 750 electrons.

A mathematical correction of emission data is performed using a two-dimensional spatially variant deconvolution of the emission data in sinogram format. Examples for the Donner 600 crystal positron tomograph are presented, and the amplification of statistical errors resulting from the correction procedure is discussed. The proposed compensation method appears to amplify statistical noise a great deal in order to gain a modest improvement in radial resolution. The statistical correlations in the corrected projections are so high that images resulting from statistically poor data are expected to have a high degree of correlated noise. Preliminary tests indicate that the method causes artifacts for data generated from point sources, because the assumptions made when the blurring transition probabilities were calculated are not met.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.34612","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00034612.png","startPage":"1100","endPage":"1107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.34612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1426","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel4/23/1426/00034612.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation for crystal penetration in high resolution positron tomography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34612/","displayDocTitle":"Compensation for crystal penetration in high resolution positron tomography","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3410194","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation for crystal penetration in high resolution positron tomography","sourcePdf":"00034612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030191S","chronDate":"Feb.  1989","isNumber":"1426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"31","articleId":"34612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":34613,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

Quantization is treated as an optimization problem, and the tradeoffs among sampling rate, quantization stepsize, and quantization distortion are examined. It is shown that symmetric neural networks offer a natural means for efficient implementation of the proposed technique. Applications include digital image halftoning, as well as all forms of PCM coding and oversampled A/D conversion. It is shown that concepts and structures used in digital image halftoning are directly applicable to oversampled sigma-delta modulation of sound signals. A novel kind of parallel analog network is introduced and shown to be appropriate for this task. These networks contain a nonmonotonic nonlinearity in lieu of the sigmoid function and perform error diffusion in all directions.

Using equations derived by the authors in a previous publication (ibid., vol.CAS-34, no.2, p.149-59, 1987), the analysis of the amplifier is performed at any values of the derivative of the switch voltage, load resistance, and operating frequency. The experimental switch current and voltage waveforms were in agreement with theoretical predictions. The measured efficiencies were 91 and 88% at 2 MHz in the amplifier with an antiparallel diode and a series diode, respectively.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/31/1427/00034665.pdf","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/31.34665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/31.34665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1427","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Class E tuned power amplifier with antiparallel diode or series diode at switch, with any loaded Q and switch duty cycle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diodes","Switches","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Operational amplifiers","Frequency","Switching circuits","High power amplifiers","Parasitic capacitance","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network analysis","power amplifiers","Q-factor","switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tuned power amplifier","antiparallel diode","series diode","loaded Q","switch duty cycle","class E","switching-mode","load resistance","operating frequency","switch voltage","91 percent","88 percent","2 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","displayDocTitle":"Class E tuned power amplifier with antiparallel diode or series diode at switch, with any loaded Q and switch duty cycle","volume":"36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3500294","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Class E tuned power amplifier with antiparallel diode or series diode at switch, with any loaded Q and switch duty cycle","sourcePdf":"00034665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026932S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"31","citationCount":"55","articleId":"34665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34666,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Physical considerations provide theoretical limits on the search space, but the theoretically maximum allowable space is still often much larger than the smallest rectangular symmetric subspace that contains the optimal transformation. To reduce the search time, the current practice is to guess an optimal subspace from the maximum allowable space. This reduced space is then discretized and searched. An automatic technique to estimate adaptively a subspace from the maximum space during the search process itself is described.

The lag effect is reduced by a straightforward weighted subtraction, which has the undesirable side effect of increasing noise. By superimposing several lag-corrected and appropriately shifted images, however, the signal-to-noise ratio can be restored. The algorithm uses the phase-correlation method to measure the two-dimensional shift of a mobile coronary arterial structure. Processing is confined to a rectangular area of interest (AOI), which encloses a feature of clinical significance. The differences of the phases of the Fourier transforms of two frames is computed, combined with an appropriate filter, and inverse Fourier-transformed to produce a phase-correlation image. The vector separation from the origin of image space of the peak of the phase-correlation image is the estimate of the shift of the artery's position in the second frame as compared to the first. The isolation of the AOI from the surrounding image is achieved by the application of a window and correction for any linear trend in the background intensity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Translational motion compensation for coronary angiogram sequences","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.34717","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/1431/00034717.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"282","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00034717.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.34717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=34717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34717/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Translational motion compensation for coronary angiogram sequences","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3498743","pubMedId":"18230526","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Translational motion compensation for coronary angiogram sequences","sourcePdf":"00034717.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055656S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"13","articleId":"34717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":34753,"authors":[{"name":"I.

An expert system was also developed to clarify the issues involved in human grasp choice. Comparisons of the grasp taxonomy, the expert system, and grasp-quality measures derived from the analytic models reveal that the analytic measures are useful for describing grasps in manufacturing tasks despite the limitations in the models.

It is derived by using d'Alembert's principle and obtained without computing the Lagrange Multipliers. To account for the constraints, only the Jacobian matrix of the passive joint angles in terms of actuated ones is required. Given a nonredundant actuator system, this allows a unique representation of the constraints even for complicated multiloop closed-link mechanisms. The inverse dynamics of closed-link mechanisms that contain redundant actuators and their redundancy optimization are also discussed. For a redundant actuation system that contains N/sub r/ redundant actuators, the passive joint angles are represented by N/sub r/+1 independent ways as functions of actuated joints. Using their Jacobian matrices, the actuation redundancy of a closed-link mechanism is parameterized by an N/sub r/-dimensional arbitrary vector in a linear equation.

It takes only about 100+64N arithmetic operations to compute the hand/eye relationship after the robot finishes the movement, and incurs only additional 64 arithmetic operations for each additional station. The robot makes a series of automatically planned movements with a camera rigidly mounted at the gripper. At the end of each move, it takes a total of 90 ms to grab an image, extract image feature coordinates, and perform camera extrinsic calibration. After the robot finishes all the movements, it takes only a few milliseconds to do the calibration. A series of generic geometric properties or lemmas are presented, leading to the derivation of the final algorithms, which are aimed at simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy while giving ample geometric and algebraic insights. Critical factors influencing the accuracy are analyzed, and procedures for improving accuracy are introduced. Test results of both simulation and real experiments on an IBM Cartesian robot are reported and analyzed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.34770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/1436/00034770.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"358","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00034770.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.34770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new technique for fully autonomous and efficient 3D robotics hand/eye calibration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"A new technique for fully autonomous and efficient 3D robotics hand/eye calibration","volume":"5","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3447301","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/34770/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new technique for fully autonomous and efficient 3D robotics hand/eye calibration","sourcePdf":"00034770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037359S","chronDate":"Jun 1989","isNumber":"1436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"687","articleId":"34770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":34777,"authors":[{"name":"I.-J.

In contrast to existing methods, this approach can be applied to cases involving discrete (e.g. integer-valued) parameters such as queue capacities or routing thresholds. However, the basic method is limited by some rather restrictive observability conditions. These conditions are relaxed through an observability transformation which generalizes the method's applicability. Direct extensions to more general (non-Markovian) DES are also presented via a simplified generalized semi-Markov process reformulation of the approach.

Four paraplegic subjects were tested before and after an eight-week program in which the quadriceps were exercised daily with electrical simulation. It was found that 12.6+or-2.9 iterations were required to approximate the desired trajectory. The average error of the final match between the actual and desired trajectories was 2.1 degrees +or-0.7. Repeated responses were extremely consistent; the average difference between successive trails was less than 1 degrees in 81% of the trials. When the stimulation sequence was repeated every 3 s for 50 cycles, however, there was a progressive degradation in the response, even in exercised legs, that demonstrated the limitations of open-loop control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.35298","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/1465/00035298.pdf","startPage":"895","endPage":"905","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.35298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-loop control of the freely-swinging paralyzed leg","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Open-loop control of the freely-swinging paralyzed leg","volume":"36","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3508965","pubMedId":"2777279","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-loop control of the freely-swinging paralyzed leg","sourcePdf":"00035298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037752S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"21","articleId":"35298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":35307,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

The data points were fitted to both expressions, and the ability of each to predict the measured values were determined. The Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm was used to fit the Lapicque and Blair expressions. The Lapicque data were also fitted to the linear charge-duration expression of Weiss (W). The ratio of the predicted to measured current was 0.95 (L-M) and 1.06 (W) for the Lapicque and 0.92 (L-M) for the Blair expression. Thus, there appears to be little difference between the ability of the expressions to fit the same experimentally obtained data.

In the controller, one network is used to learn to reproduce the nonlinear relationship between the sensor outputs and the system command variables over particular regions of the system state space. The learned information is used to predict the command signals required to produce desired changes in the sensor outputs. A second network is used to learn to reproduce the nonlinear relationship between the system command variables and the changes in the video sensor outputs. The learned information from this network is then used to predict the next set of video parameters, effectively compensating for the image processing delays. The results of learning experiments using a General Electric P-5 manipulator are presented. These experiments involved control of the position and orientation of an object in the field of view of a video camera mounted on the end of the robot arm, using moving objects with arbitrary orientation relative to the robot. No a priori knowledge of the robot kinematics or of the object speed of orientation relative to the robot was assumed. Image parameter uncertainty and control system tracking error in the video image were found to converge to low values within a few trials.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.35345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel3/21/1468/00035345.pdf","startPage":"825","endPage":"831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.35345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time application of neural networks for sensor-based control of robots with vision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=35345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35345/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time application of neural networks for sensor-based control of robots with vision","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3509183","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time application of neural networks for sensor-based control of robots with vision","sourcePdf":"00035345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089675S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1989","isNumber":"1468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"177","articleId":"35345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":35349,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

RIPS provides sufficient computing capacity to attack important real-time sensory-based robot control problems. Compliant control, multiple manipulator coordination, and manufacturing cell-level integration are presently under study. Experimental testing in these areas is possible because of RIPS' high computational performance for robot control problems: a Stanford manipulator using the computed torque method can be controlled with an update time of 255 mu s.

The model proposed updates simultaneously groups of a fixed number of neurons that are disjoint in the sense that each neuron belongs to one and only one group. An analysis is presented of the case in which one of the groups is chosen at random with equal probability and then is updated according to a rule equivalent to the one given by J.J. Hopfield (1982).

Sufficient conditions on the corresponding connection matrix as to ensure stability are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.35355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel3/21/1468/00035355.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"888","doi":"10.1109/21.35355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial simultaneous updating in Hopfield memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1989","displayDocTitle":"Partial simultaneous updating in Hopfield memories","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1989","accessionNumber":"3509193","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial simultaneous updating in Hopfield memories","sourcePdf":"00035355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029371S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1989","isNumber":"1468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"12","articleId":"35355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":35370,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The authors suppose that the network supports K classes of calls where each class is determined by a fixed route and a bandwidth requirement. A Markov decision process (MDP) approach is used to obtain optimal access policies for three models: the flexible scheme access-port model where a single link is shared; the contiguous scheme access-port model where wideband calls are required to occupy specific contiguous regions of the TDM frame; and the network-access model where a call holds several channels in different links simultaneously. Both linear programming and value-iteration MDP algorithms are coupled with a novel state descriptor in order to locate the optimal policy for reasonable-size problems (several T1 carriers in parallel for the access-port case, and small networks of T1 carriers for the network-access case).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.35373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1470","startPage":"934","endPage":"939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1470/00035373.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal circuit access policies in an ISDN environment: a Markov decision approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal circuit access policies in an ISDN environment: a Markov decision approach","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3517771","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal circuit access policies in an ISDN environment: a Markov decision approach","sourcePdf":"00035373.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034946S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"123","articleId":"35373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":35376,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

It is shown that the system can be represented as an affine operation (discrete-time integration of a biased input) followed by a memoryless nonlinearity. An extension of the transform method for the analysis of nonlinear systems is applied to obtain formulas for first- and second-order time-average moments of the binary quantization noise, including the sample mean, energy, and autocorrelation. The results are applied to the special case of a sinusoidal input signal to evaluate these time averages and the power spectrum. In the limit of large oversampling ratios, the marginal moments behave as if the quantization noise had a uniform distribution. The spectrum is neither white nor continuous, however, even in the limit of large oversampling ratios.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.35376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/1470/00035376.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.35376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1470","startPage":"956","endPage":"968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantization noise in single-loop sigma-delta modulation with sinusoidal inputs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=35376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantization noise in single-loop sigma-delta modulation with sinusoidal inputs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35376/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3517773","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantization noise in single-loop sigma-delta modulation with sinusoidal inputs","sourcePdf":"00035376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038113S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"90","articleId":"35376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":35379,"authors":[{"name":"Dae Young Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dae Young Kim","id":"37068058100"},{"name":"K.

The proposed techniques are based on a space-time statistic called the steered covariance matrix (STCM). The STCM, like the well-known cross-spectral density matrix (CSDM), has asymptotic properties which facilitate high-resolution source localization. In broadband settings, however, the STCM has the advantage that it can be estimated with much greater statistical stability than the CSDM. The STCM is used in conjunction with minimum variance and linear predictive spectral estimation to obtain the steered minimum variance (STMV) and steered linear prediction (STLP) methods. Analytical and simulation results are presented that indicate that the STMV and STLP methods exhibit lower threshold observation times than their CSDM-based counterparts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3517847","displayDocTitle":"Multiple broad-band source location using steered covariance matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple broad-band source location using steered covariance matrices","sourcePdf":"00035386.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038327S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"122","articleId":"35386","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":35387,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Each component of the mixture is regarded as a prototype for the labeling phase of a hidden Markov model based speech recognition system. Since the ambient noise during recognition can differ from that present in the training data, the model is designed for convenient updating in changing noise. Based on the observation that the energy in a frequency band is at any fixed time dominated either by signal energy or by noise energy, the energy is modeled as the larger of the separate energies of signal and noise in the band. Statistical algorithms are given for training this as a hidden variables model. The hidden variables are the prototype identities and the separate signal and noise components. Speech recognition experiments that successfully utilize this model are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3517848","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Speech recognition using noise-adaptive prototypes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech recognition using noise-adaptive prototypes","sourcePdf":"00035387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030095S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"123","articleId":"35387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":35393,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The PNN algorithm derives a vector quantization codebook in a diminishingly small fraction of the time previously required, without sacrificing performance. In addition, the time needed to generate a codebook grows only O(N log N) in training set size and is independent of the number of code words desired. Using this method, one can either minimize the number of code words needed subject to a maximum rate. The PNN algorithm can be used with squared error and weighted squared error distortion measure. Simulations on a variety of images encoded at 1/2 b/pixel indicate that PNN codebooks can be developed in roughly 5% of the time required by the LBG algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/29.35395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/29/1471/00035395.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/29.35395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1471","startPage":"1568","endPage":"1575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new vector quantization clustering algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=35395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new vector quantization clustering algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3517856","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new vector quantization clustering algorithm","sourcePdf":"00035395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040671S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"29","citationCount":"272","articleId":"35395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":35407,"authors":[{"name":"F.A.

In order to do this, it is necessary to solve the general mapmaker's problem for representing curved surfaces by planar models. This algorithm has applications in areas other than computer-aided neuroanatomy, such as robotics motion planning and geophysics. The algorithm maximizes the goodness of fit distances in these surfaces to distances in a planar configuration of points. It is illustrated with a flattening of monkey visual cortex, which is an extremely complex folded surface. Distance errors in the range of several percent are found, with isolated regions of larger error, for the class of cortical surfaces studied so far.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35506/","volume":"11","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"3509349","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A numerical solution to the generalized mapmaker's problem: flattening nonconvex polyhedral surfaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A numerical solution to the generalized mapmaker's problem: flattening nonconvex polyhedral surfaces","sourcePdf":"00035506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054811S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"110","articleId":"35506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":35508,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

The proposed approach is applicable as an offline technique at either production time and/or run time. Reconfiguration is implemented by index mapping using a sequence of two operators. A reconfiguration algorithm which utilizes index mapping is proposed. This algorithm uses a new approach to the assignment problem. It is shown that reconfiguration of fault-free cells is equivalent to a covering of faulty cells by spare cells. It is also established that in a two-dimensional array the optimal spare assignment is given by a maximum matching. This translates to a maximum flow.

The variables in this problem are the routing on the express pipes (i.e. the channels that interconnect the P/S modes) and the allocation of bandwidth to such pipes. An efficient algorithm is presented for the solution of the above problem and it is applied to some representative examples. It is shown that for some test cases the congestion measure is substantially reduced with respect to the values obtained when the embedded topology is kept identical to the backbone topology.

He describes an experiment that he designed to find out if real differences in comprehension exist between structured flowcharts and pseudocode when used to describe conditional logic. He hypothesized that structured flowcharts (1) take less time to comprehend, (2) produce fewer errors in understanding, (3) give students more confidence in their understanding of an algorithm, (4) reduce the time spent answering questions about an algorithm, and (5) reduce the number of times students need to look at an algorithm. These hypotheses were tested on three algorithms of varying complexity. The results strongly indicate that structured flowcharts do indeed aid algorithm comprehension. A large difference was found even for the simplest algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/52.35587","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00035587.png","startPage":"28","publicationTitle":"IEEE Software","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/52/1485/00035587.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/52.35587","endPage":"36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured flowcharts outperform pseudocode: an experimental comparison","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1989","displayDocTitle":"Structured flowcharts outperform pseudocode: an experimental comparison","volume":"6","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3508646","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2004","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured flowcharts outperform pseudocode: an experimental comparison","sourcePdf":"00035587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036726S","chronDate":"Sept.  1989","isNumber":"1485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"76","articleId":"35587","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":35628,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

In the proposed method, the leakage current to ground of each element of the grounding grid is represented more realistically than by considering the grid as an equivalent circular plate. Vertical ground rods of the grid are also considered. The maximum voltage to which a station grounding grid is raised due to incident impulse current can be determined. This is an important criterion in evaluating the transient performance of substation grounding grids which are generally designed from the point of view of power frequency fault currents. It has been found from both analytical and field studies that, in cases where impulse current injection is at the corner of the grid, the voltage induced and hence the impulse impedance are the highest. If the impulse current is incident at any other location within the grid, the grid exhibits a lower value of impulse impedance. Comparison of analytical results and field results shows good correlation for maximum induced voltages and impulse impedances.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00035630.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/1488/00035630.pdf","startPage":"2053","endPage":"2059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.35630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.35630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=35630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient performance of grounding grids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grounding","Power system transients","Inductance","Lightning","Mathematical model","Transient analysis","Transmission line matrix methods","Grid computing","Performance analysis","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earth electrodes","substations","transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertical ground rods","induced voltage","grounding grids","transient performance","leakage current","incident impulse current","substation grounding grids","power frequency fault currents","impulse current injection","impulse impedance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"Transient performance of grounding grids","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3519350","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient performance of grounding grids","sourcePdf":"00035630.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040157S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"86","articleId":"35630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":35652,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

The method is based on operator procedures and usually generates the same solutions as operators would do. However, it is also possible to investigate alternatives that normally would not be considered by system operators, which can be very helpful under certain critical operating conditions. Moreover, the proposed framework makes it possible to investigate the effect of practical rules on the optimality of the final solution and so can be a useful tool in designing new algorithms.

The simulator is based on Marti's time-domain formulation, which is adopted in the EMPT program. Improvements are made to speed up the calculation to realize real-time digital simulation. It obtains the electromagnetic transient performance of an unbalanced three-phase line in real time. Sample results of a single line to ground short circuit on an open-ended three-phase transmission line are presented.

Applications have been demonstrated in the design and analysis of special-purpose accelerators for Monte Carlo simulation of large intractable systems.

Two major steps of image registration, control-point selection and control-point matching, are emphasized. In control-point selection, the properties that a good control point should satisfy are defined. Several potential control-point candidates are suggested, and methods are discussed for extracting them from the input image. In control-point matching, a relaxation algorithm proposed in the literature is improved by reducing its time complexity from O(n/sup 4/) to O(n/sup 3/), where n is the number of control points. The matching algorithm also uses a two-way matching concept which utilizes the inherent symmetry property of the point-matching problem. The robustness of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated through simulation experiments by evaluating a matching index. Experimental results on Landsat images show that the proposed method produces results comparable to those obtained by an experienced photointerpreter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.1989.35948","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/1504/00035948.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.1989.35948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1504","startPage":"642","endPage":"651","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00035948.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Registering Landsat images by point matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=35948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Registering Landsat images by point matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/35948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1989","accessionNumber":"3537787","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Registering Landsat images by point matching","sourcePdf":"00035948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042446S","chronDate":"Sep 1989","isNumber":"1504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"135","articleId":"35948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":35955,"authors":[{"name":"C.-C.T.

The CMOS stuck-open fault is discussed from a physical viewpoint, with results given from failure analysis of ICs having this failure mode. The results show that among functional, stuck-at, stuck-open, and I/sub DDQ/ test strategies, no single method guarantees detection of all types of CMOS defects. The I/sub DDQ/ test is the most sensitive and comprehensive, but can miss certain open-circuit defects and is a relatively slow measurement technique. The test-vector approach detects fewer of the CMOS defects, but can run at fast clock rates to detect certain open-circuit faults that may not be detectable by the I/sub DDQ/ test. Maximal CMOS IC defect detection involves a mixed-mode strategy of I/sub DDQ/ tests and vector stimulus/response tests.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1989] Proceedings of the 1st European Test Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/241/1513/00036238.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"167","publicationTitle":"[1989] Proceedings of the 1st European Test Conference","doi":"10.1109/ETC.1989.36238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETC.1989.36238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=36238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical properties and detection methods for CMOS IC defects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Circuit testing","Circuit faults","Degradation","Logic testing","Integrated circuit testing","Failure analysis","Production","Automatic testing","CMOS logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","fault location","integrated circuit testing","integrated logic circuits","logic testing","production testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","short circuit defects","functional testing","logic testing","production testing","CMOS IC defects","CMOS failure modes","test vector","parametric test","stuck-open fault","failure analysis","I/sub DDQ/ test","open-circuit defects","test-vector","mixed-mode strategy","vector stimulus/response tests"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/36238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"Electrical properties and detection methods for CMOS IC defects","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463072","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 April 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical properties and detection methods for CMOS IC defects","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00036238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05115S","chronDate":"12-14 Apr 1989","isNumber":"1513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"241","citationCount":"108","articleId":"36238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":36243,"authors":[{"name":"P.

She distinguishes several different types of aggregation and inference problems and shows that the different types of problems are best addressed by different approaches. In particular, it is shown that sensitive associations among entities of different types are best treated by representing the sensitive association separately and classifying the individual entities low and the relationship high. Sensitive associations among the various properties of an entity are best treated by determining those properties that contribute most to the inference and by storing those separately at a higher classification. Sensitive associations among entities of the same type are best treated by storing the individual data items comprising the aggregate at the aggregate-high classification; they must be sanitized for release to lower-level users. The suggested approaches allow the mandatory reference monitor to protect the sensitive associations, with no additional trusted mechanism needed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SECPRI.1989.36284","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel2/243/1514/00036284.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SECPRI.1989.36284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggregation and inference: facts and fallacies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/36284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Aggregation and inference: facts and fallacies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472397","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregation and inference: facts and fallacies","confLoc":"Oakland, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00036284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05768S","chronDate":"1-3 May 1989","isNumber":"1514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"243","citationCount":"42","articleId":"36284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":36302,"authors":[{"name":"H.S.

The leakage current and time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) characteristics are comparable for both planar and trench type ONO structures. Therefore the test results are not specific to trench structures only but are common characteristics of ONO films. Breakdown voltage of the ONO film is dependent on gate bias polarity and the ratio of bottom-oxide to top-oxide thicknesses. In general, the current is controlled by the exit-oxide thickness for electron current in the ONO film. The mean time to failure becomes longer as the nitride thickness increases. This characteristic is most prominent in the nitrogen annealed samples. The behavior of electric-field factor beta was investigated for variations in nitride thickness. From these results it is concluded that nitride-dominant ONO film is better for long-term reliability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/36338/","conferenceDate":"11-13 April 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Apr 1989","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3462550","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Long term reliability of SiO/sub 2//SiN/SiO/sub 2/ thin layer insulator formed in 9 mu m deep trench on high boron concentrated silicon","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long term reliability of SiO/sub 2//SiN/SiO/sub 2/ thin layer insulator formed in 9 mu m deep trench on high boron concentrated silicon","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00036338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051795S","chronDate":"11-13 Apr 1989","isNumber":"1515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"797","citationCount":"1","articleId":"36338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":36349,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The effect of signal asymmetry, duty cycle and frequency on the damage generation rate has been tested. The data suggests that the equivalent DC current of a non-DC signal is given by the average of the signal current for frequencies 1 kHz and higher. A transition region from an average DC equivalent circuit model to an ON-time equivalent type model has been identified around 1 Hz for PDC signals at 3.3E6 A/cm/sup 2/ and 200 degrees C. The refilling of microvoids under current reversal prevents the observation of that transition region for symmetrical bidirectional currents. PDC signals are shown to behave as particular cases of a generalized bidirectional signal. A physical model of the kinetics of material accumulation/depletion is described to show that a high-frequency operation approximation naturally leads to the average DC equivalent-current model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELPHY.1989.36349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1515","startPage":"220","endPage":"228","displayPublicationTitle":"27th Annual Proceedings., International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/797/1515/00036349.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of electromigration under bidirectional (BC) and pulsed unidirectional (PDC) currents","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/36349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Apr 1989","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of electromigration under bidirectional (BC) and pulsed unidirectional (PDC) currents","conferenceDate":"11-13 April 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3462561","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of electromigration under bidirectional (BC) and pulsed unidirectional (PDC) currents","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00036349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0269S","chronDate":"11-13 Apr 1989","isNumber":"1515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"797","citationCount":"42","articleId":"36349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":36683,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.L.

For example, decisions must be made relative to data rates, the number of data channels and whether to use raw data, or preprocessed data in the form of spike parameters. The second is the selection of the neural network architecture and the specific implementation of that architecture. For example, choices must be made between supervised and unsupervised learning schemes, and among the many available network learning algorithms.

The authors present a comparison algorithm that is O(nlog n) on the length, n, of the longer sequence. This algorithm uses techniques developed for rapid comparison of two discrete signals, in particular, cross-correlation using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The authors treat the DNA as a discrete signal with each nucleotide base represented by a single point in the signal. There are only four possible values that the signal can assume which they represent by one of four complex numbers. The comparison is made by performing a cross correlation between one signal and the complex conjugate of the other. Any significant peak in the resulting signal indicates a strong similarity between the two sequences. The authors present the results of comparison of two strains of the human immunodeficiency virus and of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses. Their results suggest that this technique is a powerful method for comparing very long sequences of DNA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/812/1518/00036756.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference","doi":"10.1109/NEBC.1989.36756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEBC.1989.36756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=36756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using signal processing techniques for DNA sequence comparison","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","DNA","Sequences","Signal processing algorithms","Humans","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Fourier transforms","Fast Fourier transforms","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNA","molecular biophysics","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simian immunodeficiency virus","signal processing techniques","DNA sequence comparison","comparison algorithm","fast Fourier transform","nucleotide base","complex numbers","cross correlation","human immunodeficiency virus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/36756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Mar 1989","displayDocTitle":"Using signal processing techniques for DNA sequence comparison","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3485064","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"27-28 March 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using signal processing techniques for DNA sequence comparison","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00036756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032278S","chronDate":"27-28 Mar 1989","isNumber":"1518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"812","citationCount":"13","articleId":"36756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":36850,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

Results are expressed in terms of the mean values and variances of the measured parameters. Computer simulation results, based on Gaussian jitter show the changes of amplitude and phase standard deviations versus the changes of jitter standard deviation and signal amplitude for different numbers of samples, N. It is shown that amplitude and phase standard deviations are inversely proportional to square root N, and proportional to sigma /sub R/, the standard deviation of phase noise (jitter). This dependence on sigma /sub R/ means proportionality to both signal frequency and time jitter standard deviation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Jitter","Phase measurement","Apertures","Random variables","Communication standards","Frequency measurement","Instruments","Delay effects","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","computerised signal processing","data acquisition","data analysis","digital simulation","fast Fourier transforms","random noise","statistical analysis","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude measurement","phase measurement","computer simulation","sampling jitter","sinewave measurements","sinusoidal signal","FFT","data acquisition","mean values","variances","Gaussian jitter","standard deviations","phase noise","signal frequency","time jitter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1989.36850","publicationTitle":"6th IEEE Conference Record., Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"6th IEEE Conference Record., Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/818/1520/00036850.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1989.36850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of sampling jitter on some sinewave measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=36850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of sampling jitter on some sinewave measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/36850/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3495190","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Apr 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of sampling jitter on some sinewave measurements","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00036850.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026808S","chronDate":"25-27 Apr 1989","isNumber":"1520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"818","citationCount":"1","articleId":"36850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":36851,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

One obvious application of this algorithm is to feed these estimates back to adjustable delay units in all the sampling paths to compensate the sampling time offsets.

The design avoids the need for a single low-resistance current-sensing resistor and the attendant problems inherent in such resistors. A prototype of the cell-based transconductance amplifier was implemented with ten positive and ten negative current cells to gain some experimental familiarity with the approach and provide verification of computer simulation results. The prototype transconductance amplifier is DC coupled, has a 3-dB bandwidth of about 750 kHz, and can deliver up to 35 A RMS (root mean square) at 100 kHz with an output voltage of 5 V RMS.

The devices tested exhibit a cubic relationship between the maximum avalanche current and inductance, which represents a nonconstant energy capability. This maximum current decreases linearly with initial junction temperature, indicating a thermally initiated failure mechanism. The maximum junction temperature at failure was found to be 400-450 degrees C. The power-supply voltage reduces the maximum avalanche current by increasing the time in avalanche. The current capability is also proportional to total die area when the avalanche time is constant.

The system delivers 1 kW to a regulated 40 V distribution bus from the rectified utility line. Its switching frequency is 500 kHz, and it uses a phase-shifted pulse-width modulation technique to avoid primary-side switching losses. The converter's topology is a standard power MOSFET H-bridge that drives a transformer. The output of this transformer is rectified by a full bridge of Schottky diodes. The switches of this forward converter are operated in a fixed-frequency PWM mode. The dominant parasitic elements are the transformer's leakage inductor, the MOSFETs' output capacitors, and the rectifiers' junction capacitors. Of these three groups of parasitic elements, only the leakage inductors do not result in a direct switching loss. To avoid MOSFET switching losses, the converter is controlled with a special gate-drive pattern that permits full recovery of the MOSFETs' capacitive energy. At the same time this drive scheme gives zero-voltage switching for the MOSFETs. The converter's efficiency at full load approaches 90%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/36994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Mar 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3484826","conferenceDate":"13-17 March 1989","displayDocTitle":"A 1 kW, 500 kHz front-end converter for a distributed power supply system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1 kW, 500 kHz front-end converter for a distributed power supply system","confLoc":"Baltimore, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"00036994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024304S","chronDate":"13-17 Mar 1989","isNumber":"1522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"821","citationCount":"104","articleId":"36994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":37169,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The design is essentially a transverse electromagnetic cell (TEM-cell) anechoic-chamber hybrid. A steady input power generates an almost constant field (better than +/-4 dB) anywhere in the recommended test volume from DC to frequencies exceeding 1 GHz. Susceptibility testing is done as in a normal TEM cell. Emission testing models test object radiation as due to an equivalent set of multipoles (in essence electric and magnetic dipoles). The multipole components are determined through a sequence of measurements. Once found, the multipole model can be used to predict test object radiation both in an ideal free space and above a perfect ground screen. In this manner time-consuming emission measurements, such as those required by FCC Rules Part 15 Subpart J or VDE 0871, can be simulated numerically.

The amplifier shows >13 dB gain across the frequency band using a chip area of only 1.9 mm*2.1 mm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.1989.37281","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00037281.png","publicationTitle":"Digest of Papers.,Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Monolithic Circuits Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Papers.,Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Monolithic Circuits Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/839/1526/00037281.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"147","doi":"10.1109/MCS.1989.37281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel 4-18 GHz monolithic matrix distributed amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 June 1989","displayDocTitle":"A novel 4-18 GHz monolithic matrix distributed amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-13 June 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3484963","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/37281/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel 4-18 GHz monolithic matrix distributed amplifier","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00037281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028531S","chronDate":"12-13 June 1989","isNumber":"1526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"839","citationCount":"4","articleId":"37281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":37342,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The network utilized is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier with one hidden layer. Backpropagation learning is used for its training. The image is represented by rotation-invariant features which are the magnitudes of the Zernike moments of the image. To achieve translation and scale invariancy, the image is first normalized with respect to these two parameters using its geometrical moments. The performance of the NN classifier on a database consisting of binary images of all English characters is reported and compared to those of nearest-neighbor and minimum-mean-distance classifiers. The results show that: (1) the MLP outperforms the other two classifiers, especially when noise is present; (2) the nearest-neighbor classifier performs about the same as the NN for the noiseless case; and (3) the Zernike-moment-based features possess strong class separability power.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1989.37850","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00037850.png","startPage":"200","endPage":"205","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR '89: IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/247/1531/00037850.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR '89: IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1989.37850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object recognition using a neural network and invariant Zernike features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object recognition","Neural networks","Biological neural networks","Image analysis","Multilayer perceptrons","Pattern recognition","Redundancy","Feature extraction","Polynomials","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation learning","neighbourhood concept","pattern recognition","learning systems","neural network","invariant Zernike features","multilayer perceptron","rotation-invariant features","scale invariancy","binary images","minimum-mean-distance classifiers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/37850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Object recognition using a neural network and invariant Zernike features","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-8 June 1989","accessionNumber":"3484874","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object recognition using a neural network and invariant Zernike features","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00037850.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03866S","chronDate":"4-8 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"247","citationCount":"11","articleId":"37850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":37858,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These models can be used to classify nonrigid shapes, even if they are partially occluded, and to label their parts. The representation of a single shape is a layered graph whose vertices correspond to n-ary relations. A class of shapes is represented as a probability model whose outcome is a graph. The method is based on two types of learning: unsupervised learning used to discover relations, and supervised learning used to build class models. The class models are constructed incrementally, by matching and merging graphs representing shape instances. This process uses a fast graph-matching heuristic which seeks a simplest representation of a graph. An important feature is the self-generation of symbolic primitives by an unsupervised learning process. This feature makes it possible to apply the system to any set of shape data without adjustments, while other methods might require the user to provide a different set of primitives for each case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR '89: IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings CVPR '89: IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel2/247/1531/00037907.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model learning and recognition of nonrigid objects","doi":"10.1109/CVPR.1989.37907","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00037907.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.1989.37907","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=37907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/37907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Jun 1989","displayDocTitle":"Model learning and recognition of nonrigid objects","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3471690","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 June 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model learning and recognition of nonrigid objects","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00037907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055489S","chronDate":"4-8 Jun 1989","isNumber":"1531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"247","citationCount":"17","articleId":"37907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":37908,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The authors develop mathematical tools for estimating quantization error in hexagonal sensory configurations. These include analytic expressions for the average error and the error distribution of a function of an arbitrarily large number of hexagonally quantized variables. The two quantities (the average error and the error distribution) are essential in assessing the reliability of a given algorithm. The corresponding expressions for square spatial sampling are presented for comparison; they can be used to determine which sampling technique would result in less quantization error for a particular algorithm. Such a comparison is important due to the paramount role that quantization error plays in computational approaches to computer vision.

The transient discharge current is the same as the charge current remaining after subtracting the leakage current. Unlike ordinary charging and discharging processes, anomalous behavior was observed for copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene with varied comonomer content in which a current peak took place in a discharge process. The time taken for the current peak to appear is shorter the higher the temperature. This unusual discharging occurred at temperatures above the ferroelectric transition and was considerably suppressed in electrodialysed samples with less ionic impurity content. Thus the anomalous discharge process is most likely connected with a retarded discharge of ionic charge bound in the paraelectric phase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISE.1988.38545","publicationTitle":"6th International Symposium on Electrets,(ISE 6) Proceedings.","displayPublicationTitle":"6th International Symposium on Electrets,(ISE 6) Proceedings.","pdfPath":"/iel4/745/1535/00038545.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISE.1988.38545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous discharge current in copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=38545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sep 1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/38545/","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous discharge current in copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1988","accessionNumber":"3428210","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous discharge current in copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and trifluoroethylene","confLoc":"Oxford, UK","sourcePdf":"00038545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029912S","chronDate":"1-3 Sep 1988","isNumber":"1535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"745","articleId":"38545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":38681,"authors":[{"name":"I.

These MMICs illustrate the capability of silicon bipolar technology to offer cost-effective solutions for microwave applications up to 6 GHz and for digital lightwave applications up to 5 Gb/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1989.38681","startPage":"109","publicationTitle":"IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/825/1537/00038681.pdf","endPage":"112 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1989.38681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"13-15 June 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/38681/","displayDocTitle":"Silicon bipolar fixed and variable gain amplifier MMICs for microwave and lightwave applications up to 6 GHz","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3484139","publicationDate":"1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon bipolar fixed and variable gain amplifier MMICs for microwave and lightwave applications up to 6 GHz","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00038681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028563S","chronDate":"13-15 June 1989","isNumber":"1537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"825","citationCount":"28","articleId":"38681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":38701,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The mixer downconverts the 92-96-GHz RF to a 8-12-GHz IF (intermediate frequency). At 4-dBm LO (local oscillator) drive, the mixer showed 5.8-dB conversion loss, 12.4-dB noise figure, and -3.2-dBm input power at the 1-dB gain compression point. The HEMT mixer is suitable for a 94-GHz missile seeker application where available W-band LO power is extremely low. The HEMT mixer can be monolithically integrated with a HEMT low-noise amplifier to form a low-cost, small-size, and low-weight receiver front end for use in millimeter-wave smart munitions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSYM.1989.38828","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00038828.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/825/1537/00038828.pdf","startPage":"731","endPage":"734 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/MWSYM.1989.38828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and performance of a 94 GHz HEMT mixer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 1989","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of a 94 GHz HEMT mixer","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 June 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3484266","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/38828/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of a 94 GHz HEMT mixer","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00038828.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033933S","chronDate":"13-15 June 1989","isNumber":"1537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"825","citationCount":"15","articleId":"38828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":38829,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

Experimental results are also presented for a three-stage, 2-W C-band amplifier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/38879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 June 1989","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 June 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3484313","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A technique for the maintenance of FET power amplifier efficiency under backoff","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A technique for the maintenance of FET power amplifier efficiency under backoff","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00038879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025884S","chronDate":"13-15 June 1989","isNumber":"1537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"825","citationCount":"12","articleId":"38879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":38887,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

The effects of losses on the high-frequency performance are investigated numerically using detailed MESFET models. Further simulations show how impedance tapering, forward-feed capacitors, and series-drain inductors can be used together to overcome the high-frequency losses, thereby maximizing the bandwidth. The approach is illustrated by the design and fabrication of a DA with a predicted gain of 6.9+or-0.7 dB over a bandwidth of 1-12 GHz.

Another major aspect of this methodology is that there is no limitation on the degree of modeling of the power system being studied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICA.1989.38976","publicationTitle":"Conference Papers Power Industry Computer Application Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Papers Power Industry Computer Application Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/835/1538/00038976.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"82","doi":"10.1109/PICA.1989.38976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of suitable locations for power system stabilizers and static VAr compensators for damping electromechanical oscillations in large scale power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Determination of suitable locations for power system stabilizers and static VAr compensators for damping electromechanical oscillations in large scale power systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1989","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3452142","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/38976/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of suitable locations for power system stabilizers and static VAr compensators for damping electromechanical oscillations in large scale power systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00038976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034177S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1989","isNumber":"1538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"835","citationCount":"34","articleId":"38976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":38979,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The development of the solution method is based on the Lagrangian relaxation approach. The demand and reserve constraints, the minimum up and down time constraints, the fuel utilization constraints, and the hydro constraints are all considered in the problem formulation. The proposed procedure is especially applicable to systems whose unit commitment solution is sensitive to changes in the Lagrangian multipliers. In this regard, the proposed method incorporates the following special features. First, a set of upper bounds is added to limit the excess in the spinning reserves at different periods during the search for a feasible suboptimal solution. Second, a revised economic dispatch algorithm is introduced in the final stage of the method. This algorithm identifies unnecessarily committed units in the generation schedule of a large power network and provides the solutions for the economic allocation of the system demand among the committed units.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/38994/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3440237","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"1-5 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An innovative approach to generation scheduling in large-scale hydro-thermal power systems with fuel constrained units","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An innovative approach to generation scheduling in large-scale hydro-thermal power systems with fuel constrained units","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00038994.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045657S","chronDate":"1-5 May 1989","isNumber":"1538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"835","citationCount":"10","articleId":"38994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":39002,"authors":[{"name":"E.H.P.

When there is missing alarm data, and if such missing data will not result in an alarm combination identical to one associated with another system problem, the experimental IAP successfully makes the right guess.

A novel technique, known as adaptive sampling, for high-precision phase measurement is introduced. A digital signal-processing approach is used in this technique. The maximum sampling rate required for this technique is h+2 samples/cycle of the input signals, i.e. (h+2)f sampless, where h, is the highest harmonic present in the signals and f is the fundamental frequency of the signals. This sampling rate is way below the Nyquist sampling rate (more than 2hf samples/s) when h is a large number. In the adaptive sampling technique the sampling rate is started from three samples/cycle and then is gradually increased until the phase is correctly measured. This phase measurement technique has been verified using synthesized signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase measurement","Sampling methods","Signal sampling","Distortion measurement","Time measurement","Phase distortion","Harmonic distortion","Frequency","Pulse measurements","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","computerised signal processing","harmonics","phase measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase measurement","adaptive sampling","harmonics","digital signal-processing","sampling rate","synthesized signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/19.39036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/1539/00039036.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.39036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High precision phase measurement using adaptive sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=39036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High precision phase measurement using adaptive sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/39036/","volume":"38","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"3572176","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High precision phase measurement using adaptive sampling","sourcePdf":"00039036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032883S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"34","articleId":"39036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":39064,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Cirit","affiliation":["Adaptec Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Cirit","id":"37946467200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"39064","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":923},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=39064","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Capacitance","Circuit simulation","Predictive models","Computer simulation","Mathematical model","SPICE","Computational modeling","Circuit testing","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitance","digital simulation","electric charge","electronic engineering computing","equivalent circuits","insulated gate field effect transistors","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge conservation","MOSFET","Meyer model","computer simulation","capacitance effects","MOS transistors","charge nonconservation","capacitive nonlinearities","SPICE","circuit simulator","mathematical model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/43.39064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/1541/00039064.pdf","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.39064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Meyer model revisited: why is charge not conserved?

This logic-level implementation is guaranteed to be testable for all single stuck-at faults in the combinational logic and the test sequences for these faults can be obtained using combinational test generation techniques alone. The sequential machine is assumed to have a reset state and be R-reachable. All single stuck-at faults in the combinational logic and the input and output stuck-at faults of the memory elements in the synthesized logic-level automaton can be tested without access to the memory elements using these test sequences. Thus this procedure represents an alternative to a scan design methodology. The area penalty incurred due to the constraints on the optimization are small. The performance of the synthesized design is usually better than that of an unconstrained design optimized for area alone. The authors show that an intimate relationship exists between state assignment and the testability of a sequential machine. They propose a procedure of constrained state assignment and logic optimization which guarantees testability for both Moore and Mealy machines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.39071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/1541/00039071.pdf","startPage":"1100","endPage":"1107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.39071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A synthesis and optimization procedure for fully and easily testable sequential machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/39071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1989","displayDocTitle":"A synthesis and optimization procedure for fully and easily testable sequential machines","volume":"8","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1989","accessionNumber":"3547831","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A synthesis and optimization procedure for fully and easily testable sequential machines","sourcePdf":"00039071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049396S","chronDate":"Oct 1989","isNumber":"1541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"65","articleId":"39071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":39072,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-L.

Each set in the system must be provided with audio and video programming and the electrical power necessary to operate the set. Distribution of programming and power to the sets with a connector for each set would cause reliability and maintenance problems and hinder timely cabin reconfiguration. The entertainment sets can receive audio and video signals through radio-frequency transmission, but distributing power to the sets without using connectors requires a novel approach. The analysis, design, and construction of a prototype connectorless power supply that inductively couples power to the entertainment sets across an air gap is described. An equivalent-circuit model of the supply is developed, and laboratory measurements performed on the prototype are discussed. The prototype unit is shown to be a practical implementation that meets all design requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/1544/00039124.pdf","startPage":"348","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/63.39124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.39124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=1544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=39124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectorless power supply for an aircraft-passenger entertainment system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power supplies","Aircraft","Prototypes","Connectors","Performance evaluation","Leg","Floors","Power system reliability","Maintenance","RF signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equivalent circuits","power supplies to apparatus"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductive power coupling","audio programming","aircraft-passenger entertainment system","video entertainment sets","video programming","electrical power","transmission","connectorless power supply","equivalent-circuit model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/39124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1989","displayDocTitle":"Connectorless power supply for an aircraft-passenger entertainment system","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","accessionNumber":"3563323","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectorless power supply for an aircraft-passenger entertainment system","sourcePdf":"00039124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021558S","chronDate":"July  1989","isNumber":"1544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"64","articleId":"39124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":39193,"authors":[{"name":"Z.
