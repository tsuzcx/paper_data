To achieve robustness and accuracy in difficult scenarios, probabilistic estimation techniques are needed to compensate for the errors in the detection of lane-delimiting features. This paper presents a solution for lane estimation in difficult scenarios based on the particle-filtering framework. The solution employs a novel technique for pitch detection based on the fusion of two stereovision-based cues, a novel method for particle measurement and weighing using multiple lane-delimiting cues extracted by grayscale and stereo data processing, and a novel method for deciding upon the validity of the lane-estimation results. Initialization samples are used for uniform handling of the road discontinuities, eliminating the need for explicit track initialization. The resulting solution has proven to be a reliable and fast lane detector for difficult scenarios.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5038838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5038838/04895220.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2009.2018328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2009.2018328","startPage":"272","endPage":"282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Lane Tracking in Difficult Road Scenarios Using Stereovision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895220/","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Lane Tracking in Difficult Road Scenarios Using Stereovision","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895220/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10712626","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Lane Tracking in Difficult Road Scenarios Using Stereovision","sourcePdf":"tits-danescu-2018328.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054436S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5038838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5038838","articleId":"4895220","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4895226,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed N.

This is normally done by adding gateways which serve to increase the backhaul capacity of the network. In this paper we consider adding capacity in this manner using free-space optical (FSO) backhaul links. To accomplish this, we formulate a joint clustering and gateway placement problem which includes the strong rate-distance dependence of practical FSO links. The formulation incorporates the positions of existing wireline gateways and minimizes the number of additional hybrid-FSO/RF gateways which are needed to satisfy the target capacity requirements. After showing the complexity of the problem, a solution that is motivated by genetic algorithms is proposed. The performance of our algorithm is then compared to an optimal solution generated via an integer linear program (ILP) for small WMNs. The proposed algorithm is then modified to allow for balancing the traffic load that is carried by each gateway in the WMN. Many scenarios are considered which demonstrate the value of using FSO backhaul links to obtain post-deployment capacity upgrades in response to changes in user traffic.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2014910","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5153550/04895226.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2014910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153550","startPage":"2688","endPage":"2697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-Space Optical Gateway Placement in Hybrid Wireless Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Free-Space Optical Gateway Placement in Hybrid Wireless Mesh Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"July15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"14","publicationDate":"July15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10811876","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895226/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Free-Space Optical Gateway Placement in Hybrid Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"27jlt06-shranilovic-2014910.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129504S","chronDate":"July15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5153550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5153550","articleId":"4895226","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895228,"authors":[{"name":"John A.

The architecture also benefits from the use of the co-channel interference canceller. In contrast to wavelength-division multiple-access (WDMA), a fewer set of wavelengths are needed as a result of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M-ary</i>\n source coding. As the spreading codes, double-padded modified prime codes (DPMPC) have been employed. The performance has been analyzed in terms of the users' channel utilization in the network and compared with common incoherent pulse-position modulation technique. The results indicate that this architecture is very power efficient and enhances the network capacity. With the advantage of shorter code length, DPMPC also improves the throughput. It is shown that for a maximum bit-rate, the network performance can be improved by reducing the channel utilization. Since each IP packet is buffered only at the edge of this network, the buffer delay is considerably reduced. The novel encoder adjusting time management reduces the switching time notably rather than traditional routing. Our analytical investigation clearly indicates that this OCDMA technique can be an excellent candidate for the future ultra-fast high bit-rate optical IP networks.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2016581","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5196856/04895236.pdf","startPage":"3845","endPage":"3852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2016581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5196856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IP Routing and Transmission Analysis in Optical CDMA Networks: Coherent Modulation With Incoherent Demodulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895236/","displayDocTitle":"IP Routing and Transmission Analysis in Optical CDMA Networks: Coherent Modulation With Incoherent Demodulation","volume":"27","issue":"17","publicationDate":"Sept.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10836759","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895236/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IP Routing and Transmission Analysis in Optical CDMA Networks: Coherent Modulation With Incoherent Demodulation","sourcePdf":"jlt-ghafouri-shiraz-2016581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098138S","chronDate":"Sept.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5196856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5196856","articleId":"4895236","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895239,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Bandiera","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Innovazione, Universit\u00e0 del Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5200771/4895239/4895239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Bandiera (M'01) was born in Maglie, Lecce, Italy, on March 9, 1974.

At the design stage we resort to the two-step GLRT-based design procedure; to this end, we assume that a set of training data is available, namely data free of signal components, but sharing the same Gaussian distribution of the noise in the cells under test. Remarkably, proposed detectors possess the CFAR property under the noise-only hypothesis. The performance assessment, conducted by Monte Carlo simulation, is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of proposed solutions, also in comparison to existing ones.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2021707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5200771/04895239.pdf","startPage":"3305","endPage":"3316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2021707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CFAR Detection Strategies for Distributed Targets Under Conic Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895239/","displayDocTitle":"CFAR Detection Strategies for Distributed Targets Under Conic Constraints","volume":"57","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816673","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895239/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CFAR Detection Strategies for Distributed Targets Under Conic Constraints","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-gricci-2021707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154677S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5200771","articleId":"4895239","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895241,"authors":[{"name":"Azad M.

The implemented controller is based on Actel Fusion field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The objective of this paper is to evaluate the ability of the proposed fully integrated solution to ensure all the required performances in such applications, particularly in terms of control quality and time/area performances. To this purpose, a current control algorithm of a permanent-magnet synchronous machine has been implemented. This machine is associated with a resolver position sensor. In addition to the current control closed loop, all the necessary motor control tasks are implemented in the same device. The analog-to-digital conversion is ensured by the integrated analog-to-digital converter (ADC), avoiding the use of external converters. The resolver processing unit, which computes the rotor position and speed from the resolver signals, is implemented in the FPGA matrix, avoiding the use of external resolver-to-digital converter (RDC). The sine patterns used for the Park transformation are stored in the integrated flash memory blocks.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2021591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2021591","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/04895244.pdf","startPage":"4006","endPage":"4017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Fully Integrated FPGA-Based Controller for Synchronous Motor Drive","volume":"56","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10869403","htmlLink":"/document/4895244/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Integrated FPGA-Based Controller for Synchronous Motor Drive","sourcePdf":"tie-idkhajine-2021591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073855S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"4895244","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895247,"authors":[{"name":"Juha Pyrhonen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical Drives Technology, Department of Electrical Engineering, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Lappeeranta, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5352216/4895247/4895247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juha Pyrh\u00f6nen (M'06) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering, the Licentiate of Science (Technology) degree, and the D.Sc.

A user in the MC scheme transmits several codes at the same time to represent the transmission of several data bit ones. The number of parallel codes transmitted at a time is proportional to the user's bit rate and the number of data bit ones. While the MK scheme only transmits one code at a time, each code represents a symbol and each transmitted symbol represents multiple data bits. Data rate is varied by changing the symbol size, which, in turn, changes the number of data bits per baud, similar to MODEM communications. In this paper, the spectral efficiencies (SEs) of these two asynchronous schemes are derived for the comparison of their performances and efficiencies as a whole. The SE of the conventional single-rate on-off-keying (OOK) O-CDMA scheme is also derived for a baseline comparison. Our numerical results show that the MC scheme always has a better SE than the single-rate OOK scheme, while the MK scheme can have a better SE than the single-rate OOK scheme under certain conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5153550/04895249.pdf","startPage":"2771","endPage":"2778","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2016675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2016675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5153550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Efficiency Study of Two Multirate Schemes for Asynchronous Optical CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bit rate","Optical network units","Multimedia systems","Modems","Councils","Java","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral efficiency","multirate schemes","asynchronous optical CDMA","multiple-code","multicode-keying","multimedia services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicode keying","on-off keying","optical code division multiple access","spectral efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July15,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Efficiency Study of Two Multirate Schemes for Asynchronous Optical CDMA","volume":"27","issue":"14","htmlLink":"/document/4895249/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10824013","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Efficiency Study of Two Multirate Schemes for Asynchronous Optical CDMA","sourcePdf":"jlt-yang-2016675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080816S","chronDate":"July15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5153550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5153550","articleId":"4895249","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895251,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Yang","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4976157/4895251/4895251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao Yang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Michigan State University, East Lansing, in 2008.","His research focus is the analog/mixed-signal integrated-circuit design for the biomedical and biochemical instrumentation microsystem.

This paper introduces a microsystem platform that enables multiple bioelectrochemical interfaces to be interrogated simultaneously by an onchip amperometric readout system. A post-complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication procedure is described that permits the formation of planar electrode arrays and self assembly of biosensor interfaces on the electrodes. The onchip, 0.5-mum CMOS readout electronics include a compact potentiostat that supports a very broad range of input currents-6 pA to 10 muA-to accommodate diverse biosensor interfaces. The 2.3 times 2.2-mm chip operates from a 5-V supply at 0.6 mA. A prototype electrochemical sensor platform, including an onchip potentiostat and miniaturized biosensor array, was characterized by using cyclic voltammetry. The linear relationship between the oxidization peak values and the concentrations of target analytes in the solution verifies functionality of the system and demonstrates the potential for future implementations of this platform in high sensitivity, low cost, and onchip protein-based sensor arrays.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/4976157/04895251.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2015650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2009.2015650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4976157","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amperometric Electrochemical Microsystem for a Miniaturized Protein Biosensor Array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Biosensors","Sensor arrays","Electrodes","Sensor phenomena and characterization","MOS devices","Fabrication","Readout electronics","Prototypes","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amperometric sensors","bioelectric phenomena","bioMEMS","biosensors","CMOS integrated circuits","proteomics","voltammetry (chemical analysis)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amperometric electrochemical microsystem","miniaturized protein biosensor array","protein based bioelectrochemical interfaces","microsystem platform","on chip amperometric readout system","post CMOS fabrication procedure","complementary metal oxide semiconductor","planar electrode array formation","biosensor interface self assembly","CMOS readout electronics","on chip potentiostat","cyclic voltammetry","size 0.5 mum","current 6 pA to 10 muA","size 2.3 mm","size 2.2 mm","voltage 5 V","current 0.6 mA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amperometric readout","bioelectronic sensor","biosensor array","complementary metal\u2013oxide semiconductor (CMOS) potentiostat","electrochemical sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Amperometric Electrochemical Microsystem for a Miniaturized Protein Biosensor Array","volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4895251/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10666063","pubMedId":"23853217","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amperometric Electrochemical Microsystem for a Miniaturized Protein Biosensor Array","sourcePdf":"tbcas-yang-2015650.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092069S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"4976157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4976157","articleId":"4895251","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895264,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Arici","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Tarik Arici received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering in 2000 from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2003 and 2009, respectively.","He is a research engineer in the Video Software Group at NVIDIA.

In this framework, contrast enhancement is posed as an optimization problem that minimizes a cost function. Histogram equalization is an effective technique for contrast enhancement. However, a conventional histogram equalization (HE) usually results in excessive contrast enhancement, which in turn gives the processed image an unnatural look and creates visual artifacts. By introducing specifically designed penalty terms, the level of contrast enhancement can be adjusted; noise robustness, white/black stretching and mean-brightness preservation may easily be incorporated into the optimization. Analytic solutions for some of the important criteria are presented. Finally, a low-complexity algorithm for contrast enhancement is presented, and its performance is demonstrated against a recently proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2021548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5200729/04895264.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2021548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200729","startPage":"1921","endPage":"1935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Histogram Modification Framework and Its Application for Image Contrast Enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Histogram Modification Framework and Its Application for Image Contrast Enhancement","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816682","pubMedId":"19403363","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895264/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Histogram Modification Framework and Its Application for Image Contrast Enhancement","sourcePdf":"18tip08-sdikbas-2021548.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079235S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5200729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"489","xplore-issue":"5200729","articleId":"4895264","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895266,"authors":[{"name":"Javed Asghar","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/4976142/4895266/4895266-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ian Hood Professional Engineer and Cisco Senior Product Marketing Manager, is responsible for driving the global market expansion of Cisco Carrier Ethernet and IPTV/Quad Play solutions based on the Cisco IP Next-Generation Network (NGN) architecture.

Delivering consistent QoE in packet-switched networks can be a complex proposition due to the high sensitivity of video traffic to packet loss, as well as to delay and jitter. Preserving video quality in IP Television (IPTV) networks that mostly rely on copper access lines poses an even greater challenge. Service providers need intelligent mechanisms in core and distribution networks to prevent congestion that deteriorates video quality, as well as intelligence between the aggregation networks and IP set-top box (STB) to repair packet losses, speed up channel change times and monitor the quality of the subscriber experience. This paper discusses a series of core and aggregation-layer approaches, collectively referred to as Visual Quality of Experience (VQE) to address these issues. The VQE approach encompasses on-path video connection admission control (CAC) employing Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) in the core and aggregation layers, and a real-time signaling mechanism operating between the provider aggregation edge and the IP STBs to address packet losses, long channel change times and quality monitoring.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10666128","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4895266/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Preserving Video Quality in IPTV Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preserving Video Quality in IPTV Networks","sourcePdf":"tbc-hood-2019419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039544S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4976142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4976142","articleId":"4895266","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4895275,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Sanchez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Victor Sanchez (S'05) received the Bachelor's degree (with distinction) in electronics and telecommunications from the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM), Monterrey, Mexico, in 1999, and the Master's degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2002.

Quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed technique significantly outperforms current state of the art with an average compression ratio improvement of 13%.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2009.2021159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5156189/04895275.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2021159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5156189","startPage":"645","endPage":"655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Lossless fMRI Image Compression Based on Motion Compensation and Customized Entropy Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel Lossless fMRI Image Compression Based on Motion Compensation and Customized Entropy Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895275/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10773242","pubMedId":"19403369","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895275/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Lossless fMRI Image Compression Based on Motion Compensation and Customized Entropy Coding","sourcePdf":"titb-sanchez-2021159.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110879S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5156189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5156189","articleId":"4895275","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895279,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Tandra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4919177/4895279/4895279-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rahul Tandra received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, in 2003 and the M.S. degree from the University of California (UC), Berkeley, in 2005, both in electrical engineering.

Such revolutionary and transforming technology represents a paradigm shift in the design of wireless systems, as it will allow the agile and efficient utilization of the radio spectrum by offering distributed terminals or radio cells the ability of radio sensing, self-adaptation, and dynamic spectrum sharing. Cooperative communications and networking is another new communication technology paradigm that allows distributed terminals in a wireless network to collaborate through some distributed transmission or signal processing so as to realize a new form of space diversity to combat the detrimental effects of fading channels. In this paper, we consider the application of these technologies to spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing. One of the most important challenges for cognitive radio systems is to identify the presence of primary (licensed) users over a wide range of spectrum at a particular time and specific geographic location. We consider the use of cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems to enhance the reliability of detecting primary users. We shall describe spectrum sensing for cognitive radios and propose robust cooperative spectrum sensing techniques for a practical framework employing cognitive radios. We also investigate cooperative communications for spectrum sharing in a cognitive wireless relay network. To exploit the maximum spectrum opportunities, we present a cognitive space-time-frequency coding technique that can opportunistically adjust its coding structure by adapting itself to the dynamic spectrum environment.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2015716","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4919177/04895282.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2015716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4919177","startPage":"878","endPage":"893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Communications for Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895282","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Communications for Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895282/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"97","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10665032","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895282/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Communications for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"jproc-letaief-2015716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10861S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4919177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"817","xplore-issue":"4919177","articleId":"4895282","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895289,"authors":[{"name":"Seshadri Kolluri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Seshadri","lastName":"Kolluri","id":"37604776100"},{"name":"Yi Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Pei","id":"37401137000"},{"name":"Stacia Keller","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Stacia","lastName":"Keller","id":"37270264200"},{"name":"Steven P.

A nano-CMOS current-starved voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) circuit has been designed using this flow as a case study. The oscillation frequency is considered as the objective optimization function with the area overhead as constraint. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out on the parasitic extracted netlist of the VCO to study the effect of process variation on the oscillation frequency. In the design cycle, a performance degradation of 43.5% is observed when the parasitic extracted netlist is subjected to worst-case process variation. The proposed design flow could bring the oscillation frequency within 4.5% of the target, leading to convergence of the complete design in only one design iteration. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper presents the first work focussed on a current starved VCO in which the combined effect of parasitics and process variations has been considered.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2002046","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5208586/04895291.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1342","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2002046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Parasitic and Process-Variation Aware Nano-CMOS RF Circuits: A VCO Case Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of Parasitic and Process-Variation Aware Nano-CMOS RF Circuits: A VCO Case Study","volume":"17","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10828388","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895291/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Parasitic and Process-Variation Aware Nano-CMOS RF Circuits: A VCO Case Study","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ghai-2002046.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061246S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5208586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5208586","articleId":"4895291","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4895296,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Salomonsson","affiliation":["Electric Power Systems Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5109837/4895296/4895296-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Salomonsson (S'02) received the M.Sc. and Tech.

The LV DC microgrid is used to interconnect distributed resources and sensitive electronic loads. When designing an LV DC microgrid protection system, knowledge from existing DC power systems can be used. However, in most cases, these systems use grid-connected rectifiers with current-limiting capability during DC faults. In contrast, an LV DC microgrid must be connected to an AC grid through converters with bidirectional power flow and, therefore, a different protection-system design is needed. In this paper, the operating principles and technical data of LV DC protection devices, both available and in the research stage, are presented. Furthermore, different fault-detection and grounding methods are discussed. The influence of the selected protection devices and grounding method on an LV DC microgrid is studied through simulations. The results show that it is possible to use available devices to protect such a system. Problems may arise with high-impedance ground faults which can be difficult to detect.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2016622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2016622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5109837/04895296.pdf","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protection of Low-Voltage DC Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Protection of Low-Voltage DC Microgrids","volume":"24","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895296/","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10731614","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895296/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protection of Low-Voltage DC Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-salomonsson-2016622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076776S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5109837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"449","xplore-issue":"5109837","articleId":"4895296","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":4895304,"authors":[{"name":"Douglas B.

For SAR systems mounted on a UAV, the motion errors can be considerably high due to atmospheric turbulence and aircraft properties, such as its small size, which makes motion compensation (MOCO) in UAV SAR more urgent than other SAR systems. In this paper, based on 3-D motion error analysis, a novel 3-D MOCO method is proposed. The main idea is to extract necessary motion parameters, i.e., forward velocity and displacement in line-of-sight direction, from radar raw data, based on an instantaneous Doppler rate estimate. Experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for low- or medium-altitude UAV SAR systems equipped with a low-accuracy inertial navigation system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5165150/04895307.pdf","startPage":"2870","endPage":"2883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2015657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2015657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165150","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Compensation for UAV SAR Based on Raw Radar Data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Synthetic aperture radar","Aircraft","Motion analysis","Error analysis","Data mining","Doppler radar","Motion estimation","Inertial navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error analysis","geophysical techniques","inertial navigation","motion compensation","radar imaging","remotely operated vehicles","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicle","synthetic aperture radar systems","UAV SAR","raw radar data","atmospheric turbulence","aircraft properties","3D motion error analysis","motion parameters extraction","forward velocity","line-of-sight direction displacement","Doppler rate estimate","inertial navigation system","3D MOCO method","motion compensation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion compensation (MOCO)","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Motion Compensation for UAV SAR Based on Raw Radar Data","volume":"47","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4895307/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10764069","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Compensation for UAV SAR Based on Raw Radar Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-xing-2015657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069383S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5165150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"5165150","articleId":"4895307","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4895316,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Wing Fu","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/4939467/4895316/4895316-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Wing Fu (M'98) received the B.

However, existing work typically neglects the effect of the sphere-to-plane mapping. In this paper, we show that by carefully designing the mapping, we can improve the visual quality, stability and compression efficiency of encoding omnidirectional videos. Here we propose a novel mapping scheme, known as the rhombic dodecahedron map (RD map) to represent data over the spherical domain. By using a family of skew great circles as the subdivision kernel, the RD map not only produces a sampling pattern with very low discrepancy, it can also support a highly efficient data indexing mechanism over the spherical domain. Since the proposed map is quad-based, geodesic-aligned, and of very low area and shape distortion, we can reliably apply 2-D wavelet-based and DCT-based encoding methods that are originally designated to planar perspective videos. At the end, we perform a series of analysis and experiments to investigate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method; with its ultra-fast data indexing capability, we show that we can playback omnidirectional videos with very high frame rates on conventional PCs with GPU support.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Rhombic Dodecahedron Map: An Efficient Scheme for Encoding Panoramic Video","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2009.2017626","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4939467/04895316.pdf","startPage":"634","endPage":"644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2009.2017626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"The Rhombic Dodecahedron Map: An Efficient Scheme for Encoding Panoramic Video","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4895316/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664203","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Rhombic Dodecahedron Map: An Efficient Scheme for Encoding Panoramic Video","sourcePdf":"11tmm04-twong-2017626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143401S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4939467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4939467","articleId":"4895316","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895318,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/4939467/4895318/4895318-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqing Zhu (S'01) received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering in 2001 from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2002 from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","She is recipient of the Stanford Graduate Fellowship from 2001 to 2005 and has worked on several research projects granted by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Modulation spectral analysis of every feature value will generate a corresponding modulation spectrum and all the modulation spectra can be collected to form a modulation spectrogram which exhibits the time-varying or rhythmic information of music signals. Each modulation spectrum is then decomposed into several logarithmically-spaced modulation subbands. The modulation spectral contrast (MSC) and modulation spectral valley (MSV) are then computed from each modulation subband. Effective and compact features are generated from statistical aggregations of the MSCs and MSVs of all modulation subbands. An information fusion approach which integrates both feature level fusion method and decision level combination method is employed to improve the classification accuracy. Experiments conducted on two different music datasets have shown that our proposed approach can achieve higher classification accuracy than other approaches with the same experimental setup.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4939467/04895319.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2009.2017635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2009.2017635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4939467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Music Genre Classification Based on Modulation Spectral Analysis of Spectral and Cepstral Features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectral analysis","Cepstral analysis","Multiple signal classification","Humans","Databases","MPEG 7 Standard","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Signal generators","Spectrogram","Fusion power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstral analysis","modulation","music","signal classification","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic music genre classification","modulation spectral analysis","cepstral feature","feature level fusion method","decision level combination method","statistical aggregation","time-varying signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients","modulation spectral analysis","music genre classification","normalized audio spectrum envelope","octave-based spectral contrast"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Music Genre Classification Based on Modulation Spectral Analysis of Spectral and Cepstral Features","volume":"11","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4895319/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664199","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Music Genre Classification Based on Modulation Spectral Analysis of Spectral and Cepstral Features","sourcePdf":"11tmm04-clee-2017635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099869S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4939467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4939467","articleId":"4895319","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895321,"authors":[{"name":"Armin Schimpf","affiliation":["IMEP-ENSERG, MINATEC-INPG, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/4895321/4895321-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Armin Schimpf received the prediploma degree in electrical engineering from Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe (TH), Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2004, where he is currently working toward the engineering diploma in electrical engineering.","He is currently performing a Diplomarbeit at Institut de Microl\u00e9ectronique, Electromagn\u00e9tisme et Photonique (IMEP), Grenoble, France."]},"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Schimpf","id":"37869465700"},{"name":"Davide Bucci","affiliation":["INPG, IMEP, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5170198/4895321/4895321-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Davide Bucci received the B.S. degree from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Electronique et de Radio\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 (ENSERG), Grenoble, France, in 2003, the Laurea degree in electronic engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, and the Master's degree in optoelectronics and integrated optics from the Institut National Polytechnique (INPG), Grenoble, in the same year, where he also received the Ph.D. degree in integrated optics, in 2006.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the Institute de Micro\u00e9lectronique, Electromagn\u00e9tisme et Photonique (IMEP), Grenoble.

Based on power balancing principle and feedforward decoupling control, this novel DOV control strategy cannot only reduce the active and reactive current control loops of a conventional double-loop control strategy but also achieve the decoupling control to regulate dc-link voltage and maintain the voltages at the point of common coupling (PCC). In order to effectively improve the immunity capability of this novel DOV control strategy to the uncertainties in system parameters, two fuzzy PI controllers are separately employed to maintain the voltages at the PCC and to simultaneously regulate dc-link voltage. The validity and effectiveness of this novel control strategy for the STATCOM used in utility distribution systems have been verified by simulation results, and a scaled physical prototype rated at plusmn300 kVAr is also developed to test the STATCOM system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-PI-Based Direct-Output-Voltage Control Strategy for the STATCOM Used in Utility Distribution Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2021172","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5154028/04895329.pdf","startPage":"2401","endPage":"2411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2021172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5154028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895329/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-PI-Based Direct-Output-Voltage Control Strategy for the STATCOM Used in Utility Distribution Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4895329/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10736220","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-PI-Based Direct-Output-Voltage Control Strategy for the STATCOM Used in Utility Distribution Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-luo-2021172.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088185S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5154028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5154028","articleId":"4895329","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4895331,"authors":[{"name":"Fei Gao","affiliation":["University of Technology of Belfort-Montb\u00e9liard, Belfort, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5463268/4895331/4895331-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei Gao (S'09) was born in Beijing, China, in 1983.

Simulation results are then compared with a Ballard 1.2-kW NEXA fuel-cell system and show a great agreement with experimental data. This complex multidomain VHDL-AMS stack model, containing more than 25 000 state variables and only few empirical coefficients (four parameters identified on the polarization curve), can be used for fuel-cell system components design and also for real-time applications. Real-time simulation is a key issue in many applications such as system control and hardware-in-the-loop applications.

The adaptive scheme consists of a parallel combination of a linear component, represented by crossband filters between subbands, and a quadratic component, which is modeled by multiplicative cross-terms. We adaptively update the model parameters using the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm, and derive explicit expressions for the transient and steady-state mean-square error (MSE) in frequency bins for white Gaussian inputs. We show that estimation of the nonlinear component improves the MSE performance only when the power ratio of nonlinear to linear components is relatively high. Furthermore, as the number of crossband filters increases, a lower steady-state MSE may be obtained at the expense of slower convergence. Experimental results support the theoretical derivations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Nonlinear System Identification in the Short-Time Fourier Transform Domain","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2021713","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5238723/04895344.pdf","startPage":"3891","endPage":"3904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2021713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Nonlinear System Identification in the Short-Time Fourier Transform Domain","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4895344/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869443","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Nonlinear System Identification in the Short-Time Fourier Transform Domain","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-icohen-2021713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128032S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5238723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5238723","articleId":"4895344","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895345,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Statistical Signal Processing, Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5200771/4895345/4895345-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xu Xu received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from the Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 1997 and the M.S. degree in communication and information system from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2000.","Since 2000, she has worked as a teacher at the Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science of the University of Science and Technology of China.

The impinging signals are a mixture of signals in different correlation degrees, which are uncorrelated, partially correlated or coherent with each other. The method proceeds in three steps. The noncoherent (uncorrelated or partially correlated) signals are firstly estimated with unknown mutual coupling. Then these estimates are utilized to get the mutual coupling coefficients. Finally, by eliminating the contributions of the noncoherent signals and compensating the mutual coupling effect, only coherent signals remain to be estimated. This method is simple but effective and does not need iterative processing.

The waveguides written with a femtosecond laser can be successfully connected to waveguides inside a PLC with low loss. Unlike previous work on the direct writing of 2-D and 3-D waveguides in bulk glass, the waveguide must be written a few tens of micrometers beneath the surface of a PLC composed of multilayers of different glasses. To realize a low-loss waveguide, we studied the sensitivity difference for femtosecond pulses in each layer in detail and developed a multiple-scanning technique with a femtosecond laser for writing waveguides. In addition, we investigated a mode-field (MF) diameter control technique to allow us to achieve the low-loss interconnection of PLC and written waveguides. We also studied particular problems caused by nonlinear optical effects, such as the positional displacement of written waveguides from the focal point. As a result, we achieved a low-loss waveguide with almost the same MF diameter as a PLC waveguide and performed the first demonstration of interconnection between PLC waveguides. The excess losses at 1550 nm were 1.4 and 2.3 dB for 2-D and 3-D interconnection, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2021775","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5208445/04895351.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2021775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208445","startPage":"4033","endPage":"4039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Waveguide Interconnection in Silica-Based Planar Lightwave Circuit Using Femtosecond Laser","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Waveguide Interconnection in Silica-Based Planar Lightwave Circuit Using Femtosecond Laser","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"18","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10866376","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895351/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveguide Interconnection in Silica-Based Planar Lightwave Circuit Using Femtosecond Laser","sourcePdf":"jlt-nasu-2021775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071594S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5208445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5208445","articleId":"4895351","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895353,"authors":[{"name":"Susai Lawrence Selvaraj","affiliation":["Research Center for Nano-Device and System, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Susai","lastName":"Lawrence Selvaraj","id":"37547091700"},{"name":"Takaaki Suzue","affiliation":["Research Center for Nano-Device and System, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Takaaki","lastName":"Suzue","id":"37680785500"},{"name":"Takashi Egawa","affiliation":["Research Center for Nano-Device and System, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Egawa","id":"37267267100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4895353","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":176,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3502},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium nitride","Electric breakdown","Aluminum gallium nitride","HEMTs","MODFETs","Silicon","Buffer layers","Surface resistance","Transconductance","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","buffer layers","current density","elemental semiconductors","gallium compounds","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","semiconductor device breakdown","silicon","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HEMT breakdown enhancement","high-electron mobility transistor fabrication","surface electrode","crack-free epilayer","size 9 mum","size 2 mum","voltage 403 V","size 3 mum","voltage 1813 V","size 10 mum","AlGaN-GaN","GaN","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT)","breakdown voltage","buffer breakdown","HEMT"]}],"abstract":"We have achieved a 9 \u00bfm-thick AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) epilayer on silicon using thick buffer layers with reduced dislocation density (D\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</sub>\n).

This paper proposes a task model using a Bayesian network (BN) for motion prediction. Given information of the previous motion, this task model is able to predict occurrence probabilities of the motions concerned in the task. Furthermore, a hybrid motion classification framework has been developed based on the BN motion prediction. Besides the motion prediction, electromyogram (EMG) signals are simultaneously classified by a probabilistic neural network (NN). Then, the motion occurrence probabilities are combined with the NN classifier's outputs to generate motion commands for control. With the proposed motion classification framework, it is expected that classification performance can be enhanced so that motion commands can be more robust and reliable. Experiments have been conducted with four subjects to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methods. In these experiments, forearm motions are classified with EMG signals considering a cooking task. Finally, robot manipulation experiments were carried out to verify the proposed human interface system with a task of taking meal. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methods improved the robustness and stability of motion classification.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2009.2019782","startPage":"502","endPage":"511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2009.2019782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5068831","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/5068831/04895361.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Motion Classification Approach for EMG-Based Human\u2013Robot Interfaces Using Bayesian and Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895361/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Motion Classification Approach for EMG-Based Human\u2013Robot Interfaces Using Bayesian and Neural Networks","volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4895361/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10713508","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Motion Classification Approach for EMG-Based Human\u2013Robot Interfaces Using Bayesian and Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tro-bu-2019782.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079552S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5068831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5068831","articleId":"4895361","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4895363,"authors":[{"name":"Christian R.

As communication is bandwidth- and energy-constrained, it has been suggested to use the properties of the MAC to combine the sensor observations directly on the channel. Although this leads to an array-processing gain if the sensors' transmissions combine coherently on the channel, it has been shown that this is not the case when they combine noncoherently. We review known results for the coherent case and then analyze the noncoherent case based on a simple on/off scheme combined with optimal sensor ldquocensoring.rdquo Since the optimal forwarding function is not available, we also bound the performance using an equivalent communication problem and a centralized estimator to verify trends. We find that for noncoherent modulation, there is no processing gain using the MAC for decentralized detection, but compared to parallel-access channels (PACs) the MAC avoids the noncoherent combining loss. Still the performance of the MAC approach is only of diversity one, as the output of the MAC is approximately a zero-mean complex Gaussian random variable for a large number of sensor. The MAC performance can be increased by using multiple independent channels, each used as a MAC by all sensors, which we term diversity-MAC. This approach always outperforms the PAC scheme on Rayleigh fading channels, where the output is exactly Gaussian, but has inferior performance across random phase channels when few sensors are used, as the PAC does not create ldquoartificialrdquo fading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAC vs. MAC for Decentralized Detection Using Noncoherent Modulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2021691","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5200771/04895363.pdf","startPage":"3562","endPage":"3575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2021691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200771","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895363/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"PAC vs. MAC for Decentralized Detection Using Noncoherent Modulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4895363/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10816646","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAC vs. MAC for Decentralized Detection Using Noncoherent Modulation","sourcePdf":"57tsp09-cberger-2021691.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099901S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5200771","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5200771","articleId":"4895363","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895373,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Okubo","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Okubo","id":"37306129100"},{"name":"Makoto Itami","affiliation":["Department of Applied Electronics, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Itami","id":"37284644000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895373","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital multimedia broadcasting","Data communication","Communication standards","Multiplexing","Diversity reception","OFDM","Bluetooth","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television","diversity reception","fading channels","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative reception","ISDB-T","multipath fading environments","diversity reception"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895373","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895373.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on cooperative reception of one segment ISDB-T","abstract":"Because of its narrow band characteristic, one segment ISDB-T reception is more degraded under multi-path fading environments than 13 segments ISDB-T reception.

Specifically, we first prove that the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure is exactly optimal (for any average run length to false alarm) with respect to the integral average detection delay. We then continue to tackle the problem of quickest detection of a change in a stationary regime, considered by Shiryaev in 1961 for a Brownian motion, and show that the repeated Shiryaev-Roberts procedure minimizes the expected delay to detection of a change occurring at a far horizon, which precedes by a stationary flow of false alarms.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895424.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact optimality of the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure for detecting changes in distributions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion detection","Information theory","Statistical distributions","Mathematics","Minimax techniques","H infinity control","Stochastic processes","Statistics","Delay effects","Filtration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimax techniques","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Shiryaev-Roberts procedure","change detection","statistical distribution","changepoint problem","minimax technique","optimality property","stationary regime","Brownian motion","false alarm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Exact optimality of the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure for detecting changes in distributions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895424/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614694","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact optimality of the Shiryaev-Roberts procedure for detecting changes in distributions","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064332S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4895426,"authors":[{"name":"Joanne L.

Simulation results are presented which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields performance close to that with other PAPR reduction solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient optimization for tone reservation OFDM","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895430","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895430.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895430","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient optimization for tone reservation OFDM","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895430/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614700","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient optimization for tone reservation OFDM","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039904S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4895431,"authors":[{"name":"Toru Uchino","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Toru Uchino","id":"37087836584"},{"name":"Hideki Ochiai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Ochiai","id":"37269532900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895431","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895431","abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, which is known to have a robustness against multipath environments, exhibits signal waveform with high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAR), and therefore some PAR reduction techniques should be incorporated for practical communication systems. The clipping and filtering (CAF) is known as a simple and practical method to reduce the PAR, but it introduces nonlinear distortion that may cause substantial degradation in its BER performance. The clipping noise cancellation (CNC) is a promising approach that can compensate for this degradation, but its achievable performance has not been thoroughly analyzed. In this paper, we study the achievable performance of a CNC technique for the OFDM with high-order coded modulation with CAF. We investigate the performance of the soft-input soft-output (SISO) iterative decoding between the channel decoder and soft mapping, which can significantly improve the BER performance at the cost of increasing receiver complexity. The existence of the SISO decoder also enables us to analyze the performance of CNC by EXIT chart. Furthermore, the performances of bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) and multilevel coded modulation (MLC) are compared and it turns out that MLC will outperform BICM in some cases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise cancellation","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Peak to average power ratio","Computer numerical control","Iterative decoding","Degradation","Bit error rate","Performance analysis","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","filtering theory","interference suppression","iterative decoding","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clipping noise cancellation","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","high-order coded modulation","peak-to-average power ratio","filtering","BER performance","soft-input soft-output iterative decoding","bit interleaved coded modulation","multilevel coded modulation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895431","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895431.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of clipping noise cancellation for OFDM systems with high-order coded modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the performance of clipping noise cancellation for OFDM systems with high-order coded modulation","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10614701","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895431/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of clipping noise cancellation for OFDM systems with high-order coded modulation","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0397S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4895432,"authors":[{"name":"Dae-Woon Lim","affiliation":["Department of Information Comm.

Multiple link pairs communicating through a relay can be beneficial in the wireless digital home network (DHN) scenario where various equipments exchange or share digital media contents. In the first hop from the source nodes to the relay, cooperative transmit-receive beamforming design is performed to maximize SINR at the relay. Then joint power allocation and transmit-receive beamforming is conducted in the second hop from the relay to the destination nodes based on the SINR constraints for each link pair. The beamforming filter is a group maximum SINR filter which exploits intra-group cooperation. The group-based uplink-downlink duality property in downlink channel is adopted and modified for amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over other methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895493","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895493.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO relay design for multiple link pairs based on SINR constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895493","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO relay design for multiple link pairs based on SINR constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895493/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614763","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895493/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO relay design for multiple link pairs based on SINR constraints","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100143S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4895494,"authors":[{"name":"Fumie Ono","affiliation":["Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumie","lastName":"Ono","id":"38035295000"},{"name":"Kei Sakaguchi","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Sakaguchi","id":"37266412100"},{"name":"Takayuki Sugiyasu","affiliation":["Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Sugiyasu","id":"38032204300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895494","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiplexing","numerical analysis","radio networks","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO two-way mesh network","mutlistream multiplexing","co-channel interference cancellation","numerical analysis","network reliability"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, mutli-stream multiplexing for MIMO two-way mesh network is considered.

The system is analyzed for two channels: the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and the AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel. The derived expressions for the probability of error and the bit error rate (BER) curves obtained by simulation for the case when the system is under the AWGN channel show that the system performs very similarly to the classical systems that use Walsh functions for the message bits encoding. However, for the case when the system is under the AWGN and Rayleigh flat fading channel, the theoretical expressions for the probability of error and BER curves obtained by simulation show that the system performs very badly. For a purpose of fading mitigation in this system, the chip interleaving technique is used. In our analysis, a chip interleaver/deinterleaver structure is incorporated into the system. The theoretical findings and simulation results confirm that the proposed chip interleaving technique is an efficient mean to mitigate fading in the reverse link of a chaos based CDMA (CB-CDMA) system.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895501","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895501.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a reverse chaos based CDMA link and fading mitigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895501","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895501/","displayDocTitle":"Development of a reverse chaos based CDMA link and fading mitigation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614771","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895501/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a reverse chaos based CDMA link and fading mitigation","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057465S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4895505,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoharu Awano","affiliation":["Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoharu","lastName":"Awano","id":"37865832100"},{"name":"Kenta Kasai","affiliation":["Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenta","lastName":"Kasai","id":"37283011200"},{"name":"Tomoharu Shibuya","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoharu","lastName":"Shibuya","id":"37283009300"},{"name":"Kohichi Sakaniwa","affiliation":["Communications and Integrated Systems, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kohichi","lastName":"Sakaniwa","id":"37283009600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895505","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Linear code","Code standards","Equations","Information theory","Mathematics","Bipartite graph","Sparse matrices","Iterative decoding","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-edge type LDPC code ensembles","exponentially few codewords","linear small weight","multi-edge type LDPC codes","irregular LDPC code ensembles","code length","linear weight codewords","two-edge type LDPC code ensembles"]}],"abstract":"Multi-edge type LDPC codes are introduced by Richardson and Urbanke, and they show examples of their ensembles have better performance than other known ensembles.

Rather than resorting to sophisticated interference cancellation schemes, excessive noise amplification due to ill-conditioned multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels is evaded by retransmission of signal parts in critical subspaces, facilitated by a low-rate feedback channel. This lets the great capacities of MIMO channels be capitalized on with low system complexity, without requiring channel state information at the transmitter end. The closed-loop architecture involves a reverse propagation of the noise power, which we study using the theory of Markov chains. Conditions are defined under which stationarity is attained, considering both infinite and finite-rate feedback, and the constrained ergodic capacity of the system is expressed.

The sense of asymptotic behavior we consider is the large-system limit in which the numbers of antennas at the transmitter and receiver go to infinity with constant ratio. Using the replica method, an analytical tool developed in statistical physics, we obtain not only the spectral efficiency formula that assumes optimal joint decoding at the receiver but also the asymptotic spectral efficiency of a more practical system which performs separate detection and decoding (spatial detection followed by a temporal error-correction decoder). The results not only encompass several previously published results as special cases, but also gives for the first time the asymptotic performances of optimal joint decoding and separate decoding with arbitrary input distribution in the general MIMO Rician channels. Through computer simulations, we see that the proposed asymptotic solution gives good estimates for the average mutual information of the channels even with only a few antenna elements at transmitter and receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895524.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic mutual information of multiple-path Rician fading MIMO multiple-access channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Rician channels","MIMO","Decoding","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","H infinity control","Performance analysis","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","multi-access systems","Rician channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic mutual information","multiple-path Rician fading channel","MIMO","multiple-access channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic mutual information of multiple-path Rician fading MIMO multiple-access channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895524/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614794","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic mutual information of multiple-path Rician fading MIMO multiple-access channel","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073886S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4895525,"authors":[{"name":"Kishor Barman","affiliation":["School of Technology and Computer Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Kishor","lastName":"Barman","id":"37545761000"},{"name":"Onkar Dabeer","affiliation":["School of Technology and Computer Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Onkar","lastName":"Dabeer","id":"37284182100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895525","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Delay","Pulse modulation","Transmitters","Computer science","Antenna theory","OFDM","Intersymbol interference","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","MIMO communication","pulse amplitude modulation","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system","asynchronous PAM","multiple input multiple output system","pulse amplitude modulation","antenna array","radio transmitter","spectral mask constraint","channel capacity","spectrum analysis","optimal water-filling based scheme","directional link","uniform power allocation"]}],"abstract":"Consider a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system, where each transmit antenna uses pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), possibly with an antenna dependent delay introduced deliberately at the transmitter.

Numerical results demonstrate improvement over each fixed mode with adaptive modulation in terms of average spectral efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Diversity reception","Modulation coding","Block codes","Bit error rate","Transmitters","Feedback","Communication switching","Switches","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","block codes","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","space division multiplexing","space-time codes","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate adaptive modulation","MIMO mode switching","spatial multiplexing","multiple-input multiple-output systems","space-time codes","bit error ratio","orthogonal space-time block coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895551","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895551.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate adaptive modulation with MIMO mode switching between spatial multiplexing and diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895551","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rate adaptive modulation with MIMO mode switching between spatial multiplexing and diversity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895551/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895551/","accessionNumber":"10614821","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate adaptive modulation with MIMO mode switching between spatial multiplexing and diversity","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069639S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4895552,"authors":[{"name":"Vesna Gardasevic","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Vesna","lastName":"Gardasevic","id":"38032356900"},{"name":"Ralf R.

However the code design based on the density evolution can be used only for simple code structure like LDPC codes and repeat-accumulate (RA) codes. Recently simple and accurate irregular LDPC code design method based on the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart was introduced for an AWGN channel. This code design scheme is much flexible, therefore it can be used for any kind of code structure like turbo codes. In this paper we design an irregular LDPC code for a MIMO system using the EXIT chart based scheme. The EXIT charts are used to obtain the optimal edge degree distribution of the irregular LDPC code combined with the MMSE-SIC MIMO detector. This scheme can be generalized for designing the optimal iterative MIMO detector combined with any kind of channel codes including turbo codes.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895553","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895553.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of low-density parity-check codes for multi-input multi-output systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895553","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895553/","displayDocTitle":"Design of low-density parity-check codes for multi-input multi-output systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614823","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895553/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of low-density parity-check codes for multi-input multi-output systems","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044374S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4895554,"authors":[{"name":"Yukio Tsuchiya","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukio","lastName":"Tsuchiya","id":"38031519100"},{"name":"Yasunori Iwanami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasunori","lastName":"Iwanami","id":"37297405600"},{"name":"Eiji Okamoto","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37074851100"},{"name":"Keiichiro Hayakawa","affiliation":["Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Nagakute, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiichiro","lastName":"Hayakawa","id":"37924056700"},{"name":"Katsushi Sanda","affiliation":["Toyota Central Research and Development Laboratories, Inc., Nagakute, Aichi, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsushi","lastName":"Sanda","id":"37402662900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895554","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"abstract":"Wireless transmissions with high data rate and high reliability are very demanding.

In this paper we introduce a new cooperative communications protocol for direct-sequence code-division-multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems that increases the SNR range over which there is no significant throughput loss compared to direct transmission. This eliminates the necessity for switching between more than one scheme which leads to higher system complexity. The proposed new scheme has a high spectral efficiency (reaching one asymptotically with the SNR and block size) at the cost of extra spreading sequences. However the channels are allowed to be non-orthogonal, and we analyze the effect of that on cooperative diversity under the LMMSE receiver. We present both achievable and outage throughput analysis under different cross correlations between user codes. From our results we show that the proposed scheme improves the throughput and the outage throughput performance in high SNR at the expense of only a negligible loss in the low SNR region compared to the previously proposed reference scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895565","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895565.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An asymptotically full rate cooperative communication scheme for DS-CDMA systems with non-orthogonal codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895565","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An asymptotically full rate cooperative communication scheme for DS-CDMA systems with non-orthogonal codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895565/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614835","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895565/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asymptotically full rate cooperative communication scheme for DS-CDMA systems with non-orthogonal codes","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050259S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4895567,"authors":[{"name":"Wayne Griffiths","affiliation":["Wireless Systems Laboratory, Western Australian Telecommunications Research Institute, Nedlands, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Griffiths","id":"38056016300"},{"name":"Hans-Jurgen Zepernick","affiliation":["Blekinge Institute of Technology, Radio Communications Group, Ronneby, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hans-Jurgen","lastName":"Zepernick","id":"37269932400"},{"name":"Manora Caldera","affiliation":["Gibson Quai-AAS Consulting, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Manora","lastName":"Caldera","id":"37283442400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895567","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Block codes","Australia","Parity check codes","Polynomials","Stochastic processes","Information theory","Laboratories","Communications technology","Radio communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","matrix multiplication","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["a posteriori probability decoding algorithm","nonbinary block codes","Gilbert-Elliott channels","generalized weight polynomials","matrix multiplications","channel reliability factor","burst factor"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"APP decoding of non-binary block codes on Gilbert-Elliott channels using generalized weight polynomials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895567","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895567","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895567.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","abstract":"In this paper, we present an a posteriori probability (APP) decoding algorithm for non-binary block codes on non-binary Gilbert-Elliott channels (GECs) using generalized weight polynomials.

By fixing the crossover probability in the dasiabadpsila state of the non-binary GEC such that for a given transmitted symbol, all symbols are equally likely to be received, an APP decoding decision can efficiently be reached by evaluating trivariate polynomials. In this case, the non-binary GEC is described by three variables that are referred to as the average fade to connection time ratio, the burst factor, and the channel reliability factor.

In this paper, a systematic construction for the codes for combined channel estimation and error protection is proposed. Simulations show that it can yield codes of comparable performance to the computer-searched best codes. In addition, the structural codes can now be maximum-likelihoodly decodable in terms of a newly derived recursive metric for use of the priority-first search decoding algorithm. Thus, the decoding complexity reduces considerably when compared with that of the exhaustive decoder. In light of the rule-based construction, the feasible codeword length that was previously limited by the capability of code-search computers can now be further extended, and therefore facilitates their applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895568.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-orthogonal code and its maximum-likelihood decoder for combined channel estimation and error protection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Channel estimation","Protection","Computer errors","System performance","Design optimization","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","computational complexity","equalisers","maximum likelihood decoding","orthogonal codes","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-orthogonal code","maximum-likelihood decoder","combined channel estimation","error protection","channel equalization","channel estimation","recursive metric","priority-first search decoding algorithm","decoding complexity","rule-based construction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A self-orthogonal code and its maximum-likelihood decoder for combined channel estimation and error protection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895568/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895568/","accessionNumber":"10614838","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-orthogonal code and its maximum-likelihood decoder for combined channel estimation and error protection","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04276S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4895569,"authors":[{"name":"Yunghsiang S.

Among them, the wrap-around Viterbi algorithm (WAVA) proposed is the one with least decoding complexity. Very recently, a maximum likelihood (ML) decoding algorithm has been proposed. The scheme has two phases. The Viterbi algorithm is applied to the trellis of the convolutional tail-biting code and the information obtained in the first phase is used by algorithm A*, which is performed to all subtrellises, in the second phase. In this work, a new two-phase ML decoding algorithm is proposed. From the simulation results for the (2, 1, 12) convolutional tail-biting code, the proposed algorithm has 16 times less average decoding complexity in the second phase when compared to the one using algorithm A* and 15123 times less than that of the WAVA, respectively, when SNR\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sub>\n=4 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895569.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priority-first search decoding for convolutional tail-biting codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Viterbi algorithm","Information theory","Cities and towns","Communication systems","Error analysis","Error correction","Digital communication","Shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","convolutional codes","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","search problems","trellis codes","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional tail-biting code","priority-first search decoding complexity","communication system","near-optimal word error rate","circular Viterbi decoding","wrap-around Viterbi algorithm","maximum likelihood decoding algorithm","trellis code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Priority-first search decoding for convolutional tail-biting codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895569/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614839","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Priority-first search decoding for convolutional tail-biting codes","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045627S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4895581,"authors":[{"name":"Naresh Sharma","affiliation":["Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Naresh","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37270371500"},{"name":"Shlomo Shamai","affiliation":["Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomo","lastName":"Shamai","id":"37267375900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895581","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing the discrete capacity achieving distribution with peak power constraint at the transition points","abstract":"The capacity-achieving input distribution for many channels like the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels under a peak power constraint is discrete with a finite number of mass points. The number of mass points is itself a variable and figuring it out is part of the optimization problem. We wish to understand the behavior of the optimal input distribution at the transition points where the number of mass points changes. We give a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions at the transition points, which offer new insights into the transition and make the computation of the optimal distribution easier. These conditions can be simplified, at least in the real channel case, by assuming the conjecture that the number of mass points increases monotonically and by at most one as the constraint on the input is relaxed. In particular, we show that for zero mean, unit variance Gaussian noise, the peak amplitude A of 1:671 and 2:786 mark the points where the binary and ternary signaling respectively are no longer optimal.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895581.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895581","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["AWGN channels","Constraint theory","Additive white noise","Sufficient conditions","Gaussian noise","Fading","Transmitters","Signal to noise ratio","Information theory","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","optimisation","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete channel capacity","capacity-achieving input distribution","additive white Gaussian noise channels","mass points","optimization problem","unit variance Gaussian noise","zero mean Gaussian noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Characterizing the discrete capacity achieving distribution with peak power constraint at the transition points","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614851","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895581/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895581/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing the discrete capacity achieving distribution with peak power constraint at the transition points","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048425S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4895582,"authors":[{"name":"Amine Mezghani","affiliation":["Institute for Circuit Theory and Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Amine","lastName":"Mezghani","id":"37294420600"},{"name":"Michel T.

As a result, the dramatic improvement of the frequency usage efficiency can be expected. Since the cognitive radio system is independent from the license system, it should recognize the wireless communication parameter of the license system, such as frequency, modulation scheme, and so on. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which can transmit multiple data signals with using single frequency spectrum, is applied to cognitive radio, and thus frequency use efficiency is more significantly improved. In MIMO-cognitive radio system, when new cognitive user tries to use the frequency resource, it is necessary that the new user should detect the number of parallel transmitted symbols which the license user transmit, because the new user should remove the interference signals whose number is the same as that of data symbol transmitted by the license user.

In MIMO multiplexing, signal separation/detection is one of the most important signal processing parts, so that the signal separation/detection schemes have been vigorously researching. Recently, as a promising signal separation/detection scheme, frequency-domain iterative interference cancellation (FD-IIC) has been proposed. FD-IIC can achieve good transmission performance which is close to lower bound when QPSK is used. However, the accuracy of signal separation/detection significantly degrades in case of high data modulation. Therefore, in this paper, to improve the accuracy of signal separation/detection, we propose layered-symbol iterative interference cancellation (LSIC). We consider single-carrier (SC) MIMO multiplexing and the achievable frame error rate (FER) performances with LSIC are evaluated by computer simulation to show that LSIC can provide better FER performance than FD-IIC.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895586","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895586.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission performance of layered-symbol iterative interference cancellation for single-carrier MIMO multiplexing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895586","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895586/","displayDocTitle":"Transmission performance of layered-symbol iterative interference cancellation for single-carrier MIMO multiplexing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614856","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895586/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission performance of layered-symbol iterative interference cancellation for single-carrier MIMO multiplexing","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063801S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4895598,"authors":[{"name":"Vu Thanh Nam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Vu Thanh","lastName":"Nam","id":"38253526800"},{"name":"Pooi Yuen Kam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Pooi Yuen","lastName":"Kam","id":"37280044700"},{"name":"Yan Xin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Xin","id":"37293344500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895598","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":63},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895598","abstract":"This paper studies the detection and decoding of LDPC encoded, interleaved, BDPSK-modulated symbols on the correlated flat Rayleigh fading channel using two-symbol-interval observations.

We simulate the performance of the system with this metric, and compare it with that of other metrics that do not take into account the fade rate. Numerical results are given for different codes. In practice, the fade rate may not be precisely known at the receiver, so we also examine how the system performance is affected if the actual fade rate differs from the assumed fade rate.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895598","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895598.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative decoding of BDPSK modulated LDPC codes using two-symbol-interval observations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Modulation coding","Parity check codes","Fading","AWGN","Amplitude estimation","Probability density function","Information theory","Application software","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","correlation methods","differential phase shift keying","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes","product codes","Rayleigh channels","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BDPSK","binary differential phase shift keying","modulated LDPC code","low density parity check code","iterative decoding","two-symbol-interval observation","correlated flat Rayleigh fading channel","log-likelihood metric","sum-product decoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Iterative decoding of BDPSK modulated LDPC codes using two-symbol-interval observations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895598/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614868","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative decoding of BDPSK modulated LDPC codes using two-symbol-interval observations","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper299.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046834S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4895608,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Hence, proper power controlling is of paramount importance to ensure efficient system operation. The previous work on power control in cognitive networks mainly focuses on the interactions among a set of secondary users. The primary users' influence is rarely considered. In this paper, a new power control game model is formulated, by including the primary users into the player set of the game. The primary users are rewarded for sharing their licensed spectrum with secondary users by setting a reasonable interference cap for the secondary transmissions. However, we ensure a minimum required Quality of Service (QoS) for primary users by severely penalizing their utility if their required transmission quality is not met. Simultaneously, the secondary users achieve energy efficient transmissions while not introducing much interference to both the primary and other secondary users. We prove that the proposed cognitive power control game has a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). The numerical examples show that the proposed game theoretical power control algorithm can provide the secondary users with energy efficient transmissions and the primary users with reasonable monetary rewards, while not compromising their required QoS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","accessionNumber":"10614914","htmlLink":"/document/4895644/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel primary-secondary user power control game for cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel primary-secondary user power control game for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050442S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4895646,"authors":[{"name":"Shimpei Yasukawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Japan"],"firstName":"Shimpei","lastName":"Yasukawa","id":"38035394900"},{"name":"Hisato Iwai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisato","lastName":"Iwai","id":"37289558500"},{"name":"Hideichi Sasaoka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideichi","lastName":"Sasaoka","id":"37299796400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895646","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":442},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character generation","OFDM","Fading","Time measurement","Frequency measurement","Communication system security","Fluctuations","Quantization","Wireless communication","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","discrete cosine transforms","error detection","mobile radio","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive key generation","secret key agreement scheme","OFDM mobile radio","DCT-based preprocessing","channel response","error detecting method"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed an adaptive key generation based on the channel characteristics in OFDM mobile radio.

Recently, Eckford et al. proposed a design method of irregular LDPC codes using approximate density-evolution (DE) for Markov channels. In the design method proposed by Eckford et al., the probability density function (PDF) of the messages from variable nodes to check nodes is approximated by the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we first show the method to obtain the accurate PDF of the messages from variable nodes to check nodes by utilizing two DE steps for the Gaussian distribution. We call this method the iterative density approximation (IDA). Using this method, we can design the good LDPC codes. Next, we propose an efficient design method of irregular LDPC codes by using Beta approximation to the PDF of the channel state probability for the GE channel. Consequently, we show that the complexity to calculate PDFs of the channel messages is considerably reduced though the rates of LDPC codes obtained by using the proposed approximation are almost the same as that of the IDA method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895649.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient design of irregular LDPC codes using beta approximation for the Gilbert-Elliott channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Design methodology","Gaussian distribution","Performance analysis","Iterative algorithms","Design engineering","Density functional theory","Iterative methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","isotope shifts","iterative methods","Markov processes","parity check codes","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["irregular LDPC codes","beta approximation","Gilbert-Elliott channel","low-density parity-check codes","density-evolution","Markov channels","probability density function","Gaussian distribution","iterative density approximation","channel state probability","channel messages"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An efficient design of irregular LDPC codes using beta approximation for the Gilbert-Elliott channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895649/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614629","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient design of irregular LDPC codes using beta approximation for the Gilbert-Elliott channel","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"4895649.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070593S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4895650,"authors":[{"name":"Sunghoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Mobile Communications, LG Electronics, Inc., Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sunghoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37695863500"},{"name":"Kwangseok Noh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwangseok Noh","id":"37319891600"},{"name":"Jeong Hwan Shin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jeong Hwan Shin","id":"37400264000"},{"name":"Jun Heo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Heo","id":"37306786300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2068-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2069-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4895650","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","AWGN","Performance analysis","Mobile communication","Additive white noise","Pattern analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Information theory","Standardization","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","parity check codes","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-compatible punctured LDPC code","recovery tree","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN channel","multiple survived check node","multiple dead check node"]}],"abstract":"We consider the challenges of finding good puncturing patterns for rate-compatible LDPC codes over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.

Based on theses analyses, we propose new algorithm to find good puncturing pattern for LDPC codes over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895650","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895650.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-compatible punctured LDPC codes based on recovery tree","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895650","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rate-compatible punctured LDPC codes based on recovery tree","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895650/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614630","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895650/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-compatible punctured LDPC codes based on recovery tree","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046972S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4895658,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Transmit beamformers can be designed by setting constraints on the interference temperature of the licensed users and signal to interference and noise ratios (SINRs) of the cognitive users. This design is however very sensitive to errors in channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we propose robust beamforming techniques for cognitive radios using worst-case performance optimization. The proposed beamformer has the ability to control the interference leaked to licensed users below a target value for all possible errors in the CSI. The problem is formulated within a convex optimization framework with constraints on worst-case errors. The performance of the robust beamformer is compared with non-robust beamformer in terms of bit error rates of the licensed users and probability density function of the interference power.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895658","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/04895658.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust interference control techniques for cognitive radios using worst-case performance optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895658","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895658/","displayDocTitle":"Robust interference control techniques for cognitive radios using worst-case performance optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10614637","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4895658/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust interference control techniques for cognitive radios using worst-case performance optimization","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"paper59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046723S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"4895658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4895666,"authors":[{"name":"Behrouz Maham","affiliation":["UNIK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Behrouz","lastName":"Maham","id":"37298195400"},{"name":"Are Hjorungnes","affiliation":["UNIK-University Graduate Center, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Are","lastName":"Hjorungnes","id":"37270835900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4895666","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":693},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Relays","Rician channels","Error analysis","Analytical models","Cellular networks","Rayleigh channels","Wireless networks","Wireless communication","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio networks","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward opportunistic relaying","Rician fading channel","single relay selection cooperative wireless network","symbol error rate","M-PSK modulation","M-QAM modulation","SNR","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communications","opportunistic relaying","performance analysis","Rician fading"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895666","abstract":"This letter analyzes the performance of single relay selection cooperative wireless networks using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">amplify-and</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">forward</i>\n relaying.

The approach is motivated by the high number of false alarms that typically results when using radiation portal monitors. Our approach is a three-stage anomaly detection process that consists of transforming the radiation sensor data into wavelet coefficients, representing the transformed data in binary form, and detecting anomalies among data sets using a proximity-based method. The approach is evaluated using simulated radiation data, and the results are encouraging. From a transportation security perspective, our results indicate that the concomitant use of gross count and spectroscopy radiation data improves identification of trucks transporting illicit radioactive materials. The results also suggest that the use of additional heterogeneous data with radiation data may enhance the reliability of the detection process.

Iterative soft-decision decoding algorithms for LDPC codes reach excellent error correction capability; their performance, however, is strongly affected by finite-precision issues in the representation of inner variables. Great attention has been paid, in recent literature, to the topic of quantization for LDPC decoders, but mostly focusing on binary modulations and analysing finite precision effects in a disaggregrated manner, i.e., considering separately each block of the receiver. Modern telecommunication standards, instead, often adopt high order modulation schemes, e.g. \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-QAM, with the aim to achieve large spectral efficiency. This puts additional quantization problems, that have been poorly debated in previous literature. This paper discusses the choice of suitable quantization characteristics for both the decoder messages and the received samples in LDPC-coded systems using \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-QAM schemes. The analysis involves also the demapper block, that provides initial likelihood values for the decoder, by relating its quantization strategy with that of the decoder. A new demapper version, based on approximate expressions, is also presented, that introduces a slight deviation from the ideal case but yields a low complexity hardware implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"55","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10666142","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895676/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Precision Analysis of Demappers and Decoders for LDPC-Coded M-QAM Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Precision Analysis of Demappers and Decoders for LDPC-Coded M-QAM Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-baldi-2016498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090215S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4976143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4976143","articleId":"4895676","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":4895688,"authors":[{"name":"Giulia Boato","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/4957614/4895688/4895688-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giulia Boato (S'04\u2013A'06) received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication technologies in 2005, both from the University of Trento, Italy.","In 2006, she was a visiting researcher at the University of Vigo, Spain.

In particular, few researchers have addressed the challenge to recognize noncooperative or even uncooperative subjects who try to cheat the recognition system by deliberately changing their facial appearance through such tricks as variant expressions or disguise (e.g., by partial occlusions). This paper addresses these problems within the framework of similarity matching. A novel perception-inspired nonmetric partial similarity measure is introduced, which is potentially useful in dealing with the concerned problems because it can help capture the prominent partial similarities that are dominant in human perception. Two methods, based on the general golden section rule and the maximum margin criterion, respectively, are proposed to automatically set the similarity threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed method in handling large expressions, partial occlusions, and other distortions is demonstrated on several well-known face databases.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2009.2020772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/4957614/04895689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2009.2020772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957614","startPage":"217","endPage":"230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Under Occlusions and Variant Expressions With Partial Similarity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Under Occlusions and Variant Expressions With Partial Similarity","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895689/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664306","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4895689/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Under Occlusions and Variant Expressions With Partial Similarity","sourcePdf":"04tifs02-schen-2020772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134265S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4957614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4957614","articleId":"4895689","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895693,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Zhai","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5170177/4895693/4895693-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Zhai received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Peking University, China, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2004 and 2007.","He is a currently a Senior Design Engineer with Advanced Micro Devices, Austin, TX.

In this paper, we present a highly efficient subthreshold microprocessor targeting sensor application. It is optimized across different design stages including ISA definition, microarchitecture evaluation and circuit and implementation optimization. Our investigation concludes that microarchitectural decisions in the subthreshold regime differ significantly from that in conventional superthreshold mode. We propose a new general-purpose sensor processor architecture, which we call the Subliminal Processor. On the circuit side, subthreshold operation is known to exhibit an optimal energy point (Knin)- However, propagation delay also becomes more sensitive to process variation and can reduce the energy scaling gain. We conduct thorough analysis on how supply voltage and operating frequency impact energy efficiency in a statistical context. With careful library cell selection and robust static RAM design, the Subliminal Processor operates correctly down to 200 mV in a 0.13-mum technology, which is sufficiently low to operate at V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</sub>\n .

Besides the practical importance of the overhead cranes, this study is also theoretically interesting because four variables (trolley and girder positions, two swing angles) should be controlled using two control inputs (trolley and girder forces). To control such an underactuated system as cranes, a simple proportional-derivative (PD) controller has been normally used. Unlike the conventional regulation control, the newly proposed nonlinear tracking control law further improves the performance and robustness, which is based on the feedback linearizing control by using the swing angular rate as well as the swing angle. The proposed nonlinear tracking control law eliminates the nonlinear characteristics of the system and achieves the satisfactory position control and swing suppression, even when the initial swing angle and the variation of payload weight exist.

In this paper, this basic idea is explored from an information-theoretic standpoint by focusing on a two-cell scenario where the involved base stations (BSs) are connected via a finite-capacity backbone link. A number of transmission strategies are considered that aim at improving uplink confidentiality under constraints on the downlink rate that acts as an interfering signal. The strategies differ mainly in the way the backbone link is exploited by the cooperating downlink to the uplink-operated BSs. Achievable rates are derived for both the Gaussian (unfaded) and the fading cases, under different assumptions on the channel state information available at different nodes. Numerical results are also provided to corroborate the analysis. Extensions to scenarios with more than two cells are briefly discussed as well. Overall, the analysis reveals that a combination of scheduling and base-station cooperation is a promising means to improve transmission confidentiality in cellular systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/4957614/04895697.pdf","startPage":"242","endPage":"256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2009.2020776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2009.2020776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4895697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Secrecy in Cellular Systems With Infrastructure-Aided Cooperation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Interference","Downlink","Communication system security","Wireless networks","Spine","Base stations","Channel state information","Information theory","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","fading channels","Gaussian channels","radiofrequency interference","scheduling","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless secrecy","cellular system","infrastructure-aided cooperation","uplink transmission","eavesdropping terminal","scheduling","concurrent downlink transmission","information-theoretic standpoint","finite-capacity backbone link","Gaussian channel","fading channel","channel state information","base-station cooperation","two-cell scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular systems","perfect secrecy","physical-layer wireless security","wireless infrastructure networks","wireless interference","wire-tap channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4895697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Secrecy in Cellular Systems With Infrastructure-Aided Cooperation","volume":"4","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4895697/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10664307","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Secrecy in Cellular Systems With Infrastructure-Aided Cooperation","sourcePdf":"04tifs02-ppopovski-2020776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118245S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4957614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4957614","articleId":"4895697","onlineDate":"28 April 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4895699,"authors":[{"name":"Christos D.

This problem considers customer demand to be formed by 3-D rectangular items. Additional loading constraints often encountered in real-life applications of transportation logistics are imposed on the examined problem model. In addition to 3L-CVRP, we also introduce and solve a new practical problem version that was dictated by a transportation logistics company and covers cases in which transported items are manually unloaded from the loading spaces of the vehicles. Both problem versions are solved by a hybrid metaheuristic methodology that combines the strategies of tabu search (TS) and guided local search (GLS).

The proposed algorithm's robustness was tested for both problem versions, solving benchmark instances derived from the literature and new benchmark problems with diverse features in terms of customer set size and transported-item dimensions.

The conventional PTS technique can provide good PAPR reduction performance for OFDM signals; however, it requires an exhaustive search over all combinations of allowed phase factors, resulting in high complexity. In order to reduce the complexity while still improving the PAPR statistics of an OFDM signal, a new method using the cross-entropy (CE) method is proposed to reduce both the PAPR and the computational load. In the proposed CE method, we first define a score or fitness function based on the corresponding PAPR reduction performance.

The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CE method provides almost the same PAPR reduction as that of the conventional exhaustive search algorithm while maintaining low complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Transmit Sequences for Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction of OFDM Signals With the Cross-Entropy Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2017221","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4838850/04897235.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2017221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4838850","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4897235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4897235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Partial Transmit Sequences for Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction of OFDM Signals With the Cross-Entropy Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4897235/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10625960","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Transmit Sequences for Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Reduction of OFDM Signals With the Cross-Entropy Method","sourcePdf":"16lsp06-jchen-2017221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044747S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4838850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4838850","articleId":"4897235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4897236,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Stowell","affiliation":["Centre for Digital Music, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Stowell","id":"38048587400"},{"name":"Mark D.

As with an electrical machine, source and converter flux, which equal the integration of the respective source and converter voltage, are used to define active and reactive power flow. Optimization of the lookup table used in conventional DPC is outlined first so as to improve power control and reduce current distortion. Then, constant switching frequency DPC is developed where the required converter voltage vector within a fixed half switching period is calculated directly from the active and reactive power errors. Detailed angle compensation due to the finite sampling frequency and the use of an integral controller to further improve the power control accuracy are described. Both simulation and experimental results are used to compare conventional DPC and vector control, and to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategies during active and reactive power steps, and line inductance variations.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2012497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4815917/04897244.pdf","startPage":"1280","endPage":"1292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2012497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4815917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Direct Power Control of Grid-Connected DC/AC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4897244/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved Direct Power Control of Grid-Connected DC/AC Converters","volume":"24","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10626156","htmlLink":"/document/4897244/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Direct Power Control of Grid-Connected DC/AC Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-xu-2012497.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084226S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4815917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"4815917","articleId":"4897244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4897255,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroomi Isozaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Hiroomi Isozaki","id":"37087645640"},{"name":"Shingo Ata","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Shingo Ata","id":"37087285824"},{"name":"Ikuo Oka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan"],"lastName":"Ikuo Oka","id":"37087641764"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-960761-3-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"4897255","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Statistics","Statistical distributions","Pareto analysis","Probability","Statistical analysis","Telecommunication traffic","Estimation error","Maximum likelihood estimation","Pareto optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet radio networks","statistical analysis","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow distribution","multiple packet samplings","traffic measurement","high speed routers","probabilistic theory","statistic information"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4897255","abstract":"Packet sampling is one of effective ways to reduce the overhead of the traffic measurement at high speed routers, in which the router collects only a part of whole traffic based on the probabilistic theory.

It should also take into account maximization of the radio resource utilization of the entire system, in which the radio resource of each cell must be shared by the base station and relay stations. In this paper, we propose a joint bandwidth allocation and routing scheme for an OFDMA-based multi-hop cellular system. This scheme uses a polynomial time heuristic algorithm called Multi-Dimensional Multi-choice Knapsack Problem (MMKP) in order to find an approximate solution maximizing the total downlink throughput. In the simulation results, we show that the proposed scheme finds a sub-optimal solution which is superior to a link quality-based routing scheme, but slightly worse than the optimal solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4897284/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10614952","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","conferenceDate":"21-24 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4897284/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A joint bandwidth allocation and routing scheme for the IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint bandwidth allocation and routing scheme for the IEEE 802.16j multi-hop relay networks","confLoc":"Chiang Mai, Thailand","sourcePdf":"5A-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040954S","chronDate":"21-24 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4816117","isNumber":"4897247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816117","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4897247","articleId":"4897284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers (KIISE)","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4897317,"authors":[{"name":"Ruangchaijatupon Nararat","affiliation":["Sogo Kenkyu Daigakuin Daigaku, Miura-gun, Kanagawa, JP"],"firstName":"Ruangchaijatupon","lastName":"Nararat"},{"name":"Yusheng Ji","affiliation":["The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, 2-1-2 Hitotsubashi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yusheng Ji"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-960761-3-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"4897317","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless networks","Throughput","Modulation coding","Interference","Informatics","Frequency conversion","WiMAX","Narrowband","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","frequency allocation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","radio networks","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","quality of service","OFDMA wireless network","network resource","time domain","subchannel assignment","queue length","multiuser diversity","data transmission"]}],"abstract":"We propose a centralized resource allocation scheme called Proportional Fairness with Adjustable QoS (PF-AQ) for an OFDMA wireless system, which transmitting data on a frame basis.

An efficient use of the fluctuating solar power production will highly benefit from forecast information on the expected power production. This forecast information is necessary for the management of the electricity grids and for solar energy trading. This paper presents an approach to predict regional PV power output based on forecasts up to three days ahead provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Focus of the paper is the description and evaluation of the approach of irradiance forecasting, which is the basis for PV power prediction. One day-ahead irradiance forecasts for single stations in Germany show a rRMSE of 36%. For regional forecasts, forecast accuracy is increasing in dependency on the size of the region. For the complete area of Germany, the rRMSE amounts to 13%. Besides the forecast accuracy, also the specification of the forecast uncertainty is an important issue for an effective application. We present and evaluate an approach to derive weather specific prediction intervals for irradiance forecasts. The accuracy of PV power prediction is investigated in a case study.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2020300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/4897342/04897348.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2009.2020300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Irradiance Forecasting for the Power Prediction of Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4897348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 April 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4897348/","displayDocTitle":"Irradiance Forecasting for the Power Prediction of Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems","volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10601489","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4897348/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Irradiance Forecasting for the Power Prediction of Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems","sourcePdf":"jstars-lorenz-2020300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056723S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"4897342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"437","xplore-issue":"4897342","articleId":"4897348","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4897355,"authors":[{"name":"Vandana Vikas Thakare","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Anand Engineering College, Agra, India"],"firstName":"Vandana Vikas","lastName":"Thakare","id":"38034367900"},{"name":"Pramod Singhal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Pramod","lastName":"Singhal","id":"37265117000"},{"name":"Kamya Das","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Kamya","lastName":"Das","id":"38035842000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2866-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2867-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4897355","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":608},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Bandwidth","Artificial neural networks","Circuit simulation","Neural networks","Computational modeling","Neurons","Antenna feeds","Training data","Microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","electrical engineering computing","feedforward neural nets","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna bandwidth calculation","artificial neural network","resonant antenna","network training data","inset feed rectangular microstrip patch antenna","feed forward network structure","IE3D electromagnetic simulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microstrip antenna","Bandwidth","Simulation","Modeling","Neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4897355","abstract":"An artificial neural network has been developed for the calculation of bandwidth of resonant microstrip antenna.

This paper presents a simulation to investigate the performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as a modulation technique to transmit the basebands signal over fiber. The model contains a laser diode used as optical modulator to convert the signal from baseband to optical frequency. The QPSK-OFDM transmitted signal and power spectrum are obtained for both of AWGN and optical fiber link channels. The study reveals that the OFDM performance on the optical fiber link in terms of spectrum containment is nearly similar to that on AWGN channel. The significance of this study comes from the promising future of using optical fibers to transmit radio signal. Consequently the model of this paper can be used with different wireless communication systems such as wireless LANs and digital video broadcasting (DVB) and it is supporting to the 4th generation cellular systems. The details of design and simulated results for the proposed model are presented and discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study the performance of OFDM radio over fiber for wireless communication systems","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/RFM.2008.4897393","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International RF and Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4833599/4897351/04897393.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFM.2008.4897393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897351","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4897393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4897393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Study the performance of OFDM radio over fiber for wireless communication systems","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4897393/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10625153","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study the performance of OFDM radio over fiber for wireless communication systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064115S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4833599","isNumber":"4897351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4833599","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4897351","articleId":"4897393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4897420,"authors":[{"name":"F.N.

The image reconstruction algorithm is based on the gradient minimization of an augmented cost function defined as the different between measured and calculated fields. The algorithm requires two successive steps for convergent: the direct and the adjoint solutions. The forward-backward time stepping algorithm, implementing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method with PML absorbing boundaries was used in the calculation. Image reconstruction was based on Born approximation in which the solution was obtained after the first iteration. Multiple view simulated data was used to validate the accuracy of this inversion method.
