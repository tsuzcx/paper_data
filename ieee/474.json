In order to avoid unnecessary calculation, the sampled data in high-speed digital system have to be down-sampled. Three designs of down-sample are discussed and compared with each other in this paper so that people choose the most suitable plan in different works. One with FIR filters is a classical design and is applied widely. The other is an unfamiliar design which is applied directly to band-pass signal. Another is the CIC decimation filter design which is used in recent years. Specially, the theory and design technique of cascaded integrator-comb (CIC) filter cascaded interpolated second-order polynomial (ISOP) filter are analyzed. Simulation is done to validate the usefulness of compensating attenuation in pass-band of ISOP filter on CIC filter. The conclusion is that the system employs CIC decimation filter shows advantage over the other two plans in appliance and reserving resources. A combined down-sample design that can reduce the complexity of the entire system effectively is put forward based on the three designs above in the end.","doi":"10.1109/IITA.2008.557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2008.557","startPage":"269","endPage":"273","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4739514/4739938/04740000.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4739938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Down-Sample Design under Special Condition in High-Speed All-Digital System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Down-Sample Design under Special Condition in High-Speed All-Digital System","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4740000/","accessionNumber":"10465464","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740000/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Down-Sample Design under Special Condition in High-Speed All-Digital System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3497d269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044938S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4739514","isNumber":"4739938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4739514","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4739938","articleId":"4740000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4740022,"authors":[{"name":"Chunming Li","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Chunming","lastName":"Li","id":"37557439300"},{"name":"Yanhua Diao","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Yanhua","lastName":"Diao","id":"37648516000"},{"name":"Hongtao Ma","affiliation":["Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Hongtao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37654493900"},{"name":"Yushan Li","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic CAD, Xidian university, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yushan","lastName":"Li","id":"37279901200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3497-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4740022","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":610},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Face recognition","Covariance matrix","Kernel","Independent component analysis","Feature extraction","Face detection","Lighting","Information technology","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","face recognition","image classification","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical principal component analysis method","face recognition","eigen-vectors","Bayesian rule","eigen-value","classification designer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","PCA","statistical"]}],"abstract":"The standard PCA algorithm has two mainly disadvantages: one is computing complexity, The other is it can only process the faces have the same face expression.

Virtual MIMO is examined with multi-relay cooperative communication. Performances of distributed space-time block code (DSTBC) in cooperative MIMO are analyzed and compared with general cooperative diversity protocols. Outage probability of DSTBC and pair-wise error probability (PEP) of virtual MIMO with DSTBC are derived in detail with equation expression presented. Numerical results of outage performance indicate that, DSTBC could provide full spatial diversity in two cooperative node scenario, and it outperforms other cooperative protocols such as amplify-and-forward (AF) and selection decode and forward (SDF) with the increase of cooperative nodes. Meanwhile, Monte Carlo simulation of average error performance in cooperative MIMO network reveal that, with the increase of cooperative node, DSTBC could obtain both spatial diversity gain and coded gain. In addition, higher order modulation with the increased number of relays could also enhance BER performance in cooperative MIMO network. Theoretical results are confirmed by means of simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4739514/4739938/04740075.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"639","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","doi":"10.1109/IITA.2008.320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2008.320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4739938","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Distributed Space-Time Block Code in Cooperative MIMO Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Block codes","MIMO","Relays","Protocols","Pairwise error probability","Equations","Decoding","Diversity methods","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed space-time block code","cooperative MIMO network","multirelay cooperative communication","pair-wise error probability","Monte Carlo simulation","spatial diversity","higher order modulation","BER performance","bit error rate","outage probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative MIMO network","Distributed Space-Time Block Code (DSTBC)","Outage probability","Pair-wise Error Probability (PEP)","Spatial diversity gain","Coded gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Distributed Space-Time Block Code in Cooperative MIMO Network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4740075/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10465539","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Distributed Space-Time Block Code in Cooperative MIMO Network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3497d635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076719S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4739514","isNumber":"4739938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4739514","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4739938","articleId":"4740075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4740078,"authors":[{"name":"Qiong Wang","affiliation":["The 602 Staff Room of the Second Artillery Engineering Institute, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Qiong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37577411100"},{"name":"Minli Yao","affiliation":["The 602 Staff Room of the Second Artillery Engineering Institute, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Minli","lastName":"Yao","id":"38232324900"},{"name":"Hong You","affiliation":["The 602 Staff Room of the Second Artillery Engineering Institute, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"You","id":"37651677300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3497-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4740078","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740078","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Genetic algorithms","Antenna arrays","Satellite antennas","Satellite communication","Satellite broadcasting","Vehicles","Reflector antennas","Artificial satellites","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","genetic algorithms","planar antenna arrays","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm optimization","planar phased array antenna","satellite communication","antenna beam pattern sidelobe level"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IITA.2008.338","pdfPath":"/iel5/4739514/4739938/04740078.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","startPage":"649","endPage":"652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4739938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2008.338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Genetic Algorithm Optimization in the Low Profile Phased Array Antenna for Satellite Communication on the Move","abstract":"Reducing the height of the planar phased array antenna is a key problem in satellite communication on the move.

The proposed approach and a variant were thoroughly investigated and compared with a few existing noise robustness approaches. All experiments were conducted using the Aurora-2 database and task.

OOV words are assumed to be replaced by acoustically ldquosimilarrdquo in-vocabulary (IV) words during decoding. Therefore, the first pass recognition lattice is used as the prior knowledge to adapt the vocabulary and the search space for the second pass. Vocabulary adaptation and lattice extension are performed with words similar to the hypothesis lattice words. These words are selected from a fallback vocabulary using distance functions that take the agglutinative language characteristics of Turkish into account. Morphology-based and phonetic-distance-based similarity functions respectively yield 1.9% and 4.6% absolute accuracy improvements. Statistical sub-word units are also utilized to handle the OOV problem encountered in the word-based system. Using sub-words alleviates the OOV problem and improves the recognition accuracy - OOV accuracy improved from 0% to 60.2%. However, this introduces ungrammatical items to the recognition output. Since automatically derived sub-word units do not provide explicit morphological features, the lattice extension strategy is modified to correct these ungrammatical items. Lattice extension for sub-words reduces the word error rate to 32.3% from 33.9%. This improvement is statistically significant at p=0.002 as measured by the NIST MAPSSWE significance test.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2006655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4740138/04740149.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2006655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice Extension and Vocabulary Adaptation for Turkish LVCSR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740149/","displayDocTitle":"Lattice Extension and Vocabulary Adaptation for Turkish LVCSR","volume":"17","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370234","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4740149/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice Extension and Vocabulary Adaptation for Turkish LVCSR","sourcePdf":"tasl-arisoy-2006655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079774S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4740138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4740138","articleId":"4740149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4740153,"authors":[{"name":"Junichi Yamagishi","affiliation":["Center of Speech Technology Research (CSTR), University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4740138/4740153/4740153-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junichi Yamagishi received the B.E. degree in computer science, and the M.E. and Dr.Eng. degrees in information processing from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 2002, 2003, and 2006, respectively.

Using the binaural multichannel Wiener filter (MWF), which exploits all microphone signals from both hearing aids, a significant reduction of background noise can be achieved. However, due to power and bandwidth limitations of the binaural link, it is typically not possible to transmit all microphone signals between the hearing aids. To limit the amount of transmitted information, this paper presents reduced-bandwidth MWF-based noise reduction algorithms, where a filtered combination of the contralateral microphone signals is transmitted. A first scheme uses a signal-independent beamformer, whereas a second scheme uses the output of a monaural MWF on the contralateral microphone signals and a third scheme involves an iterative distributed MWF (DB-MWF) procedure. It is shown that in the case of a rank-1 speech correlation matrix, corresponding to a single speech source, the DB-MWF procedure converges to the binaural MWF solution. Experimental results compare the noise reduction performance of the reduced-bandwidth algorithms with respect to the benchmark binaural MWF. It is shown that the best performance of the reduced-bandwidth algorithms is obtained by the DB-MWF procedure and that the performance of the DB-MWF procedure approaches quite well the optimal performance of the binaural MWF.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4740138/04740158.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"51","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2004291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2004291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Bandwidth and Distributed MWF-Based Noise Reduction Algorithms for Binaural Hearing Aids","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Hearing aids","Microphones","Iterative algorithms","Speech","Auditory system","Signal generators","Ear","Wiener filter","Background noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hearing aids","iterative methods","microphones","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microphone signals","background noise reduction","rank-1 speech correlation matrix","binaural hearing aids","multichannel Wiener filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binaural hearing aid","distributed processing","multichannel Wiener filter (MWF)","noise reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Bandwidth and Distributed MWF-Based Noise Reduction Algorithms for Binaural Hearing Aids","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370242","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Bandwidth and Distributed MWF-Based Noise Reduction Algorithms for Binaural Hearing Aids","sourcePdf":"tasl-doclo-2004291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052868S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","isNumber":"4740138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"84","articleId":"4740158","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4740278,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This elementary concept is the basis of cooperative communications. In this paper, a brief state of the art of cooperative communications is first presented. The concept is then applied to a wireless transmission scenario between an urban bus and a control centre with a relay for video surveillance applications. We consider either theoretical or realistic propagation channels: 1) Rayleigh channels on all three links, or 2) a Rice channel between the relay and the destination and a suburban channel for the other links.

For that purpose, a simplified representation of the fMRI signal is obtained by using a hierarchical clustering algorithm detecting spatial patterns of mutually correlated voxels. The general-linear model is subsequently used to determine which of the identified patterns correlates significantly to the spontaneous variations of the alpha rhythm. This strategy provides insight in the nature of resting state fMRI and reduces the number of statistical tests in the GLM correlation analysis. For all 16 subjects except one, the clustering of BOLD signal yielded very consistent regions which included areas belonging to the \u201cdefault mode\u201d network as well as the neuronal networks involved in the generation of the alpha and mu rhythms. These BOLD clusters showed much less inter-subject variability than the Alpha-BOLD statistical parametric maps obtained on a voxel-by-voxel basis. It is shown that hierarchical clustering is applicable to whole head fMRI and that it is very appropriate to obtain data reduction thereby facilitating the comparison of the results of individual subjects. The very consistent results of BOLD clustering over subjects suggests that the large inter-subject variability observed in the Alpha-BOLD statistical parametric maps is related to the individual variations in the EEG. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Brain modeling","Independent component analysis","Rhythm","Electroencephalography","Testing","Biomedical imaging","Frequency estimation","Clustering algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biomedical MRI","correlation methods","electroencephalography","image representation","medical image processing","neurophysiology","pattern clustering","statistical testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven approach","model-driven approach","inter-subject variability","resting-state brain activity","EEG-fMRI correlation patterns","signal representation","hierarchical clustering algorithm","spatial pattern detection","mutually correlated voxels","general-linear model","spontaneous alpha rhythm variation","statistical testing","BOLD signal","default mode network","neuronal networks","mu rhythms","statistical parametric maps","voxel-by-voxel basis","data reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Co-registered EEG-fMRI","hierarchical clustering","inter-subject variability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2009082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4740305/04740314.pdf","startPage":"944","endPage":"953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2009082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data and Model-Driven Approach to Explore Inter-Subject Variability of Resting-State Brain Activity Using EEG-fMRI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Data and Model-Driven Approach to Explore Inter-Subject Variability of Resting-State Brain Activity Using EEG-fMRI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740314/","volume":"2","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4740314/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10416735","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data and Model-Driven Approach to Explore Inter-Subject Variability of Resting-State Brain Activity Using EEG-fMRI","sourcePdf":"02jstsp06-jdemunck-2009082.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135517S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4740305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4740305","articleId":"4740314","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4740317,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolle M.

However, fusing information from such complementary modalities promises to provide additional insight into connectivity across brain networks and changes due to disease. We propose a data fusion scheme at the feature level using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to determine inter-subject covariations across modalities. As we show both with simulation results and application to real data, multimodal CCA (mCCA) proves to be a flexible and powerful method for discovering associations among various data types. We demonstrate the versatility of the method with application to two datasets, an fMRI and EEG, and an fMRI and sMRI dataset, both collected from patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and healthy controls. CCA results for fMRI and EEG data collected for an auditory oddball task reveal associations of the temporal and motor areas with the N2 and P3 peaks. For the application to fMRI and sMRI data collected for an auditory sensorimotor task, CCA results show an interesting joint relationship between fMRI and gray matter, with patients with schizophrenia showing more functional activity in motor areas and less activity in temporal areas associated with less gray matter as compared to healthy controls. Additionally, we compare our scheme with an independent component analysis based fusion method, joint-ICA that has proven useful for such a study and note that the two methods provide complementary perspectives on data fusion.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2008265","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4740305/04740317.pdf","startPage":"998","endPage":"1007","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2008.2008265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Canonical Correlation Analysis for Feature-Based Fusion of Biomedical Imaging Modalities and Its Application to Detection of Associative Networks in Schizophrenia","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Canonical Correlation Analysis for Feature-Based Fusion of Biomedical Imaging Modalities and Its Application to Detection of Associative Networks in Schizophrenia","volume":"2","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10416728","pubMedId":"19834573","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4740317/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Canonical Correlation Analysis for Feature-Based Fusion of Biomedical Imaging Modalities and Its Application to Detection of Associative Networks in Schizophrenia","sourcePdf":"jstsp-correa-2008265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071739S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4740305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"4740305","articleId":"4740317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4740488,"authors":[{"name":"Somaiyeh Dehghan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Somaiyeh","lastName":"Dehghan","id":"37648260500"},{"name":"Amir Masoud Rahmani","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir Masoud","lastName":"Rahmani","id":"37313847700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3496-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4740488","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740488","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Web mining","Web pages","Computer networks","Search engines","Feature extraction","Intelligent agent","Data engineering","Matrix converters","Intelligent networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification","data mining","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web content mining","classifier-CMAC neural network model","cerebellar model arithmetic computer","Web page classification","Web directory","learning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web mining","Content based web page classification","CMAC neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WIIAT.2008.328","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740404/4740405/04740488.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","startPage":"427","endPage":"431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIIAT.2008.328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Classifier-CMAC Neural Network Model for Web Mining","abstract":"The rapid growth of Web has made it a huge source of information which will make the availability of data easier and more efficient if its content is well organized.

Formal ontologies and taxonomies enrich such hierarchies further with properties and relationships but require manual effort; therefore they are costly to maintain, and often stale. Folksonomies and vocabularies lack rich category structure. Classification and extraction require the coverage of vocabularies and the alterability of folksonomies and can largely benefit from category relationships and other properties. With Doozer, a program for building conceptual models of information domains, we want to bridge the gap between the vocabularies and Folksonomies on the one side and the rich, expert-designed ontologies and taxonomies on the other. Doozer mines Wikipedia to produce tight domain hierarchies, starting with simple domain descriptions. It also adds relevancy scores for use in automated classification of information. The output model is described as a hierarchy of domain terms that can be used immediately for classifiers and IR systems or as a basis for manual or semi-automatic creation of formal ontologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10519176","htmlLink":"/document/4740498/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Growing Fields of Interest - Using an Expand and Reduce Strategy for Domain Model Extraction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Growing Fields of Interest - Using an Expand and Reduce Strategy for Domain Model Extraction","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3496a496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050668S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740404","isNumber":"4740405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740404","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4740405","articleId":"4740498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4740626,"authors":[{"name":"Budhitama Subagdja","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Centre, Nanyang Technological University, China"],"firstName":"Budhitama","lastName":"Subagdja","id":"37660902500"},{"name":"Ah-Hwee Tan","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, China"],"firstName":"Ah-Hwee","lastName":"Tan","id":"37301993200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3496-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4740626","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Subspace constraints","Intelligent agent","Computer architecture","Intelligent networks","Service oriented architecture","Computer networks","Encoding","Supervised learning","Process planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent systems","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief-desire-intention agent","self-organizing neural network architecture","multichannel network model","iFALCON","gradient encoding","sequences representation","hierarchical structures","supervised learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740626","abstract":"This paper presents iFALCON, a model of BDI (belief-desire-intention) agent that is fully realized as a self-organizing neural network architecture.

Novel techniques called gradient encoding are introduced for representing sequences and hierarchical structures to realize plans and the intention structure. This paper shows that a simplified plan representation can be encoded as weighted connections in the neural network through a process of supervised learning. A case study using the blocks world domain shows that an iFALCON agent can also do planning to solve problems when the knowledge is incomplete.","doi":"10.1109/WIIAT.2008.29","startPage":"231","endPage":"237","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIIAT.2008.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740584","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740404/4740584/04740626.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Planning with iFALCON: Towards A Neural-Network-Based BDI Agent Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740626/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Planning with iFALCON: Towards A Neural-Network-Based BDI Agent Architecture","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4740626/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10452024","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Planning with iFALCON: Towards A Neural-Network-Based BDI Agent Architecture","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3496b231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053287S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740404","isNumber":"4740584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740404","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4740584","articleId":"4740626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4740628,"authors":[{"name":"Hock Chuan Lim","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Hock Chuan","lastName":"Lim","id":"38258029200"},{"name":"Rob Stocker","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Stocker","id":"37660911000"},{"name":"Henry Larkin","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Larkin","id":"37660910100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3496-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4740628","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ethics","Object oriented modeling","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Adaptive systems","Intelligent agent","Analytical models","Context modeling","Intelligent structures","Australia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ethical aspects","social sciences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ethical trust","social moral norms simulation","bio-inspired agent","micromacro link","complex adaptive nature","social interactions","computer-based research tools","research questions","computational model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Agent Ensemble","Ethical Trust","Moral Norms"]}],"abstract":"The understanding of the micro-macro link is an urgent need in the study of social systems. The complex adaptive nature of social systems adds to the challenges of understanding social interactions and system feedback and presents substantial scope and potential for extending the frontiers of computer-based research tools such as simulations and agent-based technologies. In this project, we seek to understand key research questions concerning the interplay of ethical trust at the individual level and the development of collective social moral norms as representative sample of the bigger micro-macro link of social systems. We outline our computational model of ethical trust (CMET) informed by research findings from trust, machine ethics and neural science. Guided by the CMET architecture, we discuss key implementation ideas for the simulations of ethical trust and social moral norms.","doi":"10.1109/WIIAT.2008.184","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740404/4740584/04740628.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIIAT.2008.184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740584","startPage":"245","endPage":"251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ethical Trust and Social Moral Norms Simulation: A Bio-inspired Agent-Based Modelling Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ethical Trust and Social Moral Norms Simulation: A Bio-inspired Agent-Based Modelling Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740628/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452026","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4740628/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ethical Trust and Social Moral Norms Simulation: A Bio-inspired Agent-Based Modelling Approach","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3496b245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07095S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740404","isNumber":"4740584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740404","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4740584","articleId":"4740628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4740684,"authors":[{"name":"As'ad Salkham","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Statistics Trinity College Dublin, Distributed Systems Group, Ireland"],"firstName":"As'ad","lastName":"Salkham","id":"37062283000"},{"name":"Raymond Cunningham","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Statistics Trinity College Dublin, Distributed Systems Group, Ireland"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Cunningham","id":"37267304200"},{"name":"Anurag Garg","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Statistics Trinity College Dublin, Distributed Systems Group, Ireland"],"firstName":"Anurag","lastName":"Garg","id":"37665036200"},{"name":"Vinny Cahill","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Statistics Trinity College Dublin, Distributed Systems Group, Ireland"],"firstName":"Vinny","lastName":"Cahill","id":"37267304900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3496-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4740684","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":921},"abstract":"The high growth rate of vehicles per capita now poses a real challenge to efficient urban traffic control (UTC). An efficient solution to UTC must be adaptive in order to deal with the highly-dynamic nature of urban traffic. In the near future, global positioning systems and vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure communication may provide a more detailed local view of the traffic situation that could be employed for better global UTC optimization. In this paper we describe the design of a next-generation UTC system that exploits such local knowledge about a junction's traffic in order to optimize traffic control. Global UTC optimization is achieved using a local adaptive round robin (ARR) phase switching model optimized using collaborative reinforcement learning (CRL). The design employs an ARR-CRL-based agent controller for each signalized junction that collaborates with neighbouring agents in order to learn appropriate phase timing based on the traffic pattern. We compare our approach to non-adaptive fixed-time UTC system and to a saturation balancing algorithm in a large-scale simulation of traffic in Dublin's inner city centre. We show that the ARR-CRL approach can provide significant improvement resulting in up to ~57% lower average waiting time per vehicle compared to the saturation balancing algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740404/4740584/04740684.pdf","startPage":"560","endPage":"566","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","doi":"10.1109/WIIAT.2008.88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIIAT.2008.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Collaborative Reinforcement Learning Approach to Urban Traffic Control Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning","Traffic control","Communication system traffic control","Vehicles","Design optimization","Round robin","International collaboration","Signal design","Timing","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","road traffic","traffic control","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative reinforcement learning approach","urban traffic control optimization","global positioning systems","vehicle-to-vehicle-infrastructure communication","next-generation UTC system","junction traffic","adaptive round robin phase switching model","ARR-CRL-based agent controller","phase timing","non-adaptive fixed-time UTC system","saturation balancing algorithm","Dublin city"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reinforcement Learning","Collaborative Reinforcement Learning","Urban Traffic Control","Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Collaborative Reinforcement Learning Approach to Urban Traffic Control Optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4740684/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452081","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Collaborative Reinforcement Learning Approach to Urban Traffic Control Optimization","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"3496b560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082457S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740404","isNumber":"4740584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740404","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4740584","articleId":"4740684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4740747,"authors":[{"name":"Choochart Haruechaiyasak","affiliation":["Human Language Technology Laboratory (HLT), National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Choochart","lastName":"Haruechaiyasak","id":"37331333100"},{"name":"Wittawat Jitkrittum","affiliation":["School of Information and Computer Technology (ICT), Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology (SIIT), Thammasat University, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Wittawat","lastName":"Jitkrittum","id":"37662242800"},{"name":"Chatchawal Sangkeettrakarn","affiliation":["Human Language Technology Laboratory (HLT), National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chatchawal","lastName":"Sangkeettrakarn","id":"37598632800"},{"name":"Chaianun Damrongrat","affiliation":["Human Language Technology Laboratory (HLT), National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chaianun","lastName":"Damrongrat","id":"37427290500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3496-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4740747","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"abstract":"We propose a feature called category browsing to enhance the full-text search function of Thai-language news article search engine.

In this paper, we propose a link-based anomaly detection method that considers deviations from individual patterns by taking into account the behaviour pattern of the cluster to which the individual belongs.

Firstly, time-domain UWB channel measurements are presented to characterize the body-centric multipath channel and to facilitate the diversity analysis in a cooperative BAN (CoBAN). We focus on the system deployment scenario when the human subject is in the sitting posture. Important channel parameters such as the pathloss, power variation, power delay profile (PDP), and effective received power (ERP) crosscorrelation are investigated and statistically analyzed. Provided with the model preliminaries, a detailed analysis on the diversity level in a CoBAN is provided. Specifically, an intuitive measure is proposed to quantify the diversity gains in a single-hop cooperative network, which is defined as the number of independent multipaths that can be averaged over to detect symbols. As this measure provides the largest number of redundant copies of transmitted information through the body-centric channel, it can be used as a benchmark to access the performance bound of various diversity-based cooperative schemes in futuristic body sensor systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4740877/04740881.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Communications in Ultra-Wideband Wireless Body Area Networks: Channel Modeling and System Diversity Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740881/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Communications in Ultra-Wideband Wireless Body Area Networks: Channel Modeling and System Diversity Analysis","volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2009","accessionNumber":"10399720","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4740881/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Communications in Ultra-Wideband Wireless Body Area Networks: Channel Modeling and System Diversity Analysis","sourcePdf":"005jsac0109chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109216S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4740877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4740877","articleId":"4740881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4740884,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4740877/4740884/4740884-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuo Xiao received his B.E. from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China, in 2005, and his M.E. from the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia, in 2008.

We first present extensive empirical evidence that the wireless link quality can change rapidly in body area networks, and a fixed transmit power results in either wasted energy (when the link is good) or low reliability (when the link is bad). We quantify the potential gains of dynamic power control in body-worn devices by benchmarking off-line the energy savings achievable for a given level of reliability.We then propose a class of schemes feasible for practical implementation that adapt transmit power in real-time based on feedback information from the receiver. We profile their performance against the offline benchmark, and provide guidelines on how the parameters can be tuned to achieve the desired trade-off between energy savings and reliability within the chosen operating environment. Finally, we implement and profile our scheme on a MicaZ mote based platform, and also report preliminary results from the ultra-low-power integrated healthcare monitoring platform we are developing at Toumaz Technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Medical services","Monitoring","Wireless sensor networks","Body area networks","Feedback","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical telemetry","radio links","telecommunication congestion control","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area sensor network","dynamic radio transmit power control","continuous health monitoring","wireless link quality","body-worn devices","energy savings","offline benchmark","MicaZ mote based platform","ultra-low-power integrated healthcare monitoring platform","Toumaz Technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Body Area Sensor Network, Healthcare Monitoring","Transmission Power Control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4740877/04740884.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Power Control in Body Area Sensor Networks for Healthcare Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Power Control in Body Area Sensor Networks for Healthcare Monitoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740884/","volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4740884/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10399716","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Power Control in Body Area Sensor Networks for Healthcare Monitoring","sourcePdf":"037jsac0109xiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141057S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4740877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"4740877","articleId":"4740884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4740886,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Ghasemzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4740877/4740886/4740886-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hassan Ghasemzadeh received the B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran in 1998 and 2001 respectively.

Such systems enable on-body and mobile health-care monitoring. Our interest particularly lies in the area of movement-monitoring platforms that operate with inertial sensors. In this paper, we introduce the notion of compatibility graphs and describe how they can be utilized for power optimization. We first formulate an action coverage problem that will consider the sensing coverage from a collaborative signal processing perspective. Our solution is capable of eliminating redundant sensor nodes while maintaining the quality of service. The problem we outline can be transformed into an NP-hard problem. Therefore, we propose an ILP formulation to attain a lower bound on the solution and a fast greedy technique. Moreover, we present a system for dynamically activating and deactivating sensor nodes in real time. We then use our graph representation to develop an efficient formulation for maximum lifetime. This formulation provides sufficient information for finding activation duties for each sensor node. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on data collected from several subjects.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4740877/04740886.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4740886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Information-Driven Coverage for Physical Movement Monitoring in Body Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Body sensor networks","Patient monitoring","Legged locomotion","Wearable sensors","Batteries","Signal processing","Quality of service","Computerized monitoring","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical telemetry","health care","mobile radio","patient monitoring","quality of service","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient information-driven coverage","physical movement monitoring","body sensor networks","light-weight sensor devices","mobile health-care monitoring","movement-monitoring platforms","inertial sensors","power optimization","sensor nodes","quality of service","ILP formulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Movement Monitoring, Body Sensor Networks, Power Optimization, Information Coverage, Signal Processing, Classification "]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Information-Driven Coverage for Physical Movement Monitoring in Body Sensor Networks","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4740886/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2009","accessionNumber":"10399719","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Information-Driven Coverage for Physical Movement Monitoring in Body Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"058jsac0109ghasem.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099751S","chronDate":"January  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4740877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4740877","articleId":"4740886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4740914,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Sykes","affiliation":["SRP GE Global Research GE Multilin, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Dr. William Premerlani is employed at GE's Global Research Center in Schenectady, New York and a holder of over 20 patents.

With crack being the main distress in the actual pavement surface, digital image processing has been widely applied to cracking recognition recently. This paper presents a novel artificial neural network based pavement cracking recognition method in the area of image processing. The novelty of our approach is to utilize self-studying feature of neural network to complete the cracking identification. By converting cracking recognition to the cracking probability judgment for every sub-block image, cracking trend could be calculated, and a method for revising the neural network output is proposed to increase accuracy of identification. Actual pavement images are used to verify the performance of this method, and the results show that the surface crack could be identified correctly and automatically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4740938/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10454840","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4740938/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Recognition of Pavement Surface Crack Based on BP Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Recognition of Pavement Surface Crack Based on BP Neural Network","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"3504a019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042379S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740925","isNumber":"4740926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740925","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4740926","articleId":"4740938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":4740939,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We will select a variety of different real images of different types and test the quality of the recovered images, the recovery time, and required resources when different measurement methods with different parameters are used or when different recovering methods are applied. Then we will propose an algorithm to reduce the noise in the recovered images and sharpen them simultaneously. The algorithm exploits a well-known bilateral filtering in order to increase the confidence in margins and edges, and then uses an adaptive unsharp mask method to sharpen the images. The adaptive unsharp mask method extends the ordinary unsharp mask method and uses machine learning square loss minimization and regression in order to learn the optimal unsharping parameters. We will argue why both bilateral filtering and unsharp mask methods should be used in the algorithm simultaneously. Finally, we will show the results of applying the algorithm on real images that are recovered using the compressed sensing method and we will interpret the experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2008.119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2008.119","startPage":"66","endPage":"73","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/4741127/4741128/04741149.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4741128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiments with Compressively Sampled Images and a New Debluring-Denoising Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Experiments with Compressively Sampled Images and a New Debluring-Denoising Algorithm","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4741149/","accessionNumber":"10455036","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4741149/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments with Compressively Sampled Images and a New Debluring-Denoising Algorithm","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3454a066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055062S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4741127","isNumber":"4741128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4741127","xplore-issue":"4741128","articleId":"4741149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4741183,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Young Choi","affiliation":["Image and Video System Laboratory, Information and Communications University, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Jae Young","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405970500"},{"name":"Seungji Yang","affiliation":["Image and Video System Laboratory, Information and Communications University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungji","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292117400"},{"name":"Yong Man Ro","affiliation":["Image and Video System Laboratory, Information and Communications University, South Korea","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Yong Man","lastName":"Ro","id":"37302252100"},{"name":"Konstantinos N.

To overcome low-resolution face problem, we show that face color can significantly improve the performance compared to intensity-based features. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a new metric called dasiavariation ratio gainpsila (VRG) is proposed to theoretically prove the significance of color effect on low-resolution faces. Second, we conduct extensive performance comparison studies. In particular, 3,192 color facial images corresponding to 341 subjects, collected from three standard CMU PIE, FERET, and XM2VTSDB face databases, were used to perform comparative studies of color effect on various face resolutions. Experimental results verified that face color feature improves the degraded recognition rate due to low-resolution faces by at least an order of magnitude over intensity-based features.","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2008.22","publicationTitle":"2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/4741127/4741128/04741183.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2008.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4741128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Effect on the Face Recognition with Spatial Resolution Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4741183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4741183/","displayDocTitle":"Color Effect on the Face Recognition with Spatial Resolution Constraints","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455070","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4741183/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Effect on the Face Recognition with Spatial Resolution Constraints","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3454a294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06907S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4741127","isNumber":"4741128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4741127","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4741128","articleId":"4741183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4741186,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37599521400"},{"name":"Guy Ravitz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Ravitz","id":"37267227000"},{"name":"Mei-Ling Shyu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mei-Ling","lastName":"Shyu","id":"38320096400"},{"name":"Shu-Ching Chen","affiliation":["School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Shu-Ching","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277598000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3454-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4741186","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Classification tree analysis","Feature extraction","USA Councils","Decision trees","Bayesian methods","Association rules","Thesauri"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple correspondence analysis","correlation-based video semantic concept detection","feature-value pairs","high-level semantic concepts","multimedia research"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video semantic","Concept detection","Multiple Correspondence Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4741186","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2008.111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2008.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4741128","publicationTitle":"2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/4741127/4741128/04741186.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation-Based Video Semantic Concept Detection Using Multiple Correspondence Analysis","abstract":"Semantic concept detection has emerged as an intriguing topic in multimedia research recently. The ability to interpret high-level semantics from low-level features has been the long desired goal of many researchers.

The proposed packet-scheduling algorithm was designed for the case where streaming-server peers rely on an error recovery strategy using retransmission and application layer automatic repeat request (ARQ) rather then error protection to avoid overburdening the network resources of each server peer. To achieve channel-adaptive packet scheduling, streaming clients continue to investigate the status of each channel from multiple server peers for each group of pictures (GoP). The packet-scheduling map for the GoP that can maximize the retransmission opportunity and reduce the frame loss ratio is generated using the observed channel status from each server peer. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enhances error recovery performance in distributed stored-video streaming better than other schedulers.","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2008.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4741128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2008.26","publicationTitle":"2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/4741127/4741128/04741197.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel-Adaptive Packet Scheduler for Retransmission-Based Peer-to-Peer Stored-Video Streaming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Channel-Adaptive Packet Scheduler for Retransmission-Based Peer-to-Peer Stored-Video Streaming","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4741197/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455084","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4741197/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel-Adaptive Packet Scheduler for Retransmission-Based Peer-to-Peer Stored-Video Streaming","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3454a390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061115S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4741127","isNumber":"4741128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4741127","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4741128","articleId":"4741197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4741285,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For these modulators high voltage and high current semiconductor switches are required in order to achieve a high pulsed power. Therefore, often high power IGBT modules or IGCT devices are used. Since these devices are based on bipolar technology the switching speed is limited and the switching losses are higher. In contrast to bipolar devices unipolar ones (e.g. SiC JFETs) basically offer a better switching performance. Moreover, these devices enable high blocking voltages in case large bandgap materials as SiC are used. At the moment SiC JFET devices with a blocking voltage of 1.5 kV per JFET are available. Alternatively, the operating voltage could be increased by connecting N JFETs and a low voltage MOSFET in series resulting in a Super Cascode switch with a blocking voltage N-times higher than the blocking voltage of a single JFET. In order to evaluate the achievable switching speed of the Super Cascode and its applicability in solid state modulators, the performance of such a SiC switch is examined in this paper. Furthermore, the performance of the Super Cascode is compared with 4.5 kV IGBTs made by Powerex, which are mounted in a special low inductive housing for minimising the rise and fall times.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5kV/200ns Pulsed Power Switch based on a SiC-JFET Super Cascode","doi":"10.1109/IPMC.2008.4743658","startPage":"358","endPage":"361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPMC.2008.4743658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4743543","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Power Modulators and High-Voltage Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Power Modulators and High-Voltage Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4743542/4743543/04743658.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4743658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4743658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 May 2008","displayDocTitle":"5kV/200ns Pulsed Power Switch based on a SiC-JFET Super Cascode","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4743658/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10456270","conferenceDate":"27-31 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5kV/200ns Pulsed Power Switch based on a SiC-JFET Super Cascode","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"IPMC-00-115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073535S","chronDate":"27-31 May 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4743542","isNumber":"4743543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4743542","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4743543","articleId":"4743658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4743664,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

A new algorithm is proposed in order to detect automatically face features (eyes, mouth and nose) and extract their correspondent geometrical points. These fiducial points are described by sets of wavelet components called \"jets\" which are used for recognition. To achieve the face recognition, we propose two architectures of neural networks and we compare their performances. We also, compare the two types of features used for recognition: geometric distances and Gabor coefficients which can be used either independently or jointly. This comparison shows that Gabor coefficients are more powerful than geometric distances. We show with experimental results how the importance recognition ratio makes our system an effective tool for automatic face detection and recognition.","doi":"10.1109/IPTA.2008.4743755","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733882/4743728/04743755.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First Workshops on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","publicationTitle":"2008 First Workshops on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTA.2008.4743755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4743728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Gabor Features Extraction for Face Recognition using Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4743755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Gabor Features Extraction for Face Recognition using Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10454511","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4743755/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Gabor Features Extraction for Face Recognition using Neural Networks","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"IPTA-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059874S","chronDate":"23-26 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733882","isNumber":"4743728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733882","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4743728","articleId":"4743755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4743792,"authors":[{"name":"Jang-Hee Yoo","affiliation":["Information Security Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jang-Hee","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37292166500"},{"name":"Doosung Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Dankook University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Doosung","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37648059400"},{"name":"Ki-Young Moon","affiliation":["Information Security Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Young","lastName":"Moon","id":"37272779200"},{"name":"Mark S.

The objective is to describe in a unifying framework the most relevant methods which exploit Stein's principle to build estimators for images embedded in Gaussian noise. The appealing advantage of Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) is that it does not require a priori knowledge about the statistics of the unknown data, while yielding an estimate of the quadratic risk only depending on the statistics of the observed data. Hence, it avoids the difficult problem of the estimation of the hyperparameters of some prior distribution, which classically needs to be addressed in Bayesian methods. We begin by formulating the noise reduction problem as a problem involving the minimization of criteria derived from Stein's principle. Then, we focus on the main methods operating on linear expansions of the observed image. Both cases of non redundant and overcomplete representations are addressed. Besides, a special attention is paid to multispectral images for which there is much gain to expect in exploiting the cross-channel correlations in the denoising procedure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First Workshops on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733882/4743728/04743802.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2008 First Workshops on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications","doi":"10.1109/IPTA.2008.4743802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTA.2008.4743802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4743728","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4743802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Denoising in the Wavelet Transform Domain Based on Stein's Principle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image denoising","Wavelet domain","Wavelet transforms","Noise reduction","Gaussian noise","Yield estimation","Statistical distributions","Wiener filter","Image processing","Bayesian methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","image denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","wavelet transform","Gaussian noise","Stein unbiased risk estimate","Bayesian methods","noise reduction problem","multispectral images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gaussian noise reduction","risk estimation","Stein Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE)","wavelet transform","overcomplete basis","multichannel correlations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4743802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Image Denoising in the Wavelet Transform Domain Based on Stein's Principle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4743802/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454558","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Denoising in the Wavelet Transform Domain Based on Stein's Principle","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"IPTA-00-74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116778S","chronDate":"23-26 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733882","isNumber":"4743728","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733882","xplore-issue":"4743728","articleId":"4743802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4743817,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihong Liu","affiliation":["Intelligent Control and Robotics Research Institute, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhihong Liu","id":"37087180852"},{"name":"Zhizeng Luo","affiliation":["Intelligent Control and Robotics Research Institute, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhizeng Luo","id":"37087185271"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2510-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2511-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3616-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4743817","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Wavelet packets","Wavelet transforms","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Muscles","Prosthetic hand","Signal resolution","Time frequency analysis","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biocontrol","electromyography","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical robotics","neural nets","pattern classification","prosthetics","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hand motion pattern classifier","wavelet packet transform","electromyography","electromyographic motion pattern classifier","learning vector quantization neural network","wrist extension","wrist flexion","hand extension","hand grasp","EMG signal","forearm extensor carpi ulnaris","flexor carpi ulnaris","myoelectric hand control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4743817","abstract":"In this paper, a novel electromyographic (EMG) motion pattern classifier using wavelet packet transform (WPT) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) Neural Networks is proposed.

Crisp logic lines categorize requests into distinct priorities based on the user requirements. These prioritized channels and user requests then constitute the set of vertices V of a bi-partite graph G = (V,E), whose set of edges E represent the communication links between the channels and the users.

In this paper, we consider a particular threat called the evil twin attack, which occurs when an adversary clones an open access point and exploits common automatic access point selection techniques to trick a wireless client into associating with the malicious access point. We propose two lines of defense against this attack. First, we present an evil twin detection strategy called context-leashing based upon recording the nearby access points when first associating with an access point. Using this contextual information, the client determines if an adversary has setup an evil twin access point at a different location. Next, we propose an SSH-style authentication method called EAP-SWAT to perform one-way access point authentication that fits into the extensible authentication protocol (EAP) framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating Evil Twin Attacks in 802.11","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2008.4745081","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712735/4745069/04745081.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2008.4745081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745069","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating Evil Twin Attacks in 802.11","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745081/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454019","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating Evil Twin Attacks in 802.11","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"PCCC-00-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063625S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4712735","isNumber":"4745069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712735","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4745069","articleId":"4745081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4745093,"authors":[{"name":"An He","affiliation":["Wireless, Virginia Tech, Bradley Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"He","id":"37391100900"},{"name":"Srikathyayani Srikanteswara","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Srikathyayani","lastName":"Srikanteswara","id":"37271207000"},{"name":"Jeffrey H.

The detection and estimation become more complex if frequency hopping spread spectrum is adaptive in nature. In this paper, we propose two phase approach for detection and estimation of frequency hoping signals. Polyphase filter bank has been proposed as the architecture of choice for detection phase to efficiently detect the presence of frequency hopping signal. Based on the modeling of frequency hopping signal it can be shown that parametric methods of line spectral analysis are well suited for estimation of frequency hopping signals if the issues of order estimation and time localization are resolved. An algorithm using line spectra parameter estimation and wavelet based transient detection has been proposed which resolves above issues in computationally efficient manner suitable for implementation in cognitive radio. The simulations show promising results proving that adaptive frequency hopping signals can be detected and demodulated in a non cooperative context, even at a very low signal to noise ratio in real time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745096/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10454034","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745096/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Sensing of Adaptive Frequency Hopping signal for Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Sensing of Adaptive Frequency Hopping signal for Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"PCCC-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112746S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4712735","isNumber":"4745069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712735","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4745069","articleId":"4745096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4745099,"authors":[{"name":"Tae-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37656828600"},{"name":"Tae-Jin Lee","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277273500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3368-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3367-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-2641"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"4745099","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":808},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Frequency","Interchannel interference","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Femtocell networks","Wireless cellular systems","Indoor environments","Wireless communication","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","cellular radio","cochannel interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femto cell systems","cost-effective high-bandwidth service","wireless cellular systems","macro networks","cochannel interference","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"Femto cell systems are promising to provide cost-effective high-bandwidth service in wireless cellular systems.

In order to implement a data grid with high energy efficiency, we address in this study the issue of energy-efficient scheduling for data grids supporting real-time and data-intensive applications. Taking into account both data locations and application properties, we design a novel Distributed Energy-Efficient Scheduler (or DEES for short) that aims to seamlessly integrate the process of scheduling tasks with data placement strategies to provide energy savings. DEES is distributed in the essence - it can successfully schedule tasks and save energy without knowledge of a complete grid state. DEES encompasses three main components: energy-aware ranking, performance-aware scheduling, and energy-aware dispatching. By reducing the amount of data replications and task transfers, DEES effectively saves energy. Simulation results based on a real-world trace demonstrate that with respect to energy consumption, DEES conserves over 35% more energy than previous approaches without degrading the performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2008.4745123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745069","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712735/4745069/04745123.pdf","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Energy-Efficient Scheduling for Data-Intensive Applications with Deadline Constraints on Data Grids","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2008.4745123","startPage":"26","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745123","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Energy-Efficient Scheduling for Data-Intensive Applications with Deadline Constraints on Data Grids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745123/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10454061","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4745123/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Energy-Efficient Scheduling for Data-Intensive Applications with Deadline Constraints on Data Grids","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"PCCC-00-54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061402S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4712735","isNumber":"4745069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712735","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4745069","articleId":"4745123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4745128,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Chun Wang","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Chun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280758200"},{"name":"Chung-Wei Wang","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405905200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3368-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3367-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-2641"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"4745128","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1515},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Telecommunication traffic","Resumes","Delay","Statistics","Queueing analysis","Analytical models","Performance analysis","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","queueing theory","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum handoff","cognitive radio networks","reactive-sensing","proactive-sensing","target channel","preemptive resume priority M/G/1 queueing network model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Spectrum Handoff","Spectrum Mobility","Transmission Latency","Preemptive Priority","Preemption, queueing Theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745128","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2008.4745128","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Performance, Computing and Communications Conference","abstract":"In this paper, we will investigate the spectrum handoff schemes for the cognitive radio networks.

The other one is the proactive-sensing spectrum handoff, for which the target channel is predetermined. The advantage of the reactive spectrum handoff is the accuracy of the selected target channel, but pay the cost of sensing time. By contrast, the proactive spectrum handoff avoid the sensing time, but the pre-determined target channel may not be available.

The change over to three-phase squirrel-cage AC traction motor in electric locomotives, on inverter supply, made the traction drive most economical with high kW/kg ratio, thereby also reducing the un-sprung mass on the axle. In AC traction motor, alternative aluminium alloy rotor bars have been proposed to achieve better performance, light weight, cost reduction, and to meet the scarcity of copper to come in future. Design of rotor plays a vital role in development of torque on motor shaft. The important parameter in design of AC traction motor under inverter supply is the consideration of harmonics generated by it. In this paper, back propagation artificial neural network technique has been adopted to optimize the output design parameters of the AC traction motor rotor with aluminium alloy bars, keeping the stator design un changed. The comparison of AC traction motor with copper bars vis-vis aluminium alloy rotor bars in respect of torque developed and efficiency have been dealt in this study which present a good alternative approach in AC traction motor design.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745161","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745149","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723909/4745149/04745161.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Studies in Design of High Torque Three-Phase Squirrel-Cage AC Traction Motor with Aluminium Alloy Rotor Bars and Parameter Optimization using Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745161/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Studies in Design of High Torque Three-Phase Squirrel-Cage AC Traction Motor with Aluminium Alloy Rotor Bars and Parameter Optimization using Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745161/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10455944","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Studies in Design of High Torque Three-Phase Squirrel-Cage AC Traction Motor with Aluminium Alloy Rotor Bars and Parameter Optimization using Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"POWERCON-00-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083883S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723909","isNumber":"4745149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4745149","articleId":"4745161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4745179,"authors":[{"name":"David Coggins","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"bio":{"p":["David Coggins MIET MEng was born in Nottingham, England in September 1982.

The wind generated power is always fluctuating due to its time varying nature and causing stability problem. This weak interconnection of wind generating source in the electrical network affect the power quality and reliability. The localized energy storages shall compensate the fluctuating power and support to stabilize the weak grid. In this paper, it is proposed to control the voltage source inverter (VSI) in current control mode with energy storage, that is, batteries across the DC bus. The DC bus voltage control is obtained by using bi-directional DC/DC converter. The generated wind power can be extracted under varying wind speed and stored in the batteries. This energy storage maintains the stiff voltage across the DC bus of the voltage source inverter. The propose scheme enhances the stability and reliability of the power system. The power exchange across the wind generation and the load under dynamic situation is feasible while maintaining the power quality norms at the common point of coupling. This control strategy is evaluated on the test system under dynamic condition by using simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745219/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745219/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10456000","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy Storage to Stabilize the Weak Wind Generating Grid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Storage to Stabilize the Weak Wind Generating Grid","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"POWERCON-00-70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064576S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723909","isNumber":"4745149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723909","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4745149","articleId":"4745219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4745227,"authors":[{"name":"Manisha Dubey","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4723909/4745149/4745227/4745227-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manisha Dubey was born in Jabalpur in India on 15th December 1968.

In the proposed fuzzy expert system, generator speed deviation and acceleration are chosen as input signals to fuzzy logic power system stabilizer. In this approach gains, centers of membership functions and the parameters of the fuzzy logic controllers have been tuned using genetic algorithm. Incorporation of GA in the design of fuzzy logic power system stabilizer will add an intelligent dimension to the stabilizer and significantly reduces computational time in the design process. The problem of selection of optimal parameters of fuzzy logic power system stabilizer is converted into an optimization problem and which is solved by genetic algorithm with the integral of squared time squared error (ISTSE) based objective function. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed genetic based fuzzy logic power system stabilizer, simulation studies on multimachine system subjected to small perturbation and three-phase fault have been carried out. Simulation results show the superiority and robustness of GA based fuzzy logic power system stabilizer as compare to conventionally tuned controller.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745227","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745149","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723909/4745149/04745227.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Genetic Algorithm Based Fuzzy Logic Power System Stabilizers in Multimachine Power System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745227/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of Genetic Algorithm Based Fuzzy Logic Power System Stabilizers in Multimachine Power System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745227/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10456007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Genetic Algorithm Based Fuzzy Logic Power System Stabilizers in Multimachine Power System","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"POWERCON-00-78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084986S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723909","isNumber":"4745149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723909","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4745149","articleId":"4745227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4745235,"authors":[{"name":"Manpreet Singh Manna","affiliation":["Electrical & Instrumentation Engineering Department, Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology, Longowal, Punjab, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4723909/4745149/4745235/4745235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["M.

The main thrust in wind energy conversion system is to maintain a constant voltage at the output in spite variation in wind velocity. The Z-source inverter has been identified to exhibit in steady-state, both voltage buck and boost-capabilities. It employs a unique impedance network included between the dc power source and converter circuit. The power conversion efficiency of Z-source inverter is appreciably improved because of the traditional three-stage conversion system, consist of rectifier, boost chopper and inverter, replaced by a two stage conversion systems comprising of rectifier and Z-source inverter. All the traditional pulse width-modulation (PWM) schemes can be used to control the Z-source inverter. When the dc voltage is high enough to generate the desired ac output voltage, normal PWM is used. While the dc voltage is not enough to directly generate a desired output voltage, a modified PWM with shoot-through zero states is employed to boost voltage. The controller is designed and VHDL simulation carried out for traditional PWM as well as for the modified PWM employed with Z-source inverter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Controller Based Z-Source Inverter for Wind Turbine Driven Permanent Magnet Generator","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745265","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723909/4745149/04745265.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Controller Based Z-Source Inverter for Wind Turbine Driven Permanent Magnet Generator","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745265/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456045","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Controller Based Z-Source Inverter for Wind Turbine Driven Permanent Magnet Generator","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"POWERCON-00-116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052935S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723909","isNumber":"4745149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4745149","articleId":"4745265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4745283,"authors":[{"name":"Arghya Sarkar","affiliation":["Member, IEEE, MCKV Institute of Engineering, 243 G.

Dynamic state estimation (DSE) techniques model the time varying nature of the system, which allows it to predict the state vector in advance. This proves to be a major advantage for the operator in performing security analysis and other control center functions.

To solve this complicated problem, this paper presents an improved genetic algorithm that developed \"direct compare algorithm\" in constructing fitness function and mutation operator of simple genetic algorithm. By introducing \"infeasible area\", the improved algorithm allows individuals among the infeasible area compete with their target values. So a part of infeasible individuals with good gene can be reserved and the performance of the optimizing algorithm has been improved. At the same time, the improved algorithm designs a new mutation operator which mutates by tabu searching when the population is multiplex enough and changes its mutates way to uniform automatically when the average population multiplex lower down to a fix degree. The tabu searching mutation operator can speed up constringency of the algorithm and the uniform mutation operator can bring new gene to avoid \"premature\" of genetic algorithm.

The proposed method is tested on IEEE 30-bus system with three different generator cost curves to account for the combined cycle generating unit and valve point loading effect of a thermal generating unit. A three-phase fault at a specific transmission line is considered as a single contingency. The simulation results show that the proposed method is capable of searching for the optimal or near optimal solution of TSCOPF. Moreover, the exploitation of the neural network leads to huge computational time saving due to absence of time-domain simulation for some individuals during EP search.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745318","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723909/4745149/04745318.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary Programming Incorporating Neural Network for Transient Stability Constrained Optimal Power Flow","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic programming","Neural networks","Stability","Load flow","Power system transients","Computer networks","Computational modeling","Equations","Rotors","Fuels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined cycle power stations","evolutionary computation","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system transient stability","power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary programming","neural network","transient stability constrained optimal power flow","swing equation","rotor angle deviation","generator fuel cost minimization","objective function","IEEE 30-bus system","generator cost curves","combined cycle generating unit","valve point loading effect","thermal generating unit","three-phase fault","transmission line","time-domain simulation","EP search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evolutionary programming","neural network optimal power flow","transient stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Programming Incorporating Neural Network for Transient Stability Constrained Optimal Power Flow","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456098","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary Programming Incorporating Neural Network for Transient Stability Constrained Optimal Power Flow","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"POWERCON-00-169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071168S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723909","isNumber":"4745149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723909","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4745149","articleId":"4745318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4745324,"authors":[{"name":"D.

PSO is a powerful tool for optimizing multidimensional discontinuous nonlinearity problems. The optimization problem in power system like minimization of energy capacity of a dynamic voltage restorer is identified and analyzed in the proposed work. The growing interest in power quality has led to a variety of devices designed for mitigating power disturbances, primarily voltage sags. Among several devices, a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is a novel custom power device proposed to compensate for voltage disturbances in a distribution system. The compensation capability of a DVR depends primarily on the maximum voltage injection ability and the amount of stored energy available within the restorer. A novel PSO based phase advancement compensation (PAC) strategy is proposed in this work for optimizing the energy storage capacity of the DVR in order to enhance the voltage restoration property of the device. The proposed algorithm is tested on a sample three phase system for various levels of sag in a particular phase. The proposed algorithm identifies the required value of phase advancement angle corresponding to minimum power injection from the energy storage element such as a capacitor or a battery. The results of swarm intelligence based DVR are compared with the conventional DVR techniques and is found encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745326","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723909/4745149/04745326.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Energy Optimized Dynamic Voltage Restorer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Energy Optimized Dynamic Voltage Restorer","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10456106","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4745326/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Energy Optimized Dynamic Voltage Restorer","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"POWERCON-00-177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072812S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723909","isNumber":"4745149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4745149","articleId":"4745326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4745340,"authors":[{"name":"P.

These disturbances may cause malfunctioning of the equipments. To improve the quality of the power supply detection of the disturbance must be done accurately. In this paper DWT is employed to capture the time of transient occurrence and extract frequency features of power disturbances. These DWT coefficients when applied as inputs to the neural networks require large memory space and much learning time. Hence along with the multi resolution analysis (MRA) technique the statistical methods are used to extract the disturbance features of the distorted signal at different resolution levels. For neural network structure probabilistic neural network (PNN) and feed forward back propagation network (FFBPN) are used to classify the disturbance type and are compared. The learning efficiency of PNN is very fast when compared to FFBPN, and it is suitable for signal classification problems. Distorted signals were generated by the power system block set in MATLAB. The accuracy rate is improved using wavelets along with the statistical differentiation of the various power signal disturbances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745358/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10456138","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745358/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Power Signal Disturbances Using Wavelet Based Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Power Signal Disturbances Using Wavelet Based Neural Network","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"POWERCON-00-209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047034S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723909","isNumber":"4745149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723909","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4745149","articleId":"4745358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4745374,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The objective is to minimize the sum of squares of the L-indices subjected to limits on generator real and reactive power outputs, bus voltages, transformer taps and shunt power control devices such as SVCs. The proposed algorithm has been applied to IEEE 30-bus system to find the optimal settings of reactive power control variables. The optimal reactive power dispatch results are obtained using DE and are compared with and without flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) device such as static synchronous series compensator (SSSC).

Recently PSO is considered as realistic and powerful solution schemes to obtain the global or quasi global optimum in optimization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723909/4745149/04745385.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 Joint International Conference on Power System Technology and IEEE Power India Conference","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.2008.4745385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superiority of PSO Relay Coordination Algorithm over Non-Linear Programming: A Comparison, Review and Verification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power system protection","Power system relaying","Protective relaying","Power system interconnection","Power system reliability","Linear programming","Evolutionary computation","Particle swarm optimization","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","nonlinear programming","overcurrent protection","particle swarm optimisation","power system protection","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO relay coordination algorithm","directional over current relays","mixed integer nonlinear programming","optimization techniques","modified particle swarm optimization technique","time dial setting","protective relays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Directional over current relays","Optimization techniques","Particle swarm optimization","Power system protection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Superiority of PSO Relay Coordination Algorithm over Non-Linear Programming: A Comparison, Review and Verification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745385/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456165","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superiority of PSO Relay Coordination Algorithm over Non-Linear Programming: A Comparison, Review and Verification","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"POWERCON-00-236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066063S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723909","isNumber":"4745149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723909","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4745149","articleId":"4745385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4745400,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Irturk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Irturk","id":"37540503400"},{"name":"Bridget Benson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bridget","lastName":"Benson","id":"37391583200"},{"name":"Nikolay Laptev","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nikolay","lastName":"Laptev","id":"37645962500"},{"name":"Ryan Kastner","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kastner","id":"37266396600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2911-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3311-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4745400","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745400","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Asset management","Portfolios","Investments","High performance computing","Computer science","Constraint optimization","Concurrent computing","Software performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","financial data processing","investment","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA acceleration","Markowitz mean variance framework","optimal asset allocation","financial market","diversified asset","financial portfolio","investment opportunitiy"]}],"abstract":"Asset classes respond differently to shifts in financial markets, thus an investor can minimize the risk of loss and maximize return of his portfolio by diversification of assets. Increasing the number of diversified assets in a financial portfolio significantly improves the optimal allocation of different assets giving better investment opportunities. However, a large number of assets require a significant amount of computation that only high performance computing can currently provide. Because of the highly parallel nature of Markowitzpsila mean variance framework (the most popular approximation approach for optimal asset allocation) an FPGA implementation of the framework can also provide the performance necessary to compute the optimal asset allocation with a large number of assets. In this work, we propose an FPGA implementation of Markowitzpsila mean variance framework and show it has a potential performance ratio of 221 times over a software implementation.","publicationTitle":"2008 Workshop on High Performance Computational Finance","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Workshop on High Performance Computational Finance","pdfPath":"/iel5/4729057/4745391/04745400.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WHPCF.2008.4745400","doi":"10.1109/WHPCF.2008.4745400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA acceleration of mean variance framework for optimal asset allocation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA acceleration of mean variance framework for optimal asset allocation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745400/","conferenceDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4745400/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454092","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA acceleration of mean variance framework for optimal asset allocation","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075298S","chronDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4729057","isNumber":"4745391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4729057","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4745391","articleId":"4745400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4745432,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Step-wise and a randomized method were considered for feature subset selection, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was also used for additional dimensional reduction. Three classifiers: linear, quadratic and Mahalanobis distance were evaluated, using a k-fold like cross validation scheme. Results in the training set showed that the best performance was obtained with a 28-feature subset, using LDA and a Mahalanobis distance classifier. This model was evaluated in the test dataset with the following performance measurements global accuracy: 86%; for supraventricular beats, Sensitivity: 86%, Positive pred.: 20%; for ventricular beats Sensitivity: 71%, Positive pred.: 61%.

We applied PCA and ICA to ECG recordings of 12 and 64 leads in 5 patients in atrial fibrillation. We measured and compared between the 12 lead and 64 lead analyses the amplitude of residual ventricular QRS which remained in the separated atrial activity and the dominant fibrillatory frequency.

The advantage of a circuit graph is that it can help us to obtain an intuitive understanding of the circuit under consideration, whereas the advantage of a Boolean expression is that it is suited to various algebraic manipulations. In the literature, however, quantum circuits are mainly drawn as circuit graphs, and a formal language for quantum circuits that has a function similar to that of Boolean expressions for classical circuits is still missing. Certainly, quantum circuit graphs will become unmanageable when complicated quantum computing problems are encountered, and in particular, when they have to be solved by employing the distributed paradigm where complex quantum communication networks are involved. In this paper, we design an algebraic language for formally specifying quantum circuits in distributed quantum computing. Using this language, quantum circuits can be represented in a convenient and compact way, similar to the way in which we use Boolean expressions in dealing with classical circuits. Moreover, some fundamental algebraic laws for quantum circuits expressed in this language are established. These laws form a basis of rigorously reasoning about distributed quantum computing and quantum communication protocols.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.13","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4877616/04745631.pdf","startPage":"728","endPage":"743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4877616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.13","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algebraic Language for Distributed Quantum Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Algebraic Language for Distributed Quantum Computing","volume":"58","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10601576","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4745631/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algebraic Language for Distributed Quantum Computing","sourcePdf":"ttc2009060728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113692S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4877616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4877616","articleId":"4745631","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4745632,"authors":[{"name":"Usman R.

We validate the accuracy of our proposed lattice by investigating its performance on the 3D lid-driven cavity flow problem and show that the D3bQ15 lattice offers significant cost savings while maintaining a comparable accuracy. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method and the impact on graphics and visualization techniques via the application of line-integral convolution on 2D slices as well as the extraction of streamlines of the 3D flow.

We introduce multiple techniques to improve the culling efficiency and the overall performance of continuous collision detection. First, we present a novel formulation for continuous normal cones and use these normal cones to efficiently cull large regions of the mesh as part of self-collision tests. Second, we introduce the concept of ldquoprocedural representative trianglesrdquo to remove all redundant elementary tests between nonadjacent triangles. Finally, we exploit the mesh connectivity and introduce the concept of ldquoorphan setsrdquo to eliminate redundant elementary tests between adjacent triangle primitives. In practice, we can reduce the number of elementary tests by two orders of magnitude. These culling techniques have been combined with bounding volume hierarchies and can result in one order of magnitude performance improvement as compared to prior collision detection algorithms for deformable models. We highlight the performance of our algorithm on several benchmarks, including cloth simulations, N-body simulations, and breaking objects.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2009.12","startPage":"544","endPage":"557","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/4917472/04745636.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2009.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4917472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICCD: Interactive Continuous Collision Detection between Deformable Models Using Connectivity-Based Culling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deformable models","Charge coupled devices","Computational modeling","Automatic testing","Computer simulation","Computer science","Detection algorithms","Benchmark testing","Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mesh generation","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive continuous collision detection","deformable model","connectivity-based culling","interactive algorithm","culling efficiency","continuous normal cones","self-collision test","procedural representative triangles","nonadjacent triangle","mesh connectivity","orphan sets","bounding volume hierarchies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous collision detection","deformable models","continuous normal cones","orphan set","self-collision","bounding volume hierarchies."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"ICCD: Interactive Continuous Collision Detection between Deformable Models Using Connectivity-Based Culling","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4745636/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2009","accessionNumber":"10630974","pubMedId":"19423880","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICCD: Interactive Continuous Collision Detection between Deformable Models Using Connectivity-Based Culling","sourcePdf":"ttg2009040544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10221S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"4917472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4917472","articleId":"4745636","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4745641,"authors":[{"name":"Chaua C.

The proposed method uses a simulated annealing-based approach (SA) for range image registration with the surface interpenetration measure (SIM), as similarity measure, in order to match two face images. The authentication score is obtained by combining the SIM values corresponding to the matching of four different face regions: circular and elliptical areas around the nose, forehead, and the entire face region. Then, a modified SA approach is proposed taking advantage of invariant face regions to better handle facial expressions. Comprehensive experiments were performed on the FRGC v2 database, the largest available database of 3D face images composed of 4,007 images with different facial expressions. The experiments simulated both verification and identification systems and the results compared to those reported by state-of-the-art works. By using all of the images in the database, a verification rate of 96.5 percent was achieved at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.1 percent. In the identification scenario, a rank-one accuracy of 98.4 percent was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest rank-one score ever achieved for the FRGC v2 database when compared to results published in the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5370684/04745641.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5370684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Face Recognition Using Simulated Annealing and the Surface Interpenetration Measure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Simulated annealing","Image databases","Face detection","Image registration","Authentication","Nose","Forehead","Lighting","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image matching","image registration","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face recognition","simulated annealing","surface interpenetration measure","range image registration","similarity measure","face image","authentication score","SIM value","face region matching","circular area","elliptical area","facial expression","FRGC v2 database","verification system","identification system","false acceptance rate","rank-one accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D face recognition","Surface Interpenetration Measure (SIM)","range image registration."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artifacts","Biometric Identification","Computer Simulation","Databases, Factual","Face","Humans","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Principal Component Analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"3D Face Recognition Using Simulated Annealing and the Surface Interpenetration Measure","volume":"32","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4745641/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11049966","pubMedId":"20075453","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Face Recognition Using Simulated Annealing and the Surface Interpenetration Measure","sourcePdf":"ttp2010020206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098469S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5370684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"5370684","articleId":"4745641","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4745652,"authors":[{"name":"Eric W.

Small unmanned aircraft systems have the potential to create new applications and markets in civil domains, enable many disruptive technologies, and put considerable stress on air traffic control systems. We argue that of the existing networked communication architectures, only meshed ad hoc networking can meet the communication demands for the large number of small aircraft expected to be deployed in future. Experimental results using the heterogeneous unmanned aircraft system are presented to show that meshed airborne communication is feasible, that it extends the operational envelope of small unmanned aircraft at the expense of increased communication variability, and that net-centric operation of multiple cooperating aircraft is possible. Additionally, the ability of airborne networks of small unmanned aircraft to exploit controlled mobility to improve performance is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","volume":"96","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10401570","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4745652/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Airborne Communication Networks for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Airborne Communication Networks for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems","sourcePdf":"jproc-frew-2006127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101781S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4745645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"4745645","articleId":"4745652","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4745679,"authors":[{"name":"Kentaro Sano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, JAPAN"],"lastName":"Kentaro Sano","id":"37086906012"},{"name":"Luzhou Wang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Luzhou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085964395"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Hatsuda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, JAPAN"],"lastName":"Yoshiaki Hatsuda","id":"37086906191"},{"name":"Satoru Yamamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, JAPAN"],"lastName":"Satoru Yamamoto","id":"37086905731"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2826-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-7945"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-7953"}],"articleNumber":"4745679","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":201},"abstract":"For numerical computations requiring a relatively high ratio of data access to operation, the scalability of memory bandwidth is key to performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a scalable FPGA-array to achieve custom computing machines for high-performance and power-efficient scientific simulations based on difference schemes. With the FPGA-array, we construct a systolic computational-memory array (SCMA) by homogeneously partitioning the SCMA among multiple tightly-coupled FPGAs. A large SCMA implemented using a lot of FPGAs achieves high-performance computation with scalable memory-bandwidth and scalable arithmetic-performance according to the array size. For feasibility demonstration and quantitative evaluation, we design and implement the SCMA of 192 processing elements over two ALTERA StratixII FPGAs. The implemented SCMA running at 106 MHz achieves the sustained performances of 32.8 to 36.5 GFlops in single precision for three benchmark computations while the peak performance is 40.7 GFlops. In comparison with a 3.4GHz Pentium4 processor, the SCMAs consume 70% to 87% power and require only 3% to 7% energy consumption for the same computations. Based on the requirement model for inter-FPGA bandwidth, we illustrate that SCMAs are completely scalable for the currently available high-end to low-end FPGAs, while the SCMA implemented with the two FPGAs demonstrates the doubled performance of that by the single-FPGA SCMA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Bandwidth","Computational modeling","High performance computing","Scalability","Microprocessors","Computational fluid dynamics","Energy consumption","Partial differential equations","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","finite difference methods","mathematics computing","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable FPGA-array","power-efficient computation","difference schemes","power-efficient scientific simulations","systolic computational-memory array","scalable memory-bandwidth","scalable arithmetic-performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745679","doi":"10.1109/HPRCTA.2008.4745679","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Workshop on High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4729054/4745673/04745679.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPRCTA.2008.4745679","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745673","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Workshop on High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Technology and Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable FPGA-array for high-performance and power-efficient computation based on difference schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scalable FPGA-array for high-performance and power-efficient computation based on difference schemes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745679/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745679/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456934","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable FPGA-array for high-performance and power-efficient computation based on difference schemes","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084426S","chronDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4729054","isNumber":"4745673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4729054","xplore-issue":"4745673","articleId":"4745679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4745680,"authors":[{"name":"Dave Strenski","affiliation":["Cray, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Strenski","id":"37662098600"},{"name":"Jim Simkins","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., Ireland"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Simkins","id":"37662099600"},{"name":"Richard Walke","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., Ireland"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Walke","id":"37271862600"},{"name":"Ralph Wittig","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., Ireland"],"firstName":"Ralph","lastName":"Wittig","id":"37353158600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2826-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-7945"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-7953"}],"articleNumber":"4745680","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Microprocessors","Digital signal processing","Clocks","Logic devices","Table lookup","Programming profession","Application specific integrated circuits","Fabrics","Size control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","floating-point peak performance","field programmable gate arrays","embedded processing circuits","application specific integrated circuit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745680","abstract":"Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been available for more than 25 years.

HPRCs have been shown to provide good speedups and good cost/performance ratios, but not necessarily ease of use, leading to a slow acceptance of this technology. HPRCs introduce new design challenges, such as the lack of portability across platforms, incompatibilities with legacy code, users reluctant to change their code base, a prolonged learning curve, and the need for a system-level hardware/software co-design development flow. This paper presents the evolution and current work on TMD-MPI, which started as an MPI-based programming model for multiprocessor systems-on-chip implemented in FPGAs, and has now evolved to include multiple X86 processors. TMD-MPI is shown to address current design challenges in HPRC usage, suggesting that the MPI standard has enough syntax and semantics to program these new types of parallel architectures. Also presented is the TMD-MPI ecosystem, which consists of research projects and tools that are developed around TMD-MPI to further improve HPRC usability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Workshop on High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4729054/4745673/04745682.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Workshop on High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Technology and Applications","doi":"10.1109/HPRCTA.2008.4745682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPRCTA.2008.4745682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPI as an abstraction for software-hardware interaction for HPRCs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","High performance computing","Microprocessors","Costs","Hardware","Software systems","Genetic programming","Multiprocessing systems","Parallel architectures","Ecosystems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","message passing","parallel architectures","reconfigurable architectures","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPI","software-hardware interaction","HPRC","high performance reconfigurable computers","microprocessors","reconfigurable FPGA","multiprocessor systems-on-chip","parallel architectures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"MPI as an abstraction for software-hardware interaction for HPRCs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745682/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456937","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPI as an abstraction for software-hardware interaction for HPRCs","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110252S","chronDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4729054","isNumber":"4745673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4729054","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4745673","articleId":"4745682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4745683,"authors":[{"name":"Esam El-Araby","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), ECE Department, George Washington University, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Esam","lastName":"El-Araby","id":"38276822300"},{"name":"Ivan Gonzalez","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), ECE Department, George Washington University, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Gonzalez","id":"37277040700"},{"name":"Tarek El-Ghazawi","affiliation":["NSF Center for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), ECE Department, George Washington University, Washington D.C., DC, USA"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"El-Ghazawi","id":"38192796200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2826-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-7945"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-7953"}],"articleNumber":"4745683","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":449},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource virtualization","Field programmable gate arrays","Microprocessors","Concurrent computing","Runtime","High performance computing","Hardware","Coprocessors","Platform virtualization","Permission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","parallel architectures","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable resources","high-performance reconfigurable computing systems","parallel computers","FPGA chips","Cray XT5h","Cray XD1","single-program multiple-data model","asymmetric distribution","reconfigurable processors","SPMD programming model","partial run-time reconfiguration","microprocessors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Performance Computing","Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)","Reconfigurable Computing","Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration"]}],"abstract":"High-performance reconfigurable computers (HPRCs) are parallel computers but with added FPGA chips.

The execution of parallel applications on HPRCs mainly follows the single-program multiple-data (SPMD) model, which is largely the case in traditional high-performance computers (HPCs). In addition, the prevailing usage of FPGAs in such systems has been as co-processors. The overall system resources, however, are often underutilized because of the asymmetric distribution of the reconfigurable processors relative to the conventional processors. This asymmetry is often a challenge for using the SPMD programming model on these systems. In this work, we propose a resource virtualization solution based on partial run-time reconfiguration (PRTR). This technique will allow sharing the reconfigurable processors among the underutilized processors. We will present our virtualization infrastructure augmented with an analytical investigation. We will verify our proposed concepts with experimental implementations using the Cray XD1 as a testbed. It will be shown that this approach is quite promising and will allow full exploitation of the system resources with fair sharing of the reconfigurable processors among the microprocessors.

Maxwell consists of 32 IBM Intel Xeon blades each hosting two Virtex-4 FPGA nodes through PCI-X interface. Real hardware implementation of our FPGA-based quasi-Monte Carlo engine on the Maxwell machine outperforms equivalent software implementations running on the Xeon processors by 3 orders of magnitude, with the speed-up figure scaling linearly with the number of processing nodes.

Given the intense competition from multicore, and from other types of accelerators, there is now a question whether MD on HPRC can be competitive. We concentrate here on the MD kernel computation-determining the force between short-range particle pairs-and examine it in detail to find the performance limits under current technology and methods. We systematically explore the design space of the force pipeline with respect to arithmetic algorithm, arithmetic mode, precision, and various other optimizations. We examine simplifications that are possible if the end-user is willing to trade off simulation quality for performance. And we use the new Altera floating point cores and compiler to further optimize the designs. We find that for the Stratix-III, and for the best (as yet unoptimized) single precision designs, 11 pipelines running at 250 MHz can fit on the FPGA. If a significant fraction of this potential performance can be maintained in a full implementation, then HPRC MD should be highly competitive.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance potential of molecular dynamics simulations on high performance reconfigurable computing systems","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Workshop on High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Technology and Applications","doi":"10.1109/HPRCTA.2008.4745685","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Workshop on High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4729054/4745673/04745685.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPRCTA.2008.4745685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance potential of molecular dynamics simulations on high performance reconfigurable computing systems","conferenceDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745685/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456940","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance potential of molecular dynamics simulations on high performance reconfigurable computing systems","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091295S","chronDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4729054","isNumber":"4745673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4729054","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4745673","articleId":"4745685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4745686,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This shift might have triggered the evolution of von Neumann architecture towards a parallel processing paradigm. Cellular Automata- inherently decentralized spatially extended systems consisting of large numbers of simple and identical components with local connectivity, also proposed by von Neumann in 1950s, is the potential candidate among the parallel processing alternatives. The spatial parallelism available on field programmable gate arrays make them the ideal platform to investigate the cellular automata systems as potential parallel processing paradigm on multicore architectures. The authors have been experimenting with this idea for quite some time now and report their progress from a single to a dual FPGA chip based cellular automata accelerator implementation. For D2Q9 Lattice Boltzmann method implementation, we were able to achieve an overall speed-up of 2.3 by moving our Fortran implementation to our single FPGA-based implementations. Further, with our dual FPGA-based implementation, we achieved a speed-up close to 1.8 compared to our single FPGA-based implementation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Parallel processing","Computational modeling","Content addressable storage","Multicore processing","Computer architecture","Lattice Boltzmann methods","Biological system modeling","Logic","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","FORTRAN","lattice Boltzmann methods","multivariable systems","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point","cellular automata","dual FPGA-enabled system","multicore computing","von Neumann architecture","parallel processing paradigm","decentralized spatially extended systems","field programmable gate arrays","D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann method","Fortran implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745686","doi":"10.1109/HPRCTA.2008.4745686","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Workshop on High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4729054/4745673/04745686.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPRCTA.2008.4745686","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745673","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Workshop on High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Technology and Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Floating point based Cellular Automata simulations using a dual FPGA-enabled system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Floating point based Cellular Automata simulations using a dual FPGA-enabled system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745686/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745686/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456941","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Floating point based Cellular Automata simulations using a dual FPGA-enabled system","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085585S","chronDate":"16-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4729054","isNumber":"4745673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4729054","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4745673","articleId":"4745686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4745709,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The base-band behavioral models of the HPAs are based on the Parallel Hammerstein approach, while the digital predistorter (DPD) is extracted employing the nonlinear autoregressive scheme with exogenous inputs. For the DPA with a W-CDMA signal with 3.5 dB Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR), the predistorter is capable of a 10 dB ACPR reduction, without decreasing the average efficiency, but the DPD effectiveness quickly degrades with high PAPR signals and back-off levels. Different behavior is observed for the LPA where the increase of the PAPR do not affect the DPD effectiveness. While fed with an extremely demanding W-CDMA 3GPP standard, the amelioration of the overall HPA performance in terms of back-off and efficiency are better than 10 dB of back-off and better than 15% concerning the average efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/INMMIC.2008.4745731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMMIC.2008.4745731","startPage":"119","endPage":"122","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Workshop on Integrated Nonlinear Microwave and Millimetre-Wave Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740201/4745688/04745731.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Workshop on Integrated Nonlinear Microwave and Millimetre-Wave Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Base-band predistortion linearization scheme of high efficiency power amplifiers for wireless applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Base-band predistortion linearization scheme of high efficiency power amplifiers for wireless applications","conferenceDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745731/","accessionNumber":"10454795","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745731/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base-band predistortion linearization scheme of high efficiency power amplifiers for wireless applications","confLoc":"Malaga, Spain","sourcePdf":"SPI-01062009-00043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04111S","chronDate":"24-25 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740201","isNumber":"4745688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740201","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4745688","articleId":"4745731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4745733,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Bidirectional dc-dc converters may be isolated or nonisolated depending on the application. A new soft-switched bidirectional dc-dc converter will be proposed in this letter. The proposed converter can operate with soft switching, a continuous inductor current, fixed switching frequency, and the switch stresses of a conventional pulsewidth modulation converter regardless of the direction of power flow. These features are due to a very simple auxiliary active clamp circuit that is operational regardless of the direction of power flow.

Indeed, simplifying assumptions on the sequences of modes are usually adopted, also in order to obtain averaged models and discrete-time maps. In this paper, we show how the complementarity framework can be used to represent complete switched models of a wide class of power converters, with EDs having characteristics represented by piecewise-affine (even complicated) relations. The model equations can be written in an easy and compact way without the enumeration of all converter modes, eventually formalizing the procedure to an algorithm. The complementarity model can be used to perform transient simulations and time-domain analysis. Mathematical tools coming from nonlinear programming allow to simulate numerically the transient behavior of even complex power converters. Also rigorous time-domain analysis is possible without excluding pathological situations like, for instance, inconsistent initial conditions and simultaneous switchings. Basic converter topologies are used as examples to show the construction procedure for the complementarity models and their usefulness for simulating the dynamic evolution also for nontrivial operating conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Perspective for Modeling Power Electronics Converters: Complementarity Framework","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2007420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4783511/04745756.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2007420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745756/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Perspective for Modeling Power Electronics Converters: Complementarity Framework","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4745756/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475292","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Perspective for Modeling Power Electronics Converters: Complementarity Framework","sourcePdf":"tpel-vasca-2007420.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141812S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4783511","articleId":"4745756","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4745757,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Sen Tang","affiliation":["Automation College, ChongQing University, ChongQing, China","The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4783511/4745757/4745757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun Sen Tang (S'08) received the B.E. degree in 2004 from the Automation College, ChongQing University, ChongQing, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is a Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.

A solution to this problem is proposed using recent complex extensions of EMD which guarantees the same number of decomposition levels, that is the uniqueness of the scales.

A closed-expression for a mutual coupling compensation matrix (MCCM) is derived. The MCCM is used to compensate the presence of the real individual elements' patterns and the interelement MC effects for any excitations obtained with an isotropic-based pattern synthesis method. The MCCM is calculated from the generalized scattering matrix (GSM) of an antenna array and the spherical mode expansion (SME) of its radiated field. For a given array, this MCCM has to be calculated only once since it only depends on the radiating and scattering characteristics of the antenna elements as well as on their location in the array. Conditions regarding null field pattern directions can also be reinforced in the MCCM. To compute the GSM of the array and the SME of the radiated field, a validated full-wave hybrid and modular methodology is used. Numerical results of synthesized patterns where the MC effects have been compensated are presented for arrays made up of dielectric resonator antennas. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2008.2012276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4808186/04745777.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"111","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2008.2012276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Coupling Compensation in Arrays Using a Spherical Wave Expansion of the Radiated Field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2009","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Coupling Compensation in Arrays Using a Spherical Wave Expansion of the Radiated Field","volume":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4745777/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2009","accessionNumber":"10624644","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745777/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Coupling Compensation in Arrays Using a Spherical Wave Expansion of the Radiated Field","sourcePdf":"lawp-corcoles-2012276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082427S","chronDate":"2009","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4808186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4808186","articleId":"4745777","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":4745780,"authors":[{"name":"Juan F.

The multipath model is developed by first extracting the relevant multipath cluster characteristics from measured indoor channel data and subsequently capturing these characteristics in an autoregressive stochastic model. This model is then used to generate channel matrices whose space-time characteristics closely match those of realistic scenarios, particularly when birth and death of multipath clusters are included in the stochastic representation. Computational examples reveal the applicability and the accuracy of the approach. While the current implementation is based on data taken assuming that propagation is confined to the horizontal plane, this paper also discusses the extension of the model to describe 3-D propagation, enabling its application to a wide range of physical scenarios and antenna characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2012431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5062310/04745785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2012431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062310","startPage":"2618","endPage":"2625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stochastic Model of the Time-Variant MIMO Channel Based on Experimental Observations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Stochastic Model of the Time-Variant MIMO Channel Based on Experimental Observations","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10712988","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4745785/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stochastic Model of the Time-Variant MIMO Channel Based on Experimental Observations","sourcePdf":"tvt-jensen-2012431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077748S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4745785","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4745786,"authors":[{"name":"Romero Leandro Andersen","affiliation":["Power Electronics Institute, Department of the Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4783511/4745786/4745786-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Romero Leandro Andersen was born in Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil, in 1980.

This converter uses a high-frequency three-phase transformer that provides galvanic isolation between the power source and the load. The three active switches are connected to the same reference, which simplifies the gate drive circuitry. Reduction of the input current ripple and the output voltage ripple is achieved by means of an inductor and a capacitor, whose volumes are smaller than in equivalent single-phase topologies. The three-phase DC-DC conversion also helps in loss distribution, allowing the use of lower cost switches. These characteristics make this converter suitable for applications where low-voltage power sources are used and the associated currents are high, such as in fuel cells, photovoltaic arrays, and batteries. The theoretical analysis, a simplified design example, and the experimental results for a 1-kW prototype will be presented for two operation regions. The prototype was designed for a switching frequency of 40 kHz, an input voltage of 120 V, and an output voltage of 400 V.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Prototypes","Voltage","DC-DC power converters","Phase transformers","Galvanizing","Switching circuits","Inductors","Capacitors","Circuit topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","power transformers","switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase current-fed push-pull DC-DC converter","high-frequency three-phase transformer","galvanic isolation","active switches","gate drive circuitry","inductor","capacitor","single-phase topologies","fuel cells","photovoltaic arrays","batteries","switching frequency","frequency 40 kHz","power 1 kW","voltage 120 V","voltage 400 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC\u2013DC power conversion","HF transformers","multiphase","ripple reduction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2007727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4783511/04745786.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2007727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Phase Current-Fed Push\u2013Pull DC\u2013DC Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Phase Current-Fed Push\u2013Pull DC\u2013DC Converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745786/","volume":"24","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745786/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10475285","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Phase Current-Fed Push\u2013Pull DC\u2013DC Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-andersen-2007727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062538S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4783511","articleId":"4745786","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4745787,"authors":[{"name":"Phatiphat Thounthong","affiliation":["Department of Teacher Training in Electrical Engineering (TE), King Mongkut''s University of Technology North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/4785258/4745787/4745787-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Phatiphat Thounthong (M'09) received the B.S. and M.E. degrees from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology North Bangkok (KMITNB), Bangkok, Thailand, in 1996 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine (INPL), Nancy-Lorraine, France, in 2005, all in electrical engineering.","From 1997 to 1998, he was an Electrical Engineer with E.R.

Compared to the traditional Z-source inverter, it can reduce the Z-source capacitor voltage stress significantly to perform the same voltage boost, and has inherent limitation to inrush current at startup. The control strategy of the proposed Z-source inverter is exactly the same as the traditional one, so all the existing control strategy can be used directly. A soft-start strategy is also proposed to suppress the inrush surge and the resonance of Z-source capacitors and inductors. The operation principle of the proposed topology and comparison with the traditional topology are analyzed in detail. Simulation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the new features of the improved topology.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4783511/04745792.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2006173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2006173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Z-Source Inverter With Reduced Z-Source Capacitor Voltage Stress and Soft-Start Capability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Capacitors","Voltage","Stress","Surges","Resonance","Inductors","Power conversion","Network topology","Circuit topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","power capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved Z-source inverter","Z-source capacitor voltage stress reduction","soft-start capability","inrush current","control strategy","Z-source inductors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inrush current","soft start","Z-source inverter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved Z-Source Inverter With Reduced Z-Source Capacitor Voltage Stress and Soft-Start Capability","volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4745792/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475286","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Z-Source Inverter With Reduced Z-Source Capacitor Voltage Stress and Soft-Start Capability","sourcePdf":"tpel-tang-2006173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112609S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"251","xplore-issue":"4783511","articleId":"4745792","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":4745793,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet M.

The main output voltage is controlled by the master converter, while the input voltages and output currents are controlled and balanced by the slave converter. The ISOP topology has two important advantages, namely the use of two series-connected rated for lower voltage converters gives a significant reduction of the switch-mode power supply overall cost and size, and loss free balancing of the voltages of the input serially connected filter capacitors. The proposed solution is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified on a laboratory setup. The experimental results are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2008.2006975","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4783511/04745797.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2008.2006975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783511","startPage":"316","endPage":"328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Master/Slave Control of Input-Series- and Output-Parallel-Connected Converters: Concept for Low-Cost High-Voltage Auxiliary Power Supplies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Master/Slave Control of Input-Series- and Output-Parallel-Connected Converters: Concept for Low-Cost High-Voltage Auxiliary Power Supplies","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475287","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4745797/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Master/Slave Control of Input-Series- and Output-Parallel-Connected Converters: Concept for Low-Cost High-Voltage Auxiliary Power Supplies","sourcePdf":"tpel-grbovic-2006975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072495S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"4783511","articleId":"4745797","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4745800,"authors":[{"name":"Faisal H.

By virtue of the modular nature of the converter, it is possible to integrate multiple loads and sources with the converter at the same time. The modular construction of the MMCCC topology provides autotransformer-like taps in the circuit, and depending on the conversion ratio of the converter, it becomes possible to connect several dc sources and loads at these taps. The modularity of the new converter is not limited to only this dc transformer (auto) like operation, but also provides redundancy and fault bypass capability in the circuit. Using the modularity feature, some redundant modules can be operated in bypass state, and during some faults, these redundant modules can be used to replace a faulty module to maintain an uninterrupted operation. Moreover, by obtaining a flexible conversion ratio, the MMCCC converter can transfer power in both directions. Thus, this MMCCC topology could be a solution to establish a power management system among multiple sources and loads having different operating voltages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4745800/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475262","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Load\u2013Source Integration in a Multilevel Modular Capacitor-Clamped DC\u2013DC Converter Featuring Fault Tolerant Capability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Load\u2013Source Integration in a Multilevel Modular Capacitor-Clamped DC\u2013DC Converter Featuring Fault Tolerant Capability","sourcePdf":"tpel-tolbert-2006055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079062S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4783510","articleId":"4745800","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4745802,"authors":[{"name":"Liangyong Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5200775/4745802/4745802-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liangyong Wang received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in control theory and engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2001 and 2004, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Ministry of Education, and the Research Center of Automation.","His current research interests are robotics, adaptive control, nonlinear control, and neural networks."]},"firstName":"Liangyong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539351700"},{"name":"Tianyou Chai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5200775/4745802/4745802-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Tianyou Chai (F'08) received the Ph.D. degree in control theory and engineering from the Northeastern University of Technology, Shenyang, China, in 1985.","He is currently a Professor and the Head of the Research Center of Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, and he is also the Director of the Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Ministry of Education, Northeastern University.

The proposed terminal SMC (TSMC) alleviates some main drawbacks (such as contradiction between control efforts in the transient and tracking errors in the steady state) in the linear SMC while maintains its robustness to the uncertainties. Moreover, an indirect method is developed to avoid the singularity problem in the initial TSMC. In the proposed control scheme, a radial basis function neural network (NN) is adopted to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of the robotic manipulator. Meanwhile, a robust control term is added to suppress the modeling error and estimate the error of the NN. Finite time convergence and stability of the closed loop system can be guaranteed by Lyapunov theory. Finally, the proposed control scheme is applied to a robotic manipulator.

Over the last years, various topics related to the extension of the classical control schemes to these specifics drives have been covered in depth in literature, such as vector control of a six-phase induction machine with two sets of three-phase stator windings spatially shifted by 30 electrical degrees (also called asymmetrical dual three-phase ac machine). In this paper, a model-based predictive control (MBPC) for the current regulation of asymmetrical dual three-phase AC machines is analyzed. MBPC overcomes the difficulties of multiphase current control, avoiding complex controllers and modulation techniques, but at the expense of an increased computational cost. Simulation results are provided to examine the potential of the control method. The influence of the number of voltage vectors considered to evaluate the predictive model is studied, and different cost functions are analyzed. The computation time needed for the implementation of the control method is discussed to prove its real-time feasibility. Finally, experimental results are given to illustrate the capability of the control method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2011604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5062301/04745806.pdf","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2011604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Proof of Concept Study of Predictive Current Control for VSI-Driven Asymmetrical Dual Three-Phase AC Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745806/","displayDocTitle":"A Proof of Concept Study of Predictive Current Control for VSI-Driven Asymmetrical Dual Three-Phase AC Machines","volume":"56","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10697931","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745806/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proof of Concept Study of Predictive Current Control for VSI-Driven Asymmetrical Dual Three-Phase AC Machines","sourcePdf":"tie-barrero-2011604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117193S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5062301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"5062301","articleId":"4745806","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4745808,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Chiang Hua","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Douliou, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4897610/4745808/4745808-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chih-Chiang Hua (S'91\u2013M'92) was born in 1962.

The proposed current-control method adopts a variable sampling point scheme for inductor current sensing. It is able to avoid the switching noise caused by the turn-on or turn-off of power devices. The measured value of the inductor current is used to estimate the inverter output voltage at the next switching period with a simple linear extrapolation to force the output current to follow the current reference. Compared to the conventional predictive current controllers, the proposed control features are as follows: (1) only the inductor current measurement is required, and it is able to achieve a cost-effective and less-complex circuit (the output voltage and current measurements are required for a conventional controller) and (2) the proposed variable sampling technique is designed to avoid the switching noise, thus a robust current-control system can be achieved. Finally, a seven-level cascaded inverter with three DC-AC converter modules was constructed and tested.

The proper alignment is achieved by adjusting the normalization gain used to synthesize the predistortion function. The dependencies of the linearity and power efficiency of the linearized amplifier upon the gain normalization factor are investigated, and it is shown that the efficiency of the linearized amplifier is almost unaffected by variation of the normalization gain. Conversely, the linearity performance of the linearized power amplifier is found to be dependent on the gain normalization factor, as a consequence of the average power variation through the predistorter. Indeed, the proper power alignment of the predistorter following an adequate choice of the normalization gain shows a significant improvement in the measured adjacent channel power ratio at the linearized amplifier output.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Linearity","Predistortion","High power amplifiers","Performance gain","OFDM","Multiaccess communication","Linearization techniques","Power engineering and energy","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearisation techniques","optimisation","power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power alignment issue","digital predistortion function","linearized power amplifier","linear optimization","gain normalization factor","adjacent channel power ratio measurement","radiofrequency power amplifier","wireless communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion","look-up tables","nonlinearity","power amplifier","small-signal gain"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBC.2008.2006652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/4787240/04745809.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4787240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2008.2006652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Alignment of Digital Predistorters for Power <newline/>Amplifiers Linearity Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Alignment of Digital Predistorters for Power <newline/>Amplifiers Linearity Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745809/","volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745809/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10477226","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Alignment of Digital Predistorters for Power <newline/>Amplifiers Linearity Optimization","sourcePdf":"tbc-hammi-2006652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032857S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"4787240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4787240","articleId":"4745809","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4745811,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A sudden change in active load will cause both a phase jump and a magnitude fluctuation in the bus voltage (voltage at the PCC), whereas reactive load changes mainly affect the voltage magnitude. With the addition of energy storage to a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM), it is possible to compensate for the active power change as well as providing reactive power support. In this paper effective active power compensation schemes are proposed.

In this and other areas of manufacturing and materials handling, these legacy automation technologies are increasingly limiting for the growing demand for systems that are reconfigurable, fault tolerant, and easy to maintain. IEC 61499 Function Blocks is an emerging architectural framework for the design of distributed industrial automation systems and their reusable components. A number of architectures have been suggested for multiagent and holonic control systems that incorporate function blocks. This paper presents a multiagent control approach for a baggage handling system (BHS) using IEC 61499 Function Blocks. In particular, it focuses on demonstrating a decentralized control system that is scalable, reconfigurable, and fault tolerant. The design follows the automation object approach, and produces a function block component representing a single section of conveyor. In accordance with holonic principles, this component is autonomous and collaborative, such that the structure and the behavior of a BHS can be entirely defined by the interconnection of these components within the function block design environment. Simulation is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the agent-based control system and a utility is presented for real-time viewing of these systems. Tests on a physical conveyor test system demonstrated deployment to embedded control hardware.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2008.2007216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/5443442/04745827.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2008.2007216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443442","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Component-Based Automation of Baggage Handling Systems With IEC 61499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Component-Based Automation of Baggage Handling Systems With IEC 61499","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745827/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745827/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11220571","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Component-Based Automation of Baggage Handling Systems With IEC 61499","sourcePdf":"tase-vvyatkin-2007216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071569S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"5443442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5443442","articleId":"4745827","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":4745829,"authors":[{"name":"Janne P.

The PA operated at 2.26 GHz and delivered 20.4-dBm output power with peak drain efficiency (DE) of 65% and power gain of 12 dB. Broadband performance was achieved across a 300-MHz bandwidth with DE of better than 50% and 1-dB output-power flatness. The concept of enhanced injection predistortion with a capability to selectively suppress unwanted sub-frequency components and hence suitable for memory effects minimization is described coupled with a new technique that facilitates an accurate measurement of the phase of the third-order intermodulation (IM3) products. A robust iterative computational algorithm proposed in this paper dispenses with the need for manual tuning of amplitude and phase of the IM3 injected signals as commonly employed in the previous publications. The constructed inverse class-E PA was subjected to a nonconstant envelope 16 quadrature amplitude modulation signal and was linearized using combined lookup table (LUT) and enhanced injection technique from which superior properties from each technique can be simultaneously adopted. The proposed method resulted in 0.7% measured error vector magnitude (in rms) and 34-dB adjacent channel leakage power ratio improvement, which was 10 dB better than that achieved using the LUT predistortion alone.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4745830/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10478461","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Digital Baseband Predistortion Based Linearized Broadband Inverse Class-E Power Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Baseband Predistortion Based Linearized Broadband Inverse Class-E Power Amplifier","sourcePdf":"tmtt-thian-2011164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053936S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4777655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4777655","articleId":"4745830","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4745832,"authors":[{"name":"Fei You","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4777655/4745832/4745832-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fei You (S'07) received the Bachelor's degree in electronic engineering, the Master's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in circuits and systems at UESTC.","His research interests include high-efficiency power-amplifier design and its application in linearization transmitters.

These controllers are still under operation and are derived from the modulus of the active power flow in the NS line that is phase-lagged at the frequency of the NS mode and may experience relatively large excursions generated by exogenous disturbances. This paper utilizes the same 1999 data to compare the performance of a proposed robust POD controller design with those of two conventional designs. A recent robust control synthesis algorithm used in this work is based on a nonsmooth optimization technique and has the capability to handle various controller structures, including reduced-order, and to deal with time-domain constraints on both controlled and measured outputs. Moreover, the nonsmooth design technique encompasses multiple operating conditions subject to various test signals, hence building a truly time-domain multi-scenarios approach. According to the results discussed hereafter, this is a key advantage in the industrial context of increasing demand for performance and robustness. The described results relate to a large-scale system model used in the feasibility studies for that interconnection.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2006999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2006999","startPage":"226","endPage":"236","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4762160/04745836.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Design of a TCSC Oscillation Damping Controller in a Weak 500-kV Interconnection Considering Multiple Power Flow Scenarios and External Disturbances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Design of a TCSC Oscillation Damping Controller in a Weak 500-kV Interconnection Considering Multiple Power Flow Scenarios and External Disturbances","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4745836/","accessionNumber":"10428876","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4745836/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Design of a TCSC Oscillation Damping Controller in a Weak 500-kV Interconnection Considering Multiple Power Flow Scenarios and External Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-asimoes-2006999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09862S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4762160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4762160","articleId":"4745836","onlineDate":"09 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4745893,"authors":[{"name":"Noritaka Sato","affiliation":["University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Noritaka","lastName":"Sato","id":"37277748700"},{"name":"Kazuyuki Kon","affiliation":["University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuyuki","lastName":"Kon","id":"37294877600"},{"name":"Hiroaki Fukushima","affiliation":["University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Fukushima","id":"37285570600"},{"name":"Fumitoshi Matsuno","affiliation":["University of Electro-Communications, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumitoshi","lastName":"Matsuno","id":"37277023100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2031-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2032-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-3247"}],"articleNumber":"4745893","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4745893","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Navigation","Robot sensing systems","Robot vision systems","Cameras","Robot control","Displays","Intelligent robots","Monitoring","Control systems","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction","light pens","multi-robot systems","position control","service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["map-based navigation interface","multiple rescue robots","information collection","disaster","environment map","target position","touch-pen device","formation control algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["human robot interface","formation control","multiple robots","rescue robot"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a navigation interface for multiple robots.

Several flexible LDPC decoders have been presented in the literature but their throughput (less than 640 Mbps) is limited due to block-serial scheduling of the decoding computations. The proposed architecture is based on a block-parallel scheduling scheme using a layered decoding method. To achieve higher throughput, check node-based processes are implemented in a fully parallel architecture and the memory is partitioned into a number of banks.

In this paper, we present a novel fast architecture for the point addition/doubling level in the projective coordinate.

Since the CABAC decoder has strong data dependency while decoding a plurality of bins, we propose a novel pipeline architecture to speed up this operation. Based on different types of syntax elements, two approaches to improve throughput are proposed. In addition, we re-arrange the context models in memory by applying two principles in order to reduce the usage of memory space and to lower the frequency in memory access.

We propose an algorithm for jointly optimizing the transmit and receive beamformers and resources allocation to minimize the transmission power and at the same time satisfying userspsila quality of service (QoS) in terms of bit error rate (BER) and minimum data rate. In the proposed algorithm, userspsila transmit/receive beamformers are first designed to maximize the sum-rate of each tone. Based on this tone capacity information, an iterative algorithm is developed to allocate the tones to the users. After the tone allocation, the bit rate allocation of each user at the tones allocated is then determined to minimize the total transmission power under the constraint of minimum data rate. This last problem is formulated as a geometric programming (GP) problem. Compared to the traditional algorithms, the proposed approach can make efficient use of the spatial diversity and the frequency diversity of MIMO-OFDM systems, resulting in improved performance. Numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746092.pdf","startPage":"590","endPage":"593","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit/Receive beamformer design and resource allocation in multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Quality of service","Bit rate","Bit error rate","Iterative algorithms","Downlink","Frequency diversity","Algorithm design and analysis","Interference","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","geometric programming","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","downlink multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","transmit beamformers","receive beamformers","quality of service","QoS","BER","bit error rate","minimum data rate","tone capacity information","iterative algorithm","geometric programming problem","spatial diversity","frequency diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"Transmit/Receive beamformer design and resource allocation in multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746092/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455610","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit/Receive beamformer design and resource allocation in multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059539S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4746094,"authors":[{"name":"Wan-Shing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Commu., De-Lin Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wan-Shing Yang","id":"37276964000"},{"name":"Kuan-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuan-Yu Chen","id":"37654882400"},{"name":"Wen-Hsien Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Hsien Fang","id":"37274389700"},{"name":"Hoang-Yang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Huafan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hoang-Yang Lu","id":"37274986700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2341-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2342-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746094","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"abstract":"This paper proposes a simple, yet effective generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC)-based Capon multiuser receiver for the Alamouti space-time block coded (STBC) multiple-input multiple-output code-division multiple-access (MIMO CDMA) systems.

With an ingenious DF scheme, refer to as the the cross DF (CDF), the desired signals will be blocked more thoroughly after the blocking matrix so that the interference suppression capability can be further enhanced. Performance analysis is also provided to show that that the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) of the receiver using the CDF is indeed lower than those with or without the classical DF scheme.

This work shows that the hysteresis solution offers both lower power consumption and higher audio performances for embedded audio application.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746112","startPage":"668","endPage":"671","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746112.pdf","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A topological comparison of PWM and hysteresis controls in switching audio amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"A topological comparison of PWM and hysteresis controls in switching audio amplifiers","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746112/","accessionNumber":"10455630","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746112/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A topological comparison of PWM and hysteresis controls in switching audio amplifiers","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042156S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746112","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4746113,"authors":[{"name":"Hwang-Cherng Chow","affiliation":["Department and Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hwang-Cherng","lastName":"Chow","id":"37267063100"},{"name":"Zhi-Hau Hor","affiliation":["Department and Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Zhi-Hau Hor","id":"37087720443"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2341-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2342-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746113","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1457},"abstract":"A new method to detect the power supply and ground noise (PSN) in ICs is proposed in this paper.

Furthermore, periodic precharge in read/write (R/W) cycle is the major source of power consumption in an SRAM circuit. To address these two concerns, a newly developed SRAM architecture, with specific concentration on read operation, is described in this paper. By utilizing a ldquopreequalizerdquo scheme, direct connections of the bit lines to power-supply nodes at the beginning of read cycle no longer exist, thereby having the SRAM be provided with an improved power efficiency. The preequalize scheme also yields an increased read static noise margin (SNM) and a cell area comparable to that of the conventional counterpart, due to the similarity between the proposed SRAM cell and familiar inverter circuit in geometry (aspect) ratios of the transistors involved. Several concerns stemming from the proposed scheme are discussed. A 4-kb-capacity prototype designed in a 0.18-mum CMOS process achieves a more power-efficient operation as compared to that adopting conventional architecture.","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746127.pdf","startPage":"729","endPage":"732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power area-efficient SRAM with enhanced read stability in 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746127","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"A low-power area-efficient SRAM with enhanced read stability in 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455645","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4746127/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power area-efficient SRAM with enhanced read stability in 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065025S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4746144,"authors":[{"name":"X.L.

Since time-multiplexed pilot channels are employed for channel estimation, the total transmission power should be properly assigned to the pilot and data channels to achieve the best performance. By minimizing the mean square error (MSE) during signal detection, a closed form expression is derived for the optimal power ratio between the pilot and data channels. It is shown that the optimal power ratio is mainly decided by the number of transmit antennas and the number of pilot and data symbols in a packet, while it is not sensitive to other system parameters like signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the frequency domain spreading factor. Simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the derived optimal power ratio.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746149","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746149.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","startPage":"822","endPage":"825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation for channel estimation in MIMO-OFCDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation for channel estimation in MIMO-OFCDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746149/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455667","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4746149/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation for channel estimation in MIMO-OFCDM systems","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067691S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4746151,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Moreover, the variation of neutral point voltage due to unbalanced capacitor voltages can be adjusted by controlling the proposed middle-vectors. The effectiveness of compensation for departure of NP potential during the system dynamic processes is guaranteed by distributing the active time of middle voltage vectors to the corresponding small voltage vectors. Detailed mathematical analysis is presented to illustrate the proposed middle vector synthesizing method. To verify the theoretical analysis, digital simulation using Matlab/Simulink is conducted and experiment setup is also built, both simulation and experimental results confirmed the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1028","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746198.pdf","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746198","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Voltage control","Capacitors","Modulation","Filters","Support vector machines","Torque control","Clamps","Semiconductor diodes","Power semiconductor switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space vector modulation","three-level neutral point clamped inverter","synthesized middle space vectors","neutral point voltage variations","vector synthesis","digital simulation","Matlab-Simulink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Three-level Inverter","Space Vector Modulation","Restraint of Neutral Point voltage","Vector Synthesizing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel space vector modulation method of three-level inverter based on the synthesized middle space vectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455716","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4746198/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746198/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel space vector modulation method of three-level inverter based on the synthesized middle space vectors","confLoc":"Macao","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094069S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4746206,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Shu","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Ran Shu","id":"37087305412"},{"name":"Jianhui Wu","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jianhui Wu","id":"37087218863"},{"name":"Shengli Lu","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Shengli Lu","id":"37087196186"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2341-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2342-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746206","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746206","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Feedback","Digital video broadcasting","Satellite broadcasting","Tuners","Wideband","Impedance matching","Broadband amplifiers","Multimedia communication","Broadcast technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Ge-Si alloys","integrated circuit design","low noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband low noise amplifier design","shunt shunt resistance feedback technology","DVB-S","digital video broadcasting via satellite tuner","resistor feedback","wideband input matching","BiCMOS technology","dc biasing current","frequency 0.9 GHz to 2.2 GHz","size 0.35 mum","gain 17.6 dB","noise figure 3.6 dB to 4 dB","voltage 5 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DVB-S","SiGe BiCMOS","zero-IF receiver","resistance feedback","low-noise","wide-band input matching"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, A wide-band 0.9\u20132.2GHz low-noise amplifier(LNA) employing the shunt-shunt resistance feedback technology is presented for DVB-S(digital video broadcasting via satellite) tuner application.

Analysis shows that our introduced architecture can achieve 2 times speedup over the conventional design with about the same hardware complexity.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746219","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746219.pdf","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient architecture for the Tate pairing in characteristic three","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient architecture for the Tate pairing in characteristic three","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746219/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455737","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746219/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient architecture for the Tate pairing in characteristic three","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055874S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4746220,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Yuehua","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Ding Yuehua","id":"37649115400"},{"name":"Yin Junxun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yin Junxun","id":"37658801800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2341-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2342-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746220","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Maximum likelihood detection","Computational modeling","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO systems","detection algorithm","rectangular searching","computational complexity","maximum likelihood algorithm","BER","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a detection algorithm for MIMO system with nonbinary modulation scheme.

It has considerably reduced computational complexity compared to ML (maximum likelihood) algorithm because only a small part of candidate constellation points are located in the searching rectangle.

Cooley-Tookey based decomposition method is the most popular technique for an N point DFT where N is an integral power of 2. There are 2 decomposition techniques, decimation in frequency (DIF) and decimation in time (DIT), which are widely popular. Both the techniques require a core design and either an output reorder section or an input reorder section depending on whether we are using DIF or DIT respectively. An extensive literature is available for the core design part. However we donpsilat find much literature which discussed the design issues of the reorder section. Moreover if the design is targeted for high throughput application and incoming data is continuous in nature it becomes a challenging problem to design the reorder section with minimum complexity. In this paper we formulate the minimum latency required to reorder output (or input) of a DIF (or DIT) FFT architecture of N point, where N is an integer power of 2. We also find out the minimum buffer length required to implement the reorder section. Finally we propose a simple low power reorder architecture using a single random access memory (RAM) suitable for continuous data, pipelined FFT architecture. The proposed architecture is more valuable for high value of N.","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746224.pdf","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1135","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On output reorder buffer design of bit reversed pipelined continuous data FFT architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Discrete Fourier transforms","Throughput","Computer architecture","Read-write memory","OFDM","Fast Fourier transforms","Feedback","Algorithm design and analysis","Telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","discrete Fourier transforms","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output reorder buffer design","bit reversed pipelined architecture","continuous data FFT architecture","fast Fourier transform","reduced complexity algorithm","computational complexity","discrete Fourier transform","Cooley-Tookey based decomposition method","decimation in frequency","decimation in time","random access memory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"On output reorder buffer design of bit reversed pipelined continuous data FFT architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746224/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455742","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On output reorder buffer design of bit reversed pipelined continuous data FFT architecture","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052554S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4746235,"authors":[{"name":"Fuding Ge","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Fuding Ge","id":"37087167673"},{"name":"Brent Thomas","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37529336400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2341-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2342-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746235","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2059},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","Differential amplifiers","Bandwidth","Circuits","Robustness","MOS devices","Gain","Power supplies","Feedback","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","compensation","feedback amplifiers","instrumentation amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-voltage high-gain wide-bandwidth class-AB differential difference amplifier","DDA","CMOS process","cascode Miller compensation","folded-cascode OTA","wide swing biasing circuit","translinear circuit","NMOS pair","PMOS pair","DC open loop gain","unity-gain bandwidth","current feedback instrumentation amplifier","gain 80 dB","bandwidth 20 MHz","current 380 muA","voltage 1.5 V","size 0.13 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746235","abstract":"This paper presents a CMOS low-voltage high gain and wide bandwidth differential difference amplifier (DDA).

While for some special applications, such as distributed shared memory (DSM) and multi-mode cryptosystems, itpsilas not necessary to introduce the dynamic routing mechanism between multiple processing elements (PEs) due to their different communication features. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical topology which is scalable, resource-efficient, latency-predictable, compact and easy to implement due to its simple interconnect. In a hierarchical topology, the router can be designed statically so that the transport latency of packets transmitted via the on-chip network becomes much easier to predict as long as the deadlock and starvation problems have been prevented. In this paper, we analyze the local transport latency and the global transport latency of our application specific NoC design and show that they are predictable and bounded within a boundary derived from the proposed prediction equations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design and transport latency analysis of a locality-aware network on chip architecture","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746259","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746259.pdf","startPage":"1272","endPage":"1275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"The design and transport latency analysis of a locality-aware network on chip architecture","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746259/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455777","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design and transport latency analysis of a locality-aware network on chip architecture","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050138S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4746268,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It exploits the similarity of 4-point DCT and 8-point DCT using permutation matrices. Since our circuit accepts the transform coefficients from the users, it can be extended very easily to cover any kind of DCT-based transforms for future standards. The multipliers in the transform circuit are shared by the quantization circuit in order to minimize the circuit size. The quantization operations are performed using spare clock cycles during the transform operations in order to minimize the number of clock cycles required.

In this paper, synthesizable, high throughput, scalable and parallel HDL models supporting the 21 different BCH+LDPC DVB-S2 code configurations are presented. For BCH decoding, an efficient Chien search circuit for shortened BCH codes is proposed. The LDPC codec architecture explores the periodicity M = 360 of the special LDPC-IRA codes adopted by the standard.

A hyperbolic tangent model has been used to describe the nonlinearity of the Opamppsilas gain, which provides the error less than 0.26% against the transistor-level implementation. During the simulation of sigma-delta modulator, the switch-capacitor circuits and comparator are implemented in transistor level, simulations are performed at the transistor and behavioral mixed level, thus the error caused by time sequence has been introduced into the simulation results. The comparative results show that the Verilog-A model for Opamp incurs an error of no more than 0.3 dB in the magnitude of harmonics while providing a 15times advantage in the simulation speed with respect to transistor-level implementations.","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746344","startPage":"1612","endPage":"1615","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746344.pdf","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavioral modeling for operational amplifier in sigma-delta modulators with Verilog-A","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"Behavioral modeling for operational amplifier in sigma-delta modulators with Verilog-A","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746344/","accessionNumber":"10455862","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746344/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavioral modeling for operational amplifier in sigma-delta modulators with Verilog-A","confLoc":"Macao, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033407S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4746350,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Zhang","affiliation":["LAPEM, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Chuan Zhang","id":"37575119800"},{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"lastName":"Li Li","id":"37280704400"},{"name":"Jun Lin","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"lastName":"Jun Lin","id":"37404496000"},{"name":"Zhongfeng Wang","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhongfeng Wang","id":"37279255300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2341-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2342-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746350","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","CMOS technology","Hardware","Throughput","Quantization","Routing","Bit error rate","Very large scale integration","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","computational complexity","decoding","integrated circuit design","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity shift-LDPC decoder","high-speed communication systems","high-speed low-density parity-check decoding","nonuniform quantization schemes","computation complexity","8192-bit LDPC decoder","hardware reduction","state-of-the-art design","SMIC CMOS technology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746350","displayPublicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723905/4745943/04746350.pdf","startPage":"1636","endPage":"1639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746350","doi":"10.1109/APCCAS.2008.4746350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4745943","publicationTitle":"APCCAS 2008 - 2008 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity shift-LDPC decoder for high-speed communication systems","abstract":"In this paper, an efficient high-speed low-density parity-check (LDPC) decoder is presented.

Our encoding algorithm employs parity bit prediction and correction to break up the data dependency within the encoding process. The encoder can achieve higher level of parallelism and better hardware utilization. The number of required clock cycles for encoding one codeword can be reduced to achieve higher throughput performance.

The frequency synthesizer operates in the band group 1 whose center frequencies are 3432 MHz, 3960 MHz, and 4488 MHz. To cover the overall frequencies of group 1, an efficient frequency planning minimizing a number of blocks and the power consumption are proposed. And, a high-frequency VCO and LO mixer architecture are also presented in this paper. A new mixed coarse tuning scheme that utilizes the MIM capacitance, the varactor arrays, and the DAC is proposed to expand the VCO tuning range. The frequency synthesizer can also provide the clock for the ADC in baseband modem. So, the PLL for the ADC in the baseband modem can be removed with this frequency synthesizer. The single PLL and two SSB-mixers consume 60 mW from a 1.2 V supply. The VCO tuning range is 1.2 GHz. The simulated phase noise of the VCO is -110 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset.

A novel controlled slew-rate enhancement (CSRE) circuit for error amplifier in high frequency DC-DC converters is proposed to improve transient responds of DC-DC converters under large load current changes.

By detecting the maximum difference current corresponding to the maximum derivation of the output voltage and optimizing sizes of the CSRE circuit, the CSRE circuit can be controlled properly so that the system stability can be guaranteed in various operating conditions. When the proposed circuits was employed in 100 MHz buck DC-DC converters implemented in SMIC 0.18 mum CMOS process, the simulation results of transient responses show that the CSRE circuit improves the average 1% settling time by 20 times and overshoot by 16 times, while the total quiescent power is only increased by less than 7.1.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-3 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4746404/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10455922","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Controlled Slew Rate Enhancement Circuit for Error Amplifier in High Frequency DC-DC Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlled Slew Rate Enhancement Circuit for Error Amplifier in High Frequency DC-DC Converters","confLoc":"Macao","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042748S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723905","isNumber":"4745943","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723905","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4745943","articleId":"4746404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4746437,"authors":[{"name":"Weihua Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences, ChongQing, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37578736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3480-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746437","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Radial basis function networks","Neural networks","Image recognition","Computer networks","Pattern recognition","Focusing","Image databases","Spatial databases","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","radial basis function networks","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","radial basis function neural network","computer pattern recognition","RBF neural network","face image vector","image-size normalization","hidden layer neural node"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face Recognition","Radial Basis Function","Gray-scale Conversion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746437","abstract":"The face recognition is an active subject in the area of computer pattern recognition, which has been a focus in reach for the last couple of decades because of its widely potential applications.

Among the primary advantages of OWC system are the high data rate, unlicensed spectrum of operation, quick and inexpensive setup. Meanwhile, unique OWC features such as the node, link and bandwidth availability due to interferences from weather or others remain as the challenge for designing a robust and high-performance OWC network. In this paper, we propose new Integer Linear Programming formulations to model and optimize OWC topology design while taking into the node, link and bandwidth availability, and partial request accommodation into consideration. Our analysis and results provide valuable insights into designing robust and reconfigurable OWC networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4746584/4746585/04746591.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integer Linear Programming Approach for Topology Design in OWC Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integer linear programming","Network topology","Bandwidth","Optical fiber networks","Streaming media","Robustness","Wireless communication","Multimedia systems","Interference","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","optical communication","optical links","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer linear programming","topology design","optical wireless communication networks","free space optical link","home environments","partial request accommodation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Integer Linear Programming Approach for Topology Design in OWC Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746591/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456835","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integer Linear Programming Approach for Topology Design in OWC Networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047693S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4746584","isNumber":"4746585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4746584","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4746585","articleId":"4746591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4746593,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Spatial diversity is an attractive solution to improve system capacity as well as system performance by providing array gain or increased SNR. Satellites (GEO,MEO) and High Altitude platform stations(HAPS) also exploit spatial diversity in LOS/NLOS envirornment. Exact nature of the diversity system depends on satellite antenna configuration. One of such configuration is SIMO diversity system that realizes receive diversity. LDPC codes have outstanding performance in some cases than that of turbo codes, with iterative decoding algorithm which is easy to implement and parallelizable in hardware. LDPC codes when implemented along with SIMO system with Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) under the combination of AWGN and multipath fading is optimum from the standpoint of maximising SNR at combiner output. In addition when operating in interference scenario optimum combining can be employed that maximizes the output SINR. In this paper it is shown that LDPC codes with optimum combining (LDPC-OC) system improves SINR by 1.98 dB and 2.62 dB with 3 and 4 receive antennas respectively in multipath fading channel in the presence of a single interferer.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.11","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4746584/4746585/04746596.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Diversity with LDPC Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Diversity with LDPC Codes","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746596/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456840","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Diversity with LDPC Codes","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068461S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4746584","isNumber":"4746585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4746584","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4746585","articleId":"4746596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4746630,"authors":[{"name":"Sarah Omar al-Humoud","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Sarah Omar","lastName":"al-Humoud","id":"38271441100"},{"name":"Lewis M.

Cognitive radio networks rely on detecting whether a particular segment of the radio spectrum is currently in use and to exploit the temporarily unused spectrum rapidly without interfering with the transmissions of other users. Thus, one of the most important and critical components of the cognitive radio is spectrum sensing and accordingly, detection of primary users. Recently proposed cooperative spectrum sensing methods do not consider errors occurring during the transmission of local cognitive radio decisions to the cognitive base station. However, perfect communication is clearly not the case in realistic cooperative spectrum sensing scenarios and might lead to misleading performance result interpretations. In this paper, we extend the cooperative spectrum sensing model to admit transmission imperfections and propose two simple, hardware-friendly and effective primary user detectors operating on noisy local cognitive radio decisions. We present simulation results investigating the performance loss incurred by considering realistic channels with varying signal-to-noise ratio values. Moreover, we compare the two proposed cooperative spectrum sensing algorithms in various practical scenarios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746585","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4746584/4746585/04746665.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing over Imperfect Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4746665/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing over Imperfect Channels","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456907","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing over Imperfect Channels","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04345S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4746584","isNumber":"4746585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4746584","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4746585","articleId":"4746665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4746666,"authors":[{"name":"Honghai Zhang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Honghai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280794700"},{"name":"Luca Venturino","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Venturino","id":"37284300600"},{"name":"Narayan Prasad","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Narayan","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37284625900"},{"name":"Sampath Rangarajan","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sampath","lastName":"Rangarajan","id":"37282909600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3061-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3062-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"4746666","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Base stations","Throughput","Power control","Scheduling algorithm","Convergence","Distributed algorithms","Electronic mail","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","OFDM modulation","power control","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA wireless data networks","distributed inter-cell interference mitigation","multi-carrier wireless cellular networks","binary power control","network weighted sum-rate","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of distributed inter-cell interference mitigation in multi-carrier wireless cellular networks. Assuming that neighboring base stations can be coordinated, we optimize the network weighted sum-rate via binary power control. The weights account for different priorities of mobile terminals, and are periodically updated to maintain proportional fairness. We design two distributed algorithms for inter-cell coordination which converge to a state where no base station can individually change its activity status to improve the weighted sum-rate of the network. Numerical results show that these algorithms achieve a significant throughput gain, especially for cell-edge users (up to 20%), compared to a conventional proportional fair scheduling algorithm without inter-cell coordination. Remarkably, the proposed distributed algorithms require limited feedback and achieve most of the throughput gain within few iterations.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.81","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4746584/4746585/04746666.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Inter-Cell Interference Mitigation in OFDMA Wireless Data Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Inter-Cell Interference Mitigation in OFDMA Wireless Data Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746666/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10456908","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746666/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Inter-Cell Interference Mitigation in OFDMA Wireless Data Networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053014S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4746584","isNumber":"4746585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4746584","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4746585","articleId":"4746666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4746668,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Wrulich","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and RF Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Wrulich","id":"37395809100"},{"name":"Sven Eder","affiliation":["Siemens AG, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Eder","id":"37662873000"},{"name":"Ingo Viering","affiliation":["Nomor Research, Germany"],"firstName":"Ingo","lastName":"Viering","id":"37269271700"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and RF Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3061-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3062-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"4746668","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"abstract":"To assess the performance of future mobile network technologies, system level simulations are crucial. They serve to identify whether, and to which amount, predicted link level performance gains are obtained in an entire network. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient link-to-system level model for system-level evaluations of multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), including double-stream transmit antenna array (D-TxAA) as a special case. The model is based on a fairly general structure which also allows for the mapping of more than two independent streams. We base the description on the post-equalization signal- to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) and represent it in a so- called \"fading-parameter\" structure, which leads to a nice split of the individual interference terms - which can be used e.g. for receiver optimization. These fading-parameters furthermore allow for a generation prior to the system level simulation itself, which reduces the computational burden significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4746584/4746585/04746668.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Link-to-System Level Model for MIMO HSDPA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Computational modeling","Signal to noise ratio","Power system modeling","Interference","Analytical models","Downlink","Transmitting antennas","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","radio links","subscriber loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["link-to-system level model","MIMO HSDPA","high-speed downlink packet access","multiple-input multiple-output system","double-stream transmit antenna array","post-equalization signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Link-to-System Level Model for MIMO HSDPA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746668/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456910","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Link-to-System Level Model for MIMO HSDPA","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079797S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4746584","isNumber":"4746585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4746584","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4746585","articleId":"4746668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4746670,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoting Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoting","lastName":"Wang","id":"37657513200"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"},{"name":"Zongyin Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications Technology, China"],"firstName":"Zongyin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37656024500"},{"name":"Tianlin Zhu","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications Technology, China"],"firstName":"Tianlin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37653623700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3061-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3062-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"4746670","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":294},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Throughput","Transmitting antennas","Signal processing algorithms","Silicon carbide","Wireless communication","Scheduling algorithm","Interference cancellation","Algorithm design and analysis","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fairness adjustable grouping multiuser scheduling","MIMO MAC","MMSE-SIC receiver","minimum mean square error-successive interference cancel receiver","multiple access channel","3GPP LTE VMIMO","virtual multiple input multiple output systems","pairing scheduling","proportional fair scheduling","multiuser diversity gain"]}],"abstract":"A fairness adjustable grouping (FAG) multiuser scheduling algorithm based on MMSE-SIC (minimum mean square error-successive interference cancel) receiver is proposed for MIMO MAC (multiple access channel).

This algorithm makes use of the proportional fair (PF) scheduling to select the primary user, and applies of grouping method as well as a designed fairness adjustable pairing criterion to select the paring user which takes account of both the channel orthogonality and system capacity. The comparison simulation results show that the FAGPS scheme exploits the multiplexing gain and the multiuser diversity gain, while at the same time improves the service quality of the users at the cell edge.

For a system working under frequency-division duplexing (FDD) mode, simple practically realizable transmission strategy is proposed which provides necessary channel state information to both sides with minimal resource utilization for downlink (DL) data transmission. For the given transmission strategy, high SNR degrees of freedom (DOF) for the DL channel are specified. If the users have data to transmit in the uplink (UL) direction, with no extra burden of training, full multiplexing gain of the multiple-access channel (MAC) can be achieved. Thus the given strategy makes the system fully scalable for the data transmission in both directions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4746584/4746585/04746675.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Globecom Workshops","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.90","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser MIMO Downlink: Multiplexing Gain Without Free Channel Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Transmitting antennas","Channel state information","Transmitters","Frequency","Mobile communication","Data communication","Broadcasting","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO downlink","multiplexing gain","channel state information","frequency-division duplexing mode","downlink data transmission","multiple-access channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser MIMO Downlink: Multiplexing Gain Without Free Channel Information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746675/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456917","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"30 Nov.-4 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser MIMO Downlink: Multiplexing Gain Without Free Channel Information","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063485S","chronDate":"Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4746584","isNumber":"4746585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4746584","xplore-issue":"4746585","articleId":"4746675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4746680,"authors":[{"name":"Danhua Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Danhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37404881600"},{"name":"Youzheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youzheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281422400"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278637500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3061-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3062-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-0077"}],"articleNumber":"4746680","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Relays","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Performance analysis","Quality of service","Polynomials","System performance","Base stations","Employment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","optimisation","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDM","cooperative relay networks","cooperative cellular networks","multiple sources","multiple relays","single destination","amplify-and-forward","decode-and-forward","general optimization problems","single-carrier allocation","multicarrier allocation","binary integer problem","evolutional based algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we focus on resource allocation in OFDMA based cooperative cellular networks with multiple sources, multiple relays and a single destination.

Only a handful of these formulas are reliable to determine the reading-level of a sample text. Ascertaining the readability of curricula is an important step toward optimizing the effectiveness of the educational progress. Readability measurements are done using manual computation. This is a tedious and time-consuming task. However, nowadays, automatic readability computation has gained much popularity than ever before. This can be attributed to the advancement in the field of natural language processing. Languages such as English and Spanish have benefited from the formation of automatic readability systems. Absence of automated readability measurement of Arabic texts and the large amount of information which are written in Arabic encouraged us to work on finding an automatic readability system for our language; the mother language for millions of Arabs. In this paper we will review the different readability research and then propose a system for automating the readability measurement of Arabic text. Within the paper we also report the results of our pilot experiment carried out on the different well-known Arabic, Swedish and English readability formulas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746711/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10454113","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746711/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Towards the development of an automatic readability measurements for arabic language","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards the development of an automatic readability measurements for arabic language","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050608S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733742","isNumber":"4746691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733742","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4746691","articleId":"4746711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":4746740,"authors":[{"name":"Yuzana","affiliation":["University of Computer Studies, Yangon, Myanmar"],"lastName":"Yuzana","id":"37658875600"},{"name":"Khin Marlar Tun","affiliation":["University of Computer Studies, Yangon, Myanmar"],"firstName":"Khin Marlar","lastName":"Tun","id":"37661015200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2916-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2917-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746740","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"abstract":"Myanmar language has no white spaces and word boundary. There is lack of support in Unicode database application such as collation and searching. Powerful collation strategy has necessitated to the all embracing research in the locality of natural language processing. Consequently, we propose a new collation algorithm MyCollate2 extend from MyCollate1 for Myanmar language. This collation algorithm is based on heuristics chart or table. This method foremost slices the syllables of names and then collates them according to the traditional standard Myanmar language dictionary book order. Propose new heuristics chart can work well not only for syllable segmentation but also for collation of words. This algorithm can collate Myanmar names as well as Myanmar words with complex syllable structure such as Pali, Pali loan styles, subscript styles and kinzi styles. This paper tested with Myanmar name, Pali words from Damma books and dictionary words from dictionary book. The experimental result shows that syllable slicing accuracy get 99.55% compare with others and show slicing performance. Collation accuracy gets 95.88% and is better accuracy than previous collation algorithm MyCollate1.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Digital Information Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733742/4746691/04746740.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"543","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Digital Information Management","doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of collation algorithm for Myanmar language","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Books","Dictionaries","Natural language processing","Sorting","Natural languages","Clustering algorithms","Databases","Libraries","Information retrieval","White spaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dictionaries","natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collation algorithm","unicode database application","collation strategy","natural language processing","MyCollate2","MyCollate1","heuristics chart","heuristics table","Myanmar language dictionary","syllable segmentation","Pali loan styles","subscript styles","kinzi styles","Myanmar name","Pali words","Damma books","dictionary words","syllable slicing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of collation algorithm for Myanmar language","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746740/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454141","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of collation algorithm for Myanmar language","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052442S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733742","isNumber":"4746691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733742","xplore-issue":"4746691","articleId":"4746740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4746766,"authors":[{"name":"Millie Pant","affiliation":["Department. of Paper Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Millie","lastName":"Pant","id":"37603464400"},{"name":"Radha Thangaraj","affiliation":["Babes Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Radha","lastName":"Thangaraj","id":"37602969200"},{"name":"Crina Grosan","affiliation":["Center of Excellence for Quantifiable Quality of Service, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"firstName":"Crina","lastName":"Grosan","id":"37282607100"},{"name":"Ajith Abraham","affiliation":["Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet, Trondheim, NO"],"firstName":"Ajith","lastName":"Abraham","id":"37297713700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2916-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2917-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746766","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":499},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Iterative algorithms","Life testing","Genetic mutations","Random number generation","Paper technology","Quality of service","Algorithm design and analysis","Stochastic processes","Hybrid power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global optimization problems","particle swarm optimization algorithm","hybrid differential evolution"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746691","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Digital Information Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Digital Information Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733742/4746691/04746766.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Differential Evolution - Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Solving Global Optimization Problems","abstract":"This paper presents a simple, hybrid two phase global optimization algorithm called DE-PSO for solving global optimization problems.

In order to process such automatically, complex business entities need to be identified. Examples for complex entities are products, business partners and purchase orders which are stored in a supplier relationship management system. Both, structured records in the enterprise system and text data, describe these complex entities. A major challenge is to correctly associate entities recognized in unstructured data with entities stored in structured data, e.g. enterprise databases. We address that problem and propose a robust process methodology which includes three phases: candidate extraction from unstructured text, generation of initial mappings with structured data and disambiguation of the mappings exploiting relationships among the entities in the enterprise data and the documentspsila structure. We describe each step in detail, propose a common architecture and introduce to our data model and algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust recognition of complex entities in text exploiting enterprise data and NLP-techniques","doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746780","startPage":"551","endPage":"558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746691","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Digital Information Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Digital Information Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733742/4746691/04746780.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust recognition of complex entities in text exploiting enterprise data and NLP-techniques","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746780/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454181","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust recognition of complex entities in text exploiting enterprise data and NLP-techniques","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095986S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733742","isNumber":"4746691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733742","xplore-issue":"4746691","articleId":"4746780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4746810,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet Celenk","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stocker Center, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Celenk","id":"37294790800"},{"name":"Thomas Conley","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stocker Center, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Conley","id":"37402457600"},{"name":"John Willis","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stocker Center, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Willis","id":"37408521800"},{"name":"James Graham","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stocker Center, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Graham","id":"38546432200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2916-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2917-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746810","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Entropy","Statistics","Telecommunication traffic","Displays","Computer vision","Time measurement","Stochastic processes","Data security","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","security of data","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","Fisher discriminant clustering","network entropy","entropy-based methods","long-term network statistics","time-averaged entropies","information graph","short-term information measurement","second-order time averaging statistics","first-order time averaging statistics","Fisher linear discriminant","stochastic clustering","real-time network traffic data","bursty network traffic","BotNet","worm outbreaks","denial-of-service attacks"]}],"abstract":"Entropy has been widely used to quantify information for display and examination in determining network status and in detecting anomalies. Although entropy-based methods are effective, they rely on long-term network statistics. Here, we propose an approach that deduces short term observations of network features and their respective time averaged entropies. Acute changes are detected in network feature space and depicted in a visually compact information graph. First, average entropy for each feature is calculated for every second of observation. Then, the resultant short-term information measurement is subjected to first- and second-order time averaging statistics. These time-varying statistics are used as the basis of a novel approach to anomaly estimation based on the well-known Fisher linear discriminant (FLD). This process then initiates stochastic clustering to identify the exact time of the security incident or attack on the network. The proposed method is tested on real-time network traffic data collected from Ohio Universitypsilas main Internet connection. Experimentation has shown that the presented FLD based method is accurate in identifying anomalies in network feature space. Furthermore, itpsilas performance is highly robust in the presence of bursty network traffic and it is able to detect network anomalies such as BotNet, worm outbreaks, and denial of service attacks.","doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746810","publicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Digital Information Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Third International Conference on Digital Information Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733742/4746691/04746810.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection and visualization using Fisher Discriminant clustering of network entropy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746810/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection and visualization using Fisher Discriminant clustering of network entropy","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454210","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746810/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection and visualization using Fisher Discriminant clustering of network entropy","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047588S","chronDate":"13-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733742","isNumber":"4746691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733742","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4746691","articleId":"4746810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4746821,"authors":[{"name":"Sasa Mrdovic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Sasa","lastName":"Mrdovic","id":"37658283200"},{"name":"Branislava Perunicic","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Branislava","lastName":"Perunicic","id":"37550416300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2916-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2917-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746821","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Payloads","Frequency","Protection","Protocols","Telecommunication traffic","Testing","Traffic control","Training data","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["payload word frequencies","boundary symbols","word appearance","word to word transitions","attack detection","network intrusion detection system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel payload analysis method.

By wearing the authentication device, the user can login transparently to any computer simply by approaching it. The prototype of the wearable authentication device was implemented and demonstrated successfully. The user was authenticated with the fingerprint and his presence could be verified continuously by using the skin temperature and the body capacitance.

In the first case, target and clutter covariance matrices are jointly diagonalizable and in the second one, signal to noise ratio (SNR)is sufficiently high.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal signals for MIMO RADAR in the presence of clutter","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2008.4746865","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733847/4746852/04746865.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2008.4746865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal signals for MIMO RADAR in the presence of clutter","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746865/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454392","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal signals for MIMO RADAR in the presence of clutter","confLoc":"Nabeul, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105862S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733847","isNumber":"4746852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733847","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4746852","articleId":"4746865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4746867,"authors":[{"name":"Wahiba Benzaba","affiliation":["Advanced Technologies, Development Center, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Wahiba","lastName":"Benzaba","id":"37658267700"},{"name":"Abedelkrim Allam","affiliation":["Advanced Technologies, Development Center, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abedelkrim","lastName":"Allam","id":"37647224500"},{"name":"Lotfi Bendaouia","affiliation":["Advanced Technologies, Development Center, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Lotfi","lastName":"Bendaouia","id":"37658266800"},{"name":"Ratiba Boutaleb","affiliation":["Advanced Technologies, Development Center, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Ratiba","lastName":"Boutaleb","id":"37658268000"},{"name":"Faycal Ykhlef","affiliation":["Advanced Technologies, Development Center, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Faycal","lastName":"Ykhlef","id":"37649239900"},{"name":"Yacine Boucetta","affiliation":["Advanced Technologies, Development Center, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Yacine","lastName":"Boucetta","id":"37658266900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2627-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2628-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746867","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pain","Field programmable gate arrays","Consumer electronics","Circuits and systems","Technological innovation","Control systems","Shape","Hospitals","Costs","Electronic components"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biomedical electronics","brain","field programmable gate arrays","low-power electronics","neuromuscular stimulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antipain electrical stimulator","FPGA circuit","transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator","brain","physiotherapy","TENS design","FPGA digital programmable component","analogical devices","impulse parameter","pain intensity block","low-power consumption","antipain remedies","evolutionary stimulator","programmable integrated circuits"]}],"abstract":"The Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (T.E.N.S.) is a medical device which is used to decrease or to block the intensity of the pain. Its working consists in helping the patient to produce a higher rate of substance secreted by the brain to block the pain. The stimulator is very much used by the hospitals specialized services in physiotherapy. The scientific and technological objectives of this project are the innovation and the control at low cost in the design and the realization of the TENS. The innovation consists in using FPGA digital programmable components instead of the traditional electronic components. Prototypes on electronic boards with FPGA components and analogical devices will be realized in order to validate the methods of stimulations used. The choice of FPGA circuits compared to ASICS ones is explained by the reduced number of devices using these kinds of circuits in the world. The achieved model should be portable with low consumption and small dimension. The advantage of the FPGA circuits used in this project consists in changing the impulse parameters provided to the patient without changing the electronics of the device. There will be only the program stored in the memory of the system to modify. This stimulator will thus have the advantage of being evolutionary and adapted to the medical discoveries related to the anti-pain remedies by electric stimulation.","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733847/4746852/04746867.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti pain stimulator using FPGA circuit","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2008.4746867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2008.4746867","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Anti pain stimulator using FPGA circuit","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454394","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4746867/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti pain stimulator using FPGA circuit","confLoc":"Nabeul, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080149S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733847","isNumber":"4746852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733847","xplore-issue":"4746852","articleId":"4746867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4746869,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Aly Refay Eltokhy","affiliation":["Electronics Technology Department, Faculty of Industrial Education, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mostafa Aly Refay","lastName":"Eltokhy","id":"37284088500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2627-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2628-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746869","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Switching circuits","Correlators","Parallel processing","Charge pumps","Voltage","Transmitters","Modulation coding","Spread spectrum communication","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","code division multiple access","correlators","field buses","large scale integration","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication","switched capacitor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA receiver","switched-capacitor analog correlator circuit","parallel processing system LSI","balanced charge pump circuit","code division multiple access bus interface","frequency 100 MHz","voltage 3.3 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog correlator","CDMA","spread spectrum","switched-capacitor","tradeoff"]}],"abstract":"A switched-capacitor analog correlator using balanced charge pump circuit, capable of pumping same amount of charge in positive and negative direction is proposed for code division multiple access (CDMA) bus interface.

We also present simulations on some standard test images to show the efficiency of the proposed transform in image compression.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733847/4746852/04746898.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2008.4746898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2008.4746898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiplication-free transform for image compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Compaction","Circuits and systems","Computational complexity","Degradation","Image reconstruction","Computational modeling","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","image coding","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplication-free transform","image compression","signed DCT matrix","discrete cosine transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiplication-free transform","8\u00d78 DCT","signed DCT","image compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A multiplication-free transform for image compression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454425","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiplication-free transform for image compression","confLoc":"Nabeul, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053016S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733847","isNumber":"4746852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733847","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4746852","articleId":"4746898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4746903,"authors":[{"name":"Aymen Lamine","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Aymen","lastName":"Lamine","id":"37663473300"},{"name":"Nabil Chouba","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Chouba","id":"37640350500"},{"name":"Laroussi Bouzaida","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Laroussi","lastName":"Bouzaida","id":"37320766500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2627-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2628-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4746903","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746903","abstract":"Time to market constraints pushes more and more designers to make area estimations early during the design process.

In this paper, we present the architecture of an all-digital transmitter with radio frequency output targeting FPGA devices due to their reconfigurability and programmability. The all-digital transmitter directly synthesizes RF signal in the digital domain using low pass delta sigma modulation (LPDSM). This eliminates the need for most of the analog and RF components. The all digital transmitter consists of one cascaded integrator comb (CIC) filter, one LPDSM modulator and digital upconverter (DUC). The binary output waveform from the RF-DeltaSigma modulator is centered at 800 MHz with bit rate of 1.6 Gbps. The proposed architecture has been simulated and proved to have a satisfactory performance. Finally, a VHDL code is written for the LPDSM to demonstrate its implementation and verifying the simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733847/4746852/04746928.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 2nd International Conference on Signals, Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSCS.2008.4746928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCS.2008.4746928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA based 1-bit all digital transmitter employing Delta-Sigma Modulation with RF output for SDR","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delta-sigma modulation","Radio frequency","Radio transmitters","Software radio","Communication industry","Computer industry","Computer architecture","Signal synthesis","Digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comb filters","delta-sigma modulation","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","radio transmitters","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined radio","FPGA devices","all digital transmitter","delta-sigma modulation","radio frequency output","digital domain","low pass delta sigma modulation","cascaded integrator comb filter","CIC filter","digital upconverter","VHDL code","word length 1 bit","bit rate 1.6 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All Digital RF Transmitter","CIC filter","CORDIC","low pass Delta Sigma Modulator","SDR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA based 1-bit all digital transmitter employing Delta-Sigma Modulation with RF output for SDR","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746928/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10454455","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA based 1-bit all digital transmitter employing Delta-Sigma Modulation with RF output for SDR","confLoc":"Nabeul, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090262S","chronDate":"7-9 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733847","isNumber":"4746852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733847","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4746852","articleId":"4746928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4746945,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper presents an application of MAS for distributed energy resource (DER) management in a MicroGrid. MicroGrid can be defined as low voltage distributed power networks comprising various distributed generators (DG), storage and controllable loads, which can be operated as interconnected or as islands from the main power grid. By representing each element in MicroGrid as an autonomous intelligent agent, multi agent modeling of a MicroGrid is designed and implemented. JADE framework is proposed for the modeling and reliability of the MicroGrid is confirmed with PowerWorld Simulator. Further, the FIPA contract net coordination between the agents is demonstrated through software simulation. As a result, this paper provides a MicroGrid modeling which has the necessary communication and coordination structure to create a scalable system. The optimized MicroGrid management and operations can be developed on it in future.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-agent coordination for DER in MicroGrid","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICSET.2008.4746976","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723923/4746961/04746976.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSET.2008.4746976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746961","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4746976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4746976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-agent coordination for DER in MicroGrid","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4746976/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456506","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-agent coordination for DER in MicroGrid","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065036S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723923","isNumber":"4746961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723923","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"4746961","articleId":"4746976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4746986,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Kai Lin","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Technology, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yong-Kai Lin","id":"37087430281"},{"name":"Yen-Shin Lai","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Technology, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yen-Shin Lai","id":"37087065521"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1887-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1888-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4387"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4395"}],"articleNumber":"4746986","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dead-time elimination of pwm-controlled inverter/converter without separate power sources for current polarity detection circuit","abstract":"This paper will present a dead-time elimination scheme for PWM-controlled inverter/converter.

It depends on environmental factors such as the solar irradiation and the temperature of these panels. The average solar energy harvested by the conventional solar panels during the course of the day, is not always maximized. This is due to the static placement of the panel which limits their area of exposure to the sun. In practice, there are three possible approaches for maximizing the solar power extraction in medium and large scale PV systems are sun tracking, maximum power point (MPP) tracking or combination of both. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) has been proposed utilizing sun tracking approaches to maximize the performance of PV panels. Literature suggested that the PV panels could produce maximum power if the panels have angle of inclination zero degree to the sun position. This work evaluate the best combination of GA parameters to optimize a solar tracking system for PV panels in terms of azimuth angle and tilt angle. Simulation results demonstrated the ability of the proposed GA system to search for optimal panel positions in term of consistency and convergence properties. It also has proved the ability of the GA-solar to adapt to different environmental conditions and successfully track sun positions in finding the maximum power by precisely orienting the PV panels.","doi":"10.1109/ICSET.2008.4747015","startPage":"269","endPage":"273","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723923/4746961/04747015.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSET.2008.4747015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Genetic Algorithm based solar tracking system for Photovoltaic panels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Sun","Solar energy","Power supplies","Environmental factors","Temperature dependence","Large-scale systems","Azimuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","solar cells","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","solar tracking system","photovoltaic panels","solar irradiation","maximum power point tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","solar tracking","PV panels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4747015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Genetic Algorithm based solar tracking system for Photovoltaic panels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4747015/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456545","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Genetic Algorithm based solar tracking system for Photovoltaic panels","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040922S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723923","isNumber":"4746961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723923","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4746961","articleId":"4747015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4747017,"authors":[{"name":"Duminda P.

Also by transforming small signal state space model to Laplace domain, stability conditions are derived for the microgrid with a constant power load connected parallel with other loads.

A partial solution to this crisis is the use of decentralized generations and vehicle-to-grid (or V2G) plug-in electric vehicles. This paper presents a novel dasialiving and mobilitypsila concept, through which plug-in-vehicles can be utilized for harnessing renewable energy, storage, transportation, and providing power for both residential and commercial customers. The proposed concept uses an efficient energy management unit (EEMU), a bidirectional power module with a grid-interface, a Web and wireless communication interface and a hybrid plug-in vehicle, called dasiaBlueAnglepsila. The EEMU overseas the operation of the overall system with real time monitoring of system variables. The power module of the proposed system uses a common DC link for power exchange. The amount and the direction of power flow amongst the sub-systems, which include the grid, renewable energy sources, household load and BlueAngle, is controlled by the EEMU in accordance with the systems variables. The proposed system is versatile, and expected to gain popularity amongst both commercial and residential users interested in resolving the global energy crisis.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723923/4746961/04747065.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"536","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICSET.2008.4747065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSET.2008.4747065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746961","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4747065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u201cLiving and mobility\u201d- a novel multipurpose in-house grid interface with plug in hybrid BlueAngle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plugs","Renewable energy resources","Multichip modules","Power generation economics","Environmental economics","Industrial economics","Distributed power generation","Hybrid electric vehicles","Energy storage","Transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid electric vehicles","load flow","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipurpose in-house grid interface","decentralized generations","vehicle-to-grid plug-in electric vehicles","energy management unit","bidirectional power module","Web","wireless communication","hybrid BlueAngle","real time monitoring","DC link","power flow","renewable energy sources"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4747065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"\u201cLiving and mobility\u201d- a novel multipurpose in-house grid interface with plug in hybrid BlueAngle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4747065/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10456595","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u201cLiving and mobility\u201d- a novel multipurpose in-house grid interface with plug in hybrid BlueAngle","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049219S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723923","isNumber":"4746961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723923","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4746961","articleId":"4747065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4747096,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Blanc","affiliation":["Laboratoire dElectronique Industrielle, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Blanc","id":"37560697900"},{"name":"Alfred Rufer","affiliation":["Laboratoire dElectronique Industrielle, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alfred","lastName":"Rufer","id":"37271772900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1887-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1888-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4387"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4395"}],"articleNumber":"4747096","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1582},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4747096","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Predictive models","Power system modeling","Biomembranes","Electrons","Hydrogen","Voltage","Circuits","Chemicals","Oxidation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrolytes","losses","secondary cells","vanadium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vanadium redox flow battery","stationary electricity storage systems","internal losses","auxiliaries losses","hydraulic circuit","charge-discharge cycles","V"]}],"abstract":"Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRB) are large stationary electricity storage systems; their performance is enhanced when they are operating under optimal conditions. The multiphysics model developed in this paper offers a good understanding of the VRB operating principles; this knowledge is important to identify and quantify the source of losses: the internal losses and the auxiliaries losses. The model is divided in two main parts: the electrochemical model that predicts the stack voltage, the variation in vanadium concentrations and the internal losses under any operating conditions and the mechanical model that describes the hydraulic circuit of the electrolyte and determines the pumps power. Then the stack efficiency is determined with the electrochemical model in a series of charge-discharge cycles and compared with experimental data.

The circuit structure of the proposed system separately adopts buck converter and flyback converter as the charger and discharger. With this circuit structure, buck converter can vary its duty ratio to regulate charging current of battery, while flyback converter with active clamp circuit can recover energy stored in leakage inductor of transformer to drive LED lighting. To simplify the circuit structure, switches of two converters are integrated with a synchronous switch technique. With this approach, the proposed system has several merits, which are a less component counts, lighter weight, smaller size and higher conversion efficiency. As compared with the conventional converter with hard-switching circuit, the proposed one can improve conversion efficiency of 7% and achieve efficiency about 83% under full load when the proposed system is operated in the driving LED condition. Experimental results obtained from a prototype with the output voltage of 10 V and output power of 20 W have been implemented to verify its feasibility.","doi":"10.1109/ICSET.2008.4747138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSET.2008.4747138","startPage":"916","endPage":"921","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723923/4746961/04747138.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Sustainable Energy Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4746961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buck converter associated with active clamp flyback converter for PV power system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Buck converter associated with active clamp flyback converter for PV power system","conferenceDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4747138/","accessionNumber":"10456668","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4747138/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buck converter associated with active clamp flyback converter for PV power system","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-01032009-00177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.224168S","chronDate":"24-27 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723923","isNumber":"4746961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723923","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4746961","articleId":"4747138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4747165,"authors":[{"name":"Hyosung Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Electronics Engineering, Kongju National University, Cheonan, ChungNam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyosung Kim","id":"37087161164"},{"name":"Kyoung-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["KACO Korea, Inc., Seongnam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyoung-Hwan Kim","id":"37087704945"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1887-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1888-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4387"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4395"}],"articleNumber":"4747165","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2813},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Power harmonic filters","Guidelines","Voltage","Inductors","Inductance","Power quality","Circuit topology","Power system harmonics","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","invertors","photovoltaic power systems","power filters","power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filter design","filter inductor","switching ripple current","single-phase grid-connected PV inverters","filter inductance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grid-connected PV inverters","Single-phase PWM inverters","Switching ripple current","Filter design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4747165","abstract":"This paper proposes filter design guideline for single-phase grid-connected PV inverters.

In the event of feeder and zone-2 faults, the d-coefficients of differential current have a time shift compared to that of source current. Further the external fault is located by comparing the polarities of peak d-coefficient of source, feeder and zone-2 currents.

The primary goal of this study is to present the efficiency of a simple hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm on the design of a network infrastructure including decisions concerning the locations and sizes of links. A complementary goal is to also address quality of service issues in the design process. Optimization objectives in this case are the network layout cost and the average packet delay in the network. Therefore a multi-objective instance of the hybrid PSO algorithm is applied. The particular hybrid PSO includes mutation to avoid premature convergence. For the same reason repulsion/attraction mechanisms are also applied on the single objective case. Mutation is passed on to the mufti-objective instance of the algorithm. Obtained results are compared with corresponding evolutionary approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IMCSIT.2008.4747351","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731350/4747203/04747351.pdf","startPage":"915","endPage":"920","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology","publicationTitle":"2008 International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMCSIT.2008.4747351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4747203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication network design using Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4747351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Communication network design using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10454381","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4747351/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication network design using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Wisla, Poland","sourcePdf":"SPI-01052009-00148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083341S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731350","isNumber":"4747203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731350","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4747203","articleId":"4747351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4747380,"authors":[{"name":"De-Shin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6104/4747373/4747380/4747380-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["De-Shin Liu received the B.S. degree from the Chung Yuan College, Jhongli City, Taiwan, in 1980, the M.S. degree in engineering mechanics from the University of Missouri, Rolla, in 1984, the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 1985, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering mechanics from the University of Missouri, Rolla, in 1989.","From 1989 to 1991, he was a Senior Project Engineer at General Motors Corporation, Warren, MI.

This paper employs ANSYS commercial software and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the design parameters of a multilayer needle probe card such that the scrub marks produced by the different needle layers are of approximately equal length. A dummy probe card containing both a conventional multilayer needle layout and the optimized needle layout is then fabricated and used in a series of single-contact probing tests. The results reveal that the scrub marks produced by the optimized needle layout are both shorter and of a more uniform length that those produced by the conventional needle design. For both needle layouts, a lower and more stable contact resistance is obtained as the overdrive distance is increased. Finally, a multicontact probing test is performed to evaluate the effect on the contact resistance of probe tip contamination following repeated surface contacts. The results show that the needles in the optimized layout are less heavily contaminated than those in the conventional layout, and hence the contact resistance is both lower and more stable. As a consequence, the probe card requires cleaning less frequently and hence its service life is improved.","doi":"10.1109/TEPM.2008.2010776","startPage":"49","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEPM.2008.2010776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4747373","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104/4747373/04747380.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a Genetic Algorithm to the Design Optimization of a Multilayer Probe Card for Wafer-Level Testing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4747380/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of a Genetic Algorithm to the Design Optimization of a Multilayer Probe Card for Wafer-Level Testing","volume":"32","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4747380/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10391425","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a Genetic Algorithm to the Design Optimization of a Multilayer Probe Card for Wafer-Level Testing","sourcePdf":"tepm-liu-2010776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052086S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4747373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4747373","articleId":"4747380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4747477,"authors":[{"name":"Ervin Zentner","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Ervin","lastName":"Zentner","id":"37268337100"},{"name":"Sonja Zentner Pilinsky","affiliation":["Polytechnics of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Sonja Zentner","lastName":"Pilinsky","id":"37264963000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3364-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"4747477","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","OFDM modulation","Intersymbol interference","Constellation diagram","Bit error rate","Shape control","Baseband","Transceivers","Local oscillators","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","transmission quality impairments","transceiver configuration","single-carrier modulation formats","IFFT processor","Fourier transform theory","inter-carrier interference","inter-symbol interference","inter-bin interference","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modulation","mobile networks","transmission quality"]}],"abstract":"The OFDM technique and basic transceiver configuration are presented.

Through an auto optic inspection (AOI), defect points from the panels are collected, and the defect images are generated after the photolithography process. The defect images are usually identified by experienced engineers or operators. Evidently, human identification may produce potential misjudgments and cause time loss. This study therefore proposes a neural-network approach for defect recognition in the TFT-LCD photolithography process. There were four neural-network methods adopted for this purpose, namely, backpropagation, radial basis function, learning vector quantization 1, and learning vector quantization 2. A comparison of the performance of these four types of neural-networks was illustrated. The results showed that the proposed approach can effectively recognize the defect images in the photolithography process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4747596/","volume":"32","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4747596/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10414828","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Neural-Network Approach for Defect Recognition in TFT-LCD Photolithography Process","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural-Network Approach for Defect Recognition in TFT-LCD Photolithography Process","sourcePdf":"31tepm04-chen-926117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063137S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4747373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4747373","articleId":"4747596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4747602,"authors":[{"name":"Fei-Yue Wang","affiliation":["University of Arizona Tucson, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Fei-Yue Wang is the vice president of the Institute of Automation and a director and professor at the Key Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

For detecting morphological QRS complex, conventional detection algorithm have been designed to detect P, QRS, T wave. However, the detection of the P and T wave is difficult because their amplitudes are relatively low, and occasionally they are included in noise. We applied two morphological feature extraction methods: higher-order statistics and Hermite basis functions. Moreover, we assumed that the QRS complexes of class N and S may have a morphological similarity, and those of class V and F may also have their own similarity. Therefore, we employed a hierarchical classification method using support vector machines, considering those similarities in the architecture. The results showed that our hierarchical classification method gives better performance than the conventional multiclass classification method. In addition, the Hermite basis functions gave more accurate results compared to the higher order statistics.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2008.4749019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4748952","publicationTitle":"2008 Computers in Cardiology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Computers in Cardiology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4729059/4748952/04749019.pdf","endPage":"232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical support vector machine based heartbeat classification using higher order statistics and hermite basis function","doi":"10.1109/CIC.2008.4749019","startPage":"229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749019","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical support vector machine based heartbeat classification using higher order statistics and hermite basis function","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749019/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10457154","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4749019/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical support vector machine based heartbeat classification using higher order statistics and hermite basis function","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082009-00067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063798S","chronDate":"14-17 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4729059","isNumber":"4748952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4729059","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4748952","articleId":"4749019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Computers in CardiologyIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4749025,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

In arrhythmia analysis, it is unavoidable that some attribute values of a person would be missing. Thus, this paper further introduces a modified PCA method to address this problem.

Segmentation of hearts sounds is a fundamental step in the analyzing process. However segmentation of heart sounds recorded with handheld stethoscopes in clinical environments is often complicated by recording and background noise. A duration-dependent hidden Markov model (DHMM) is proposed for robust segmentation of heart sounds. The DHMM model was developed and tested with heart sounds recorded at bedside with a commercially available handheld stethoscope. In a population of 60 patients, the DHMM identified 739 S1 and S2 sounds out of 744 which corresponded to a 99.3% sensitivity. There were seven incorrectly classified sounds which corresponded to a 99.1% positive predictive value.

In addition, a qualitative readout by visual tracking is also more difficult as well. Non-rigid registration can be used to compensate for these movements in the image series. Because of the local contrast and intensity change over time, the registration method needs to be chosen carefully. We propose to make use of the periodicity of the breathing movement when patients are allowed to breath freely during image acquisition. Specifically, we propose to first identify a subset of the images that corresponds to the same phase of the breathing cycle and register these to compensate for the residual differences. By using a combination of normalised gradient fields and the sum of squared differences we circumvent the problems arising from the change of intensity. Then, for each of the remaining images, reference images of a similar intensity distribution are created by a linear combination of images from the align subset. In the last step, registration is achieved by minimising the sum of squared differences. Our first experiments show that this approach is well suited to compensate for the breathing movements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Computers in Cardiology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4729059/4748952/04749079.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"468","publicationTitle":"2008 Computers in Cardiology","doi":"10.1109/CIC.2008.4749079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2008.4749079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4748952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-rigid motion compensation in free-breathing myocardial perfusion magnetic resonance imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion compensation","Myocardium","Magnetic resonance imaging","Heart","Magnetic analysis","Independent component analysis","Biomedical imaging","Biomedical engineering","Laboratories","Lungs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","cardiology","gadolinium","haemorheology","image registration","medical image processing","motion compensation","muscle","pneumodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonrigid motion compensation","free-breathing myocardial perfusion","magnetic resonance imaging","breathing movement","image acquisition","visual tracking","normalised gradient field","intensity distribution","gadolinium enhancement","image registration","sum-of-squared differences","SSD","Gd"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Non-rigid motion compensation in free-breathing myocardial perfusion magnetic resonance imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4749079/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10457212","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-rigid motion compensation in free-breathing myocardial perfusion magnetic resonance imaging","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-01082009-00127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039846S","chronDate":"14-17 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4729059","isNumber":"4748952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4729059","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4748952","articleId":"4749079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Computers in Cardiology","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4749226,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Notch Filters and adaptive chancellors have been suggested to suppress this interference. In this paper, an improved adaptive canceller for the reduction of the fundamental Power Line Interference component in electrocardiogram (EKG) recordings is proposed. A comparison is made between the performance of our method and a narrow and a wide Notch Filter and Notch Adaptive Filter in suppressing the fundamental power line interference component. For this purpose, a deal EGG signal is corrupted by an artificial power line interference signal. The cleaned signal after applying all methods is compared with the original EGG signal. Results indicate that power line interference of EKG are removed effectively by this new method. Interference elimination can be performed continuously and rapidly even if the situations of interference are changing with time or frequency. In the worst conditions 48.5Hz and 51.5Hz (BOW 1.5Hz), ANN obtained results show the efficiency (CCC=0.96 \u00b1 0.02 SIR=17.3 \u00b1 0.4) in comparison with the classical technique with the best performance (CCC=0.91\u00b10.03 SIR=13.2\u00b10.6).

Realization of unequal error tolerance involves two main issues, including how to quantify the importance of each circuit signal and how to incorporate the importance quantification into signal processing circuit design. We developed techniques to tackle these two issues and applied them to two types of trellis decoders including Viterbi decoder for convolutional code decoding and max-log-maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder for turbo code decoding. Simulation results demonstrated promising energy saving potentials of the proposed design solution on both trellis decoding computation and memory storage at small decoding performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2004545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2004545","startPage":"439","endPage":"443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4804122/04749249.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4804122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Voltage Overscaled Low-Power Trellis Decoders in Presence of Process Variations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of Voltage Overscaled Low-Power Trellis Decoders in Presence of Process Variations","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10545990","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749249/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Voltage Overscaled Low-Power Trellis Decoders in Presence of Process Variations","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi11-yliu-2004545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123252S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4804122","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4804122","articleId":"4749249","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4749250,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed controller considers the deleterious effects caused by the interaction between load and line impedances, which may lead to instabilities when the controller is enabled. The rationale behind the solution consists in the introduction of a lead compensator with a gain that is adjusted by adaptation, which replaces the conventional proportional term. This modification improves the stability conditions when the load and source impedances are non-negligible. In particular, the scheme provides a solution in the critical scenario, when the load is composed by a capacitor connected in parallel to a distorted current source. Special attention is given to the current control loop because it is precisely in this loop where the instability problems are generated. Realistic numerical results are provided to illustrate the benefits of the proposed solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749250/","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4749250/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10477150","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Controller for the Shunt Active Filter Considering a Dynamic Load and the Line Impedance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Controller for the Shunt Active Filter Considering a Dynamic Load and the Line Impedance","sourcePdf":"tcst-avaldez-2000987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059622S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4787250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4787250","articleId":"4749250","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4749253,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The approach starts by selecting strategic monitoring buses where phasor measurement units (PMUs) are placed to capture wide-area response signals in real-time operation. These measurements are processed in the time and frequency domains for extracting selected decision features such as the peak spectral density of the angle, frequency and their dot product evaluated over the grid areas. These so-called wide-area severity indices (WASI) are reliable time-varying stability indicators that form the basis of an effective classification system. Large-size DTs are used to generate initial accurate classification boundaries for decision making as early as 1 s or 2 s after fault clearing. From the DT classification boundaries, fuzzy membership functions (MFs) are developed and the corresponding fuzzy rule base is formulated parsimoniously by eliminating redundant MFs and rules using a similarity measure. The resulting fuzzy-rule classifiers are successfully tested for system-wise and area-wise contingencies based on a large database of detailed simulations of the Hydro-Quebec grid and are further confirmed on actual measurements recorded with existing wide-area measurements (WAMS).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10428878","htmlLink":"/document/4749253/","displayDocTitle":"Development of Rule-Based Classifiers for Rapid Stability Assessment of Wide-Area Post-Disturbance Records","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Rule-Based Classifiers for Rapid Stability Assessment of Wide-Area Post-Disturbance Records","sourcePdf":"24tpwrs01-ikamwa-2009430.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103614S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4762160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4762160","articleId":"4749253","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4749258,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo A.

In this paper, the related control issues are investigated, and a control methodology is established including the neural networks and a sliding control scheme. In particular, the radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are chosen for function approximations. The stability of the closed-loop system, as well as the convergence of the position and velocity tracking errors to zero, is assured by the control methodology in the presence of the aforementioned conditions. An offline learning procedure is also proposed for the improvement of the motion tracking performance. Precise tracking results of the proposed control methodology for a desired motion trajectory are demonstrated in the experimental study.

The aim of the current simulation was to investigate the dual effect of the microstructure, which consists of the effect of grain boundaries (GBs) and the effect of texture-related variations of the modulus of elasticity on the stress evolution in copper lines caused by EM. The major difference between our approach and the previously described ones is the accounting of additional stress generated by the plated atoms. The results of the numerical simulation have been proven experimentally by EM degradation studies on fully embedded dual inlaid copper interconnect test structures and by subsequent microstructure analysis, mainly based on electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data. The virtual EM-induced void formation, movement, and growth in a copper interconnect were continuously monitored in an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">situ</i>\n scanning electron microscopy experiment. The copper microstructure, particularly the orientation of grains and GBs, was determined with EBSD. For interconnects with interfaces that resist atomic transport and where GBs are the important pathways for atom migration, degradation and failure processes are completely different for microstructures with randomly oriented GBs compared with ldquobamboolikerdquo microstructures. The correspondence between simulation results and experimental data indicates the applicability of the developed model for optimization of the physical and electrical design rules.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/4796371/04749276.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"IEEE

In this investigation, wind turbine generators, photovoltaic panels, and storage batteries are used to build hybrid generation systems that are optimal in terms of multiple criteria including cost, reliability, and emissions. Multicriteria design facilitates the decision maker to make more rational evaluations. In this study, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to derive these nondominated solutions. Hybrid generation systems under different design scenarios are designed based on the proposed approach. First, a grid-linked hybrid system is designed without incoroprating system uncertainties. Then, adequacy evaluation is conducted based on probabilistic methods by accounting for equipment failures, time-dependent sources of energy, and stochastic generation/load variations. In particular, due to the unpredictability of wind speed and solar insolation as well as the random load variation, time-series models are adopted to reflect their stochastic characteristics. An adequacy evaluation procedure including time-dependent sources, is adopted. Sensitivity studies are also carried out to examine the impacts of different system parameters on the overall design performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749288/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10475502","htmlLink":"/document/4749288/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multicriteria Design of Hybrid Power Generation Systems Based on a Modified Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicriteria Design of Hybrid Power Generation Systems Based on a Modified Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tec-wang-2005280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075651S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4785258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"4785258","articleId":"4749288","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749292,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Kusiak","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/4785258/4749292/4749292-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrew Kusiak (M\u201990) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland, in 1972 and 1974, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in operations research from the Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, in 1979.","He is currently a Professor at the Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, The University of Iowa, Iowa City.

The time series models are built with data mining algorithms. Five different data mining algorithms have been tested on various wind farm datasets. Two of the five algorithms performed particularly well. The support vector machine regression algorithm provides accurate predictions of wind power and wind speed at 10-min intervals up to 1 h into the future, while the multilayer perceptron algorithm is accurate in predicting power over hour-long intervals up to 4 h ahead. Wind speed can be predicted fairly accurately based on its historical values; however, the power cannot be accurately determined given a power curve model and the predicted wind speed. Test computational results of all time series models and data mining algorithms are discussed. The tests were performed on data generated at a wind farm of 100 turbines.

Our approach assumes an existing multi-coset sampling. To date, recovery methods for this sampling strategy ensure perfect reconstruction either when the band locations are known, or under strict restrictions on the possible spectral supports. In this paper, only the number of bands and their widths are assumed without any other limitations on the support. We describe how to choose the parameters of the multi-coset sampling so that a unique multiband signal matches the given samples. To recover the signal, the continuous reconstruction is replaced by a single finite-dimensional problem without the need for discretization. The resulting problem is studied within the framework of compressed sensing, and thus can be solved efficiently using known tractable algorithms from this emerging area. We also develop a theoretical lower bound on the average sampling rate required for blind signal reconstruction, which is twice the minimal rate of known-spectrum recovery. Our method ensures perfect reconstruction for a wide class of signals sampled at the minimal rate, and provides a first systematic study of compressed sensing in a truly analog setting. Numerical experiments are presented demonstrating blind sampling and reconstruction with minimal sampling rate.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2012791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2012791","startPage":"993","endPage":"1009","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4783546/04749297.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Multiband Signal Reconstruction: Compressed Sensing for Analog Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Blind Multiband Signal Reconstruction: Compressed Sensing for Analog Signals","volume":"57","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10498811","publicationDate":"March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749297/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Multiband Signal Reconstruction: Compressed Sensing for Analog Signals","sourcePdf":"57tsp04-mmishali-2012791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121144S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4783546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"515","xplore-issue":"4783546","articleId":"4749297","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4749302,"authors":[{"name":"Yogananda Isukapalli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yogananda","lastName":"Isukapalli","id":"37295040700"},{"name":"Jun Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Broadcom Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37290251000"},{"name":"Bhaskar D.

Crosstalk cancellation techniques show great potential for enabling the next leap in DSL transmission rates. An important issue when implementing crosstalk cancelation techniques in hardware is the effect of finite word length on performance. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the performance of linear zero-forcing precoders, used for crosstalk compensation, in the presence of finite word length errors. We quantify analytically the tradeoff between precoder word length and transmission rate degradation. More specifically, we prove a simple formula for the transmission-rate loss as a function of the number of bits used for precoding, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the standard line parameters. We demonstrate, through simulations on real lines, the accuracy of our estimates. Moreover, our results are stable in the presence of channel estimation errors. Lastly, we show how to use these estimates as a design tool for DSL linear crosstalk precoders. For example, we show that for standard VDSL2 precoded systems, 14 bit representation of the precoder entries results in capacity loss below 1% for lines over 300 m.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749304/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749304/","accessionNumber":"10544141","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Finite Word Length Effects on Transmission Rate in Zero Forcing Linear Precoding for Multichannel DSL","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Word Length Effects on Transmission Rate in Zero Forcing Linear Precoding for Multichannel DSL","sourcePdf":"57tsp04-aleshem-2012889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102762S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4799349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4799349","articleId":"4749304","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749305,"authors":[{"name":"Ashok Patel","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Patel","id":"37544633500"},{"name":"Bart Kosko","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California USC, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Kosko","id":"37284621500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4749305","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":590},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749305","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Strontium","Sufficient conditions","Noise level","Testing","Medical signal detection","Signal to noise ratio","Upper bound","Stochastic resonance","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","noise","resonance","signal detection","statistical analysis","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal noise benefits","Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing","inequality-constrained statistical signal detection","stochastic resonance noise benefits","iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inequality-constrained signal detection","Neyman\u2013Pearson test","noise-finding algorithm","optimal noise","stochastic resonance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2012893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4814882/04749305.pdf","startPage":"1655","endPage":"1669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2012893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Noise Benefits in Neyman\u2013Pearson and Inequality-Constrained Statistical Signal Detection","abstract":"We present theorems and an algorithm to find optimal or near-optimal ldquostochastic resonancerdquo (SR) noise benefits for Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing and for more general inequality-constrained signal detection problems.

In this paper, we propose a blind channel shortening equalizer structure named blind, adaptive channel shortening equalizer which can provide the shortened channel state information (BACS-SI). The algorithm depends on the minimization of a cost function defined as the sum-squared difference of the autocorrelations of the shortened channel impulse response (CIR) and a target impulse response. The surface is proven to be multimodal; however, minima are shown to be related to each other in a certain way. A two-phase approach is proposed. In the first phase, the cost function is minimized by a stochastic gradient descent algorithm in order to find an arbitrary minimum. In the second phase using the relation between minima, genetic algorithms are employed to find the best minimum according to a fitness function. The algorithm can both successfully shorten the channel and also explicitly provides shortened CIR which is a necessary information for the proper operation of a MCM receiver, in contrast to many other algorithms proposed in the literature which cannot directly provide this information.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4799349/04749307.pdf","startPage":"1483","endPage":"1493","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2012897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2012897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind, Adaptive Channel Shortening Equalizer Algorithm Which Can Provide Shortened Channel State Information (BACS-SI)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749307/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Blind, Adaptive Channel Shortening Equalizer Algorithm Which Can Provide Shortened Channel State Information (BACS-SI)","htmlLink":"/document/4749307/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","accessionNumber":"10544142","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind, Adaptive Channel Shortening Equalizer Algorithm Which Can Provide Shortened Channel State Information (BACS-SI)","sourcePdf":"57tsp04-ctoker-2012897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062608S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4799349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4799349","articleId":"4749307","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749311,"authors":[{"name":"R.

MCSA is a method for motor diagnosis with stator-current signals. Although it is one of the most powerful online methods for diagnosing motor faults, it has some drawbacks that can degrade the performance and accuracy of a motor-diagnosis system. In particular, it is very difficult to detect broken rotor bars when the motor is operating at low slip or under no load, due to fast Fourier transform (FFT) frequency leakage and the small amplitude of the current components related to the fault. Therefore, advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms are proposed. They consist of a proper sample selection algorithm, a Hilbert transformation of the stator-sampled current, and spectral analysis via FFT of the modulus of the resultant time-dependent vector modulus for achieving MCSA efficiently. Experimental results obtained on a 1.1 kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor are discussed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2008.2003207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4785258","startPage":"52","endPage":"59","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4785258/04749311.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Resolution of the MCSA Method Via Hilbert Transform, Enabling the Diagnosis of Rotor Asymmetries at Very Low Slip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749311/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Resolution of the MCSA Method Via Hilbert Transform, Enabling the Diagnosis of Rotor Asymmetries at Very Low Slip","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10475508","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Resolution of the MCSA Method Via Hilbert Transform, Enabling the Diagnosis of Rotor Asymmetries at Very Low Slip","sourcePdf":"tec-riera-guasp-2003207.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162026S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4785258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"192","xplore-issue":"4785258","articleId":"4749311","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4749312,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Bevrani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kurdistan, Kurdistan, Iraq"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/4785258/4749312/4749312-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hassan Bevrani (S\u201990\u2013M\u201904\u2013SM\u201908) was born in Kurdistan, Iran.

We study the design of robust broadcasting schemes that minimize the transmission power necessary to guarantee that the QoS requirements are satisfied for all channels within bounded uncertainty regions around the transmitter's estimate of each user's channel. Each user's QoS requirement is formulated as a constraint on the mean square error (MSE) in its received signal, and we show that these MSE constraints imply constraints on the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Using the MSE constraints, we present a unified approach to the design of linear and nonlinear transceivers with QoS requirements that must be satisfied in the presence of bounded channel uncertainty. The proposed designs overcome the limitations of existing approaches that provide conservative designs or are only applicable to the case of linear precoding. Furthermore, we provide computationally efficient design formulations for a rather general model of bounded channel uncertainty that subsumes many natural choices for the uncertainty region. We also consider the problem of the robust counterpart to precoding schemes that maximize the fidelity of the weakest user's signal subject to a power constraint. For this problem, we provide quasi-convex formulations, for both linear and nonlinear transceivers, that can be efficiently solved using a one-dimensional bisection search. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the presence of bounded uncertainty in the transmitter's knowledge of users' channels, the proposed designs provide guarantees for a larger range of QoS requirements than the existing approaches that are based on bounded channel uncertainty models and require less transmission power to provide these guarantees.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2012904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4814882/04749313.pdf","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2012904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear and Linear Broadcasting With QoS Requirements: Tractable Approaches for Bounded Channel Uncertainties","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749313/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear and Linear Broadcasting With QoS Requirements: Tractable Approaches for Bounded Channel Uncertainties","volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10572983","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4749313/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear and Linear Broadcasting With QoS Requirements: Tractable Approaches for Bounded Channel Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"57tsp04-mshenouda-2012904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139599S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4814882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4814882","articleId":"4749313","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749315,"authors":[{"name":"Meindert Niemeijer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, IA, USA","Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Meindert","lastName":"Niemeijer","id":"37418440200"},{"name":"Michael D.

If, however, all relevant lesions in an image can be detected by CAD algorithms, use of CAD for automatic reading or prescreening may become feasible. This work addresses the question how to fuse information from multiple CAD algorithms, operating on multiple images that comprise an exam, to determine a likelihood that the exam is normal and would not require further inspection by human operators. We focus on retinal image screening for diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes. Current CAD systems are not designed to automatically evaluate complete exams consisting of multiple images for which several detection algorithm output sets are available. Information fusion will potentially play a crucial role in enabling the application of CAD technology to the automatic screening problem. Several different fusion methods are proposed and their effect on the performance of a complete comprehensive automatic diabetic retinopathy screening system is evaluated. Experiments show that the choice of fusion method can have a large impact on system performance. The complete system was evaluated on a set of 15 000 exams (60 000 images). The best performing fusion method obtained an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.881. This indicates that automated prescreening could be applied in diabetic retinopathy screening programs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749315/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601724","pubMedId":"19150786","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Information Fusion for Diabetic Retinopathy CAD in Digital Color Fundus Photographs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Fusion for Diabetic Retinopathy CAD in Digital Color Fundus Photographs","sourcePdf":"tmi-niemeijer-2012029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060628S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4897616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4897616","articleId":"4749315","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4749317,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel Matej","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Matej","id":"37268307100"},{"name":"Suleman Surti","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Suleman","lastName":"Surti","id":"37268399900"},{"name":"Shridhar Jayanthi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Shridhar","lastName":"Jayanthi","id":"37296080900"},{"name":"Margaret E.

However, their shortcomings are relatively high computational costs for reconstruction and for sensitivity matrix calculation. Efficient treatment of TOF data within the proposed DIRECT approach is obtained by 1) angular (azimuthal and co-polar) grouping of TOF events to a set of views as given by the angular sampling requirements for the TOF resolution, and 2) deposition (weighted-histogramming) of these grouped events, and correction data, into a set of ldquohisto-images,rdquo one histo-image per view. The histo-images have the same geometry (voxel grid, size and orientation) as the reconstructed image. The concept is similar to the approach involving binning of the TOF data into angularly subsampled histo-projections - projections expanded in the TOF directions. However, unlike binning into histo-projections, the deposition of TOF events directly into the image voxels eliminates the need for tracing and/or interpolation operations during the reconstruction. Together with the performance of reconstruction operations directly in image space, this leads to a very efficient implementation of TOF reconstruction algorithms. Furthermore, the resolution properties are not compromised either, since events are placed into the image elements of the desired size from the beginning. Concepts and efficiency of the proposed data partitioning scheme are demonstrated in this work by using the DIRECT approach in conjunction with the row-action maximum-likelihood (RAMLA) algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.2012034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4897616/04749317.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.2012034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897616","startPage":"739","endPage":"751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient 3-D TOF PET Reconstruction Using View-Grouped Histo-Images: DIRECT\u2014Direct Image Reconstruction for TOF","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient 3-D TOF PET Reconstruction Using View-Grouped Histo-Images: DIRECT\u2014Direct Image Reconstruction for TOF","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749317/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601726","pubMedId":"19150784","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749317/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient 3-D TOF PET Reconstruction Using View-Grouped Histo-Images: DIRECT\u2014Direct Image Reconstruction for TOF","sourcePdf":"tmi-matej-2012034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.266564S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4897616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4897616","articleId":"4749317","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749320,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhong Zuo","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronics, Shanxi University, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jianhong","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37663597200"},{"name":"Xinwei Chen","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronics, Shanxi University, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xinwei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536407800"},{"name":"Guorui Han","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronics, Shanxi University, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Guorui","lastName":"Han","id":"37395782700"},{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronics, Shanxi University, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li","id":"37578912000"},{"name":"Wenmei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronics, Shanxi University, Shanxi, China","School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wenmei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37404207800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4749320","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3039},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Band pass filters","Impedance","Bandwidth","Circuits","Resonator filters","Low pass filters","Microstrip antennas","Microstrip filters","Patch antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","radiofrequency filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF antenna-filter co-design","microstrip patch antenna","hairpin filter","interfaces impedance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna","co-design","filter"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a co-designed antenna-filter is presented.

A computationally efficient technique for multiple wideband source localization is presented in this paper using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in the near field of a sensor array/area. Our basic idea is to decompose the recorded sensor data, which is a superimposition of multiple sources, into individual components in the frequency domain and then separately estimate the corresponding location parameters associated with each source. Instead of the conventional alternating projection (AP) method, we propose to adopt the EM algorithm in this paper; our method involves two steps, namely, Expectation (E-step) and Maximization (M-step). In the E-step, the individual incident source waveforms are estimated. Then, in the M-step, the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the source-location parameters are obtained. These two steps are iteratively and alternatively executed until the user's predefined convergence is reached. The computational complexity comparison between our proposed EM algorithm and the existing AP scheme is also investigated. Provably, it is shown through Monte Carlo simulations that the computational complexity of the proposed EM algorithm is significantly lower than that of the conventional AP scheme. We also derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the source-location estimates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Robust EM Algorithm for Multiple Wideband Source Localization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2012495","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5062310/04749325.pdf","startPage":"3071","endPage":"3075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2012495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749325/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Robust EM Algorithm for Multiple Wideband Source Localization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10712998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Robust EM Algorithm for Multiple Wideband Source Localization","sourcePdf":"tvt-wu-2012495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033672S","chronDate":"July  2009","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","articleId":"4749325","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4749335,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The novelty of this study is to utilize two types of nanojunction devices with CMOS to build the crypto IC. In particular, efficient XOR gate with resistive junctions and XOR/AND gates with diode-like junctions are develop to be used as building blocks of the corresponding modules of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) crypto IC. They allow a reduction of 79%, 43%, and 53% in power dissipation, area, and time delay compared to the existing CMOL implementation of AES system. When compared to field-programmable nanowire interconnect (FPNI) design of AES, a 56% increase in power dissipation was recorded in order to achieve a 92% and 15% reduction in area and time delay. This proposed circuit study also leverages the recent fabrication results, which is a feasible CMOS-nano hybrid solution for future crypto IC development.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/4912712/04749335.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2008.2011812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2008.2011812","startPage":"315","endPage":"321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient CMOL Gate Designs for Cryptography Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749335/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient CMOL Gate Designs for Cryptography Applications","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4749335/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"10630562","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient CMOL Gate Designs for Cryptography Applications","sourcePdf":"tnano-abid-2011812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069029S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"4912712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4912712","articleId":"4749335","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4749337,"authors":[{"name":"Naoki Inomata","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering and Robotics, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Inomata","id":"37397379700"},{"name":"Yoko Yamanishi","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering and Robotics, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoko","lastName":"Yamanishi","id":"37295097600"},{"name":"Fumihito Arai","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering and Robotics, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumihito","lastName":"Arai","id":"37274069600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-125X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0085"}],"articleNumber":"4749337","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nanotechnology Council","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/nanotech/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749337","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical microscopy","Carbon nanotubes","Microfluidics","Fluorescence","Energy exchange","Photobleaching","Dielectrophoresis","Electrodes","Conducting materials","Optical materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","electrophoresis","indium compounds","microfluidics","optical microscopes","optical saturable absorption","tin compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic chip","carbon nanotubes","water","optical microscope","quenching observation","fluorescent reagents","fluorescence photobleaching","polydimethylsiloxane","porous structure","microstirrer","dielectrophoretic force","indium tin oxide","C","ITO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)","fluorescent image","microchannel","microfabrication"]}],"abstract":"We successfully manipulated and observed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in water, under an optical microscope. We employed a quenching observation method, where the intensity of fluorescent reagents around CNTs is decreased due to energy transfer. By this method, CNTs can be observed continuously for a long time by adding a new fluorescent reagent after fluorescence photobleaching. However, we must adjust the density of the fluorescent reagent around CNTs, which is extremely difficult to control. Thus, we built a fluorescent reagent supply system in a microfluidic chip. We found that polydimethylsiloxane with a porous structure could absorb the fluorescent reagent as a carrier and supply the reagent at a high and constant density for a long time. In experiments, using a microstirrer, we mixed two fluids uniformly, and succeeded in controlling the density of the fluorescent reagent. In addition, we applied dielectrophoretic (DEP) force for trapping the CNTs. The electrode material was indium-tin oxide, which is suitable for manipulation and observation of CNTs under an optical microscope because of its high conductive properties and good transparency. In these experiments, we trapped CNTs by DEP and observed CNTs by quenching on the chip, and confirmed that the fluorescent image of the CNTs was clearer than their bright-field images.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5165202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2008.2012346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5165202/04749337.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"468","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2008.2012346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Manipulation and Observation of Carbon Nanotubes in Water Under an Optical Microscope Using a Microfluidic Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","displayDocTitle":"Manipulation and Observation of Carbon Nanotubes in Water Under an Optical Microscope Using a Microfluidic Chip","volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4749337/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10764128","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Manipulation and Observation of Carbon Nanotubes in Water Under an Optical Microscope Using a Microfluidic Chip","sourcePdf":"tnano-inomata-2012346.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085821S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5165202","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5165202","articleId":"4749337","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4749344,"authors":[{"name":"Steven F.

Advancements in pulsed-power technologies are enabling system designs that allow for greater flexibility such as programmable current shaping. Material science, which uses current pulse shaping to obtain data for the equation of state analysis, is driving much of this work. The programming of pulsed-power systems through the use of simulations and manual curve fitting techniques can work well for systems that only have a few controllable parameters and are generating waveforms with simple spectral content. Complex systems with many controllable parameters become unmanageable for manual trial and error to be effective. This paper discusses the characterization and modeling of a scaled down programmable current adder directed at investigating technical issues that will be encountered in full-scale drivers. A discussion of the procedure used to optimize the adder current output, using genetic algorithms, is presented. The approach to system programmability presented in this paper will allow for a more simplified user interface and system control, as the requirements for flexibility and complexity in future systems increase.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2008.925637","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/4776550/04749344.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"346","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2008.925637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Optimization for Pulsed-Power System Configuration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Optimization for Pulsed-Power System Configuration","volume":"37","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10429343","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749344/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Optimization for Pulsed-Power System Configuration","sourcePdf":"tps-glover-925637.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116408S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"4776550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4776550","articleId":"4749344","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749359,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Cataliotti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 di Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Antonio Cataliotti (M'01) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy, in 1992 and 1998, respectively.","In 2000, he was an Assistant Professor with the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, University of Palermo, where he has been an Associate Professor of electrical and electronic measurements since 2005.

A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to adjust the network's weights in the training phase of the ANNs. The advantage of using a PSO algorithm over other conventional training algorithms such as the back-propagation (BP) is that potential solutions will be flown through the problem hyperspace with accelerated movement towards the best solution. Thus the training phase should result in obtaining the weights configuration associated with the minimum output error. Data are wavelet transformed during the preprocessing stage and then inserted into the neural network to extract redundant information from the load curve. This results in better load characterization which creates a more reliable forecasting model. The transformed data of historical load and weather information were trained and tested over various periods of time. The generalized error estimation is done by using the reverse part of the data as a ldquotestrdquo set. The results were compared with traditional BP algorithm and offered a high forecasting precision.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4762160/04749374.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"27","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2008606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2008606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4762160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying Wavelets to Short-Term Load Forecasting Using PSO-Based Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Neural networks","Weather forecasting","Artificial neural networks","Adaptive systems","Particle swarm optimization","Acceleration","Data mining","Predictive models","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","error analysis","load forecasting","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","regression analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","particle swarm optimization","PSO-based neural networks","adaptive artificial neural networks","backpropagation","wavelet transform","generalized error estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hourly load forecasting","neural networks","particle swarm optimization","wavelet transform","weighted multiple linear regression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Applying Wavelets to Short-Term Load Forecasting Using PSO-Based Neural Networks","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4749374/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10416786","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying Wavelets to Short-Term Load Forecasting Using PSO-Based Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-bashir-2008606.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096545S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4762160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"271","xplore-issue":"4762160","articleId":"4749374","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749383,"authors":[{"name":"Stefanos Zafeiriou","affiliation":["Imperial College London, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Communications and Signal Processing Research Group, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4776562/4749383/4749383-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefanos Zafeiriou was born in Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1981.

NMF requires the object tensor (with valence more than one) to be vectorized. This procedure may result in information loss since the local object structure is lost due to vectorization. Recently, in order to remedy this disadvantage of NMF methods, nonnegative tensor factorizations (NTF) algorithms that can be applied directly to the tensor representation of object collections have been introduced. In this paper, we propose a series of unsupervised and supervised NTF methods. That is, we extend several NMF methods using arbitrary valence tensors. Moreover, by incorporating discriminant constraints inside the NTF decompositions, we present a series of discriminant NTF methods. The proposed approaches are tested for face verification and facial expression recognition, where it is shown that they outperform other popular subspace approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2005293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4776562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2005293","endPage":"235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4776562/04749383.pdf","startPage":"217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminant Nonnegative Tensor Factorization Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749383/","displayDocTitle":"Discriminant Nonnegative Tensor Factorization Algorithms","volume":"20","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10471901","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2009","pubMedId":"19150796","htmlLink":"/document/4749383/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminant Nonnegative Tensor Factorization Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tnn-zafeiriou-2005293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126876S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4776562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4776562","articleId":"4749383","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749384,"authors":[{"name":"John F.

These tests used a wide-area measurement system (WAMS) based primarily on phasor measurement units (PMUs) to determine response to events including the insertion of the 1400-MW Chief Joseph braking resistor, probing signals, and ambient events. Test security was reinforced through real-time analysis of wide-area effects, and high-quality data provided dynamic profiles for interarea modes across the entire western interconnection. The tests established that low-level optimized pseudo-random plusmn20 -MW probing with the pacific DC intertie (PDCI) roughly doubles the apparent noise that is natural to the power system, providing sharp dynamic information with negligible interference to system operations. Such probing is an effective alternative to use of the 1400-MW Chief Joseph dynamic brake, and it is under consideration as a standard means for assessing dynamic security.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.2009429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power

The measurements from the test chip showed that the fabricated imager allows wide dynamic range (WDR) operation in a snapshot readout mode. This DR extension has become possible due to a unique in-pixel architecture allowing automatic adaptation of each pixel in the array to its illumination level.

However, in the uplink, the difference in the transmit timing among the signals from multiple mobile terminals (MTs) becomes significant. If the arrival timing difference among MTs exceeds the cyclic prefix (CP) length, it is difficult to separate the signal of each MT, and the transmission quality is severely degraded due to the effect of interblock interference (IBI). In this paper, we propose a novel multiuser detection (MUD) technique that can separate the signals, regardless of the arrival timing differences between the MTs. The proposed MUD technique is performed in the frequency domain by overlapping the fast Fourier transform (FFT) blocks, and the technique can suppress the effect of the IBI while retaining a low complexity level. The achievable bit error rate (BER) performance is evaluated by computer simulation in a frequency-selective fading channel, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749421/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10712997","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Detection for Asynchronous Broadband Single-Carrier Transmission Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Detection for Asynchronous Broadband Single-Carrier Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-ishihara-2012716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06932S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4749421","onlineDate":"13 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749425,"authors":[{"name":"Angelia Nedic","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/4749422/4749425/4749425-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Angelia Nedi\u0107 received the B.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro, in 1987, the M.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia, in 1990, the Ph.D. degree in mathematics and mathematical physics from Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2002.","She was with the BAE Systems Advanced Information Technology from 2002 to 2006.

Good examples of this approach include cepstral mean subtraction, and cepstral mean and variance normalization, in which either the first or both the first and the second moments of the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are normalized. In this paper, we propose the family of higher order cepstral moment normalization, in which the MFCC parameters are normalized with respect to a few moments of orders higher than 1 or 2. The basic idea is that the higher order moments are more dominated by samples with larger values, which are very likely the primary sources of the asymmetry and abnormal flatness or tail size of the parameter distributions. Normalization with respect to these moments therefore puts more emphasis on these signal components and constrains the distributions to be more symmetric with more reasonable flatness and tail size.

The performance of the SGMM algorithm depends on the proper choice of the sorting function, and the proper adjustment of its parameters. In the present work, we employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) and an appropriate fitness function to find the most advantageous parameters of the sorting function. We evaluate the practical significance of our approach on the text-independent speaker verification task utilizing the NIST 2002 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) database while following the NIST SRE experimental protocol. The experimental results demonstrate a superior performance of the SGMM algorithm using PSO when compared to the original SGMM. For comprehensiveness we also compared these results with those from a baseline Gaussian mixture model-universal background model (GMM-UBM) system. The experimental results suggest that the performance loss due to speed-up is partially mitigated using PSO-derived weights in a sorted GMM-based scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2010278","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4749447/04749468.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"353","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2010278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Sorted Adapted Gaussian Mixture Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Sorted Adapted Gaussian Mixture Models","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10399788","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749468/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization for Sorted Adapted Gaussian Mixture Models","sourcePdf":"17tasl02-rsaeidi-2010278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057432S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4749447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4749447","articleId":"4749468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4749471,"authors":[{"name":"Takuya Yoshioka","affiliation":["NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4749447/4749471/4749471-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takuya Yoshioka (M'08) received the B.E. and M.Inf. degrees from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.","From 2005 to 2006, he was a Trainee at NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Kyoto.

The following conditions are assumed. 1) Short-time spectral components of speech and noise are statistically independent Gaussian random variables. 2) A room's convolutive system is modeled as an autoregressive system in each frequency band. 3) A short-time power spectral density of speech is modeled as an all-pole spectrum, while that of noise is assumed to be time-invariant and known in advance. Under these conditions, the proposed method estimates the parameters of the convolutive system and those of the all-pole speech model based on the maximum likelihood estimation method. The estimated parameters are then used to calculate the minimum mean square error estimates of the speech spectral components. The proposed method has two significant features. 1) The parameter estimation part performs noise suppression and dereverberation alternately. (2) Noise-free reverberant speech spectrum estimates, which are transferred by the noise suppression process to the dereverberation process, are represented in the form of a probability distribution.

Although HMMs are a natural choice to warp the time axis and model the temporal phenomena in the speech signal, their conditional independence properties limit their ability to model spectral phenomena well. In this paper, a new acoustic modeling paradigm based on augmented conditional random fields (ACRFs) is investigated and developed. This paradigm addresses some limitations of HMMs while maintaining many of the aspects which have made them successful. In particular, the acoustic modeling problem is reformulated in a data driven, sparse, augmented space to increase discrimination. Acoustic context modeling is explicitly integrated to handle the sequential phenomena of the speech signal. We present an efficient framework for estimating these models that ensures scalability and generality. In the TIMIT phone recognition task, a phone error rate of 23.0% was recorded on the full test set, a significant improvement over comparable HMM-based systems.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4749447/04749472.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech Recognition Using Augmented Conditional Random Fields","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.2010286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.2010286","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Speech Recognition Using Augmented Conditional Random Fields","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10391686","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4749472/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech Recognition Using Augmented Conditional Random Fields","sourcePdf":"17tasl02-yhifny-2010286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116108S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4749447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4749447","articleId":"4749472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4749497,"authors":[{"name":"Zhisheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhisheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537904700"},{"name":"Zixin Chen","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zixin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37655102800"},{"name":"Jinfei Shi","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinfei","lastName":"Shi","id":"37612961200"},{"name":"Fang Jia","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Jia","id":"37647482000"},{"name":"Min Dai","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Dai","id":"37652921700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3779-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-473-13532-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4749497","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rough surfaces","Surface roughness","Machine vision","Surface resistance","Mechanical variables measurement","Image analysis","Surface finishing","Mechatronics","Mechanical engineering","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","computer vision","grinding","image colour analysis","matrix algebra","production engineering computing","surface roughness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface roughness vision measurement","ambient light conditions","machine vision method","grinding axes","gray-level cooccurrence matrix","calibration stage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["measurement","ambient light","machine vision","surface"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749497","abstract":"Machine vision method was used to measure the surface roughness for different Phi38 mm grinding axes in different ambient light conditions.

At the calibration stage, the intensity of ambient light was put into consideration to indicate the relationship between the surface roughness and the corresponding features of the workpiece image. To measure an unknown workpiece, the corresponding features of ambient light and inspected workpiece would be input to calculate the roughness value.

A high speed vision system involves grabbing image frames from a single or multiple sensors and processing of the data in a limited time. Therefore, the requirement of real-time processing of the images is the key problem in dealing with such applications. Moreover, to obtain the best performance, it is vital that algorithms and hardware of a vision system be reconfigurable and flexible. A FPGA-based system was devoted to the design of vision system for robots. It offers the required features for robots' vision system such as; parallel processing of the video images, good computational power, low cost and reconfigurable hardware. The image processing component of the proposed vision system consists of one core processor for implementing the software part and up to eight functional units for the hardware implementation part. The core processor controls and communicates with the functional units. The mixed hardware/software method utilises the advantages of both hardware and software techniques. The implementation of a normal filter with a coefficient matrix of 3 times 3 as applied to a 64 times 64 image is chosen as an example. It can be verified that the multiplication operations for implementing such filter are independent and therefore can be run simultaneously. The addition operations can be done when the multiplication results are available. Therefore, the core processor can perform all parallel operations in order to minimise the total number of implementation stages.","doi":"10.1109/MMVIP.2008.4749511","publicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740203/4749496/04749511.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMVIP.2008.4749511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High Speed Vision System for Robots Using FPGA Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749511/","displayDocTitle":"A High Speed Vision System for Robots Using FPGA Technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10457401","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4749511/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High Speed Vision System for Robots Using FPGA Technology","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"MMVIP-00-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083839S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740203","isNumber":"4749496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740203","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4749496","articleId":"4749511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Intl Journal of Intelligent","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4749546,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Cong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Cong","id":"37542149200"},{"name":"Xiaofei Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085965004"},{"name":"Peter Xu","affiliation":["School of Engineering Advanced Technology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Xu","id":"37627169800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3779-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-473-13532-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4749546","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749546","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Genetic algorithms","Acceleration","Orbital robotics","Mathematics","Mathematical model","Fuzzy control","Robot motion","Motion planning","Minimax techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","minimax techniques","motion control","position control","robot kinematics","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-jerk synthetic optimal trajectory planning","fuzzy genetic algorithm","joint space scheme","cubic splines","constraint condition","robot motion","mathematical model","minimax approach","kinematics constraints","upper bound","fuzzy control rules","real-coding approach","elitism approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time-jerk","trajectory planning","cubic splines","fuzzy genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MMVIP.2008.4749546","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740203/4749496/04749546.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice","startPage":"274","endPage":"279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMVIP.2008.4749546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Jerk Synthetic Optimal Trajectory Planning of Robot Based on Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"A new approach based on fuzzy genetic algorithm is developed to find the time-jerk synthetic optimal trajectory of robot with a joint space scheme using cubic splines.

Based on cubic splines, the mathematic model of time-jerk synthetic optimal trajectory planning is built taking into account both the execution time and minimax approach of jerk with kinematics constraints expressed as upper bounds on the absolute values of velocity and acceleration. For solving the mathematic model, we designed the set of fuzzy control rules and fuzzy genetic algorithm, using real-coding and elitism approach.

These applications vary from command and control instruments, video conferencing to robotics. However, their performance decreases when the acquired speech signal is corrupted by background noise. Numerous research has been done in the last two decades to improve their performance. The switched Griffiths-Jim beamformer is one of the well known methods used to reduce background noise (or interference). This algorithm makes use of two adaptive filters and a voice activity detector. The first filter is used as a beam-steering filter which is updated during speech signals and the second filter is used as a noise cancellation filter which is updated during a noise-alone signal. A voice activity detector is used to control the updates of these adaptive filters. Generally, the normalised least mean squares (NLMS) algorithm is used for the adaptive filters. However, it is found that the convergence rate of the NLMS deteriorates for coloured noise under certain non-stationary conditions where the correlation matrix is \"stiff\". It has been found that the affine projection algorithm will perform better under these conditions. Therefore, a comparison of these two adaptive filters in this beamformer structure will be discussed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/MMVIP.2008.4749565","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice","pdfPath":"/iel5/4740203/4749496/04749565.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMVIP.2008.4749565","publicationTitle":"2008 15th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice","startPage":"391","endPage":"396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switched Griffiths-Jim beamformer using the affine projection algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Switched Griffiths-Jim beamformer using the affine projection algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749565/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4749565/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10457455","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switched Griffiths-Jim beamformer using the affine projection algorithm","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"MMVIP-00-69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0439S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4740203","isNumber":"4749496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4740203","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4749496","articleId":"4749565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Intl Journal of Intelligent","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4749606,"authors":[{"name":"Aiguo Patrick Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Aiguo Patrick","lastName":"Hu","id":"37333450600"},{"name":"Chao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406601100"},{"name":"Hao Leo Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Hao Leo","lastName":"Li","id":"37293380500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3779-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-473-13532-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4749606","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":100,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1849},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Coupling circuits","Robotics and automation","Voltage","Mechatronics","Machine vision","Robot vision systems","Electromagnetic interference","Frequency conversion","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","battery powered vehicles","electromagnetic interference","inductive power transmission","mobile robots","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contactless battery charging system","soccer playing robot","capacitive power transfer technology","intervention-free energy replenishment system","battery charging station","inductive power transfer technology","CPT technology","metal barriers","electromagnetic interference","system design","power converter","high frequency electric field generation","primary circuit","pick-up battery charging"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel contactless battery charging system using capacitive power transfer (CPT) technology.

When the battery level of a soccer playing robot is detected to be low, it is navigated to the battery charging station to charge up automatically. Although inductive power transfer (IPT) technology has been investigated for such an application, the CPT technology provides a new solution which can transfer power across metal barriers and reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). This paper covers system design of a power converter for high frequency electric field generation, proper coupling between the primary circuit and the power pick-up on board the robot, as well as the pick-up battery charging.

The proposed decoding scheme provides constant-time decoding and thus facilitates real-time applications where guaranteed data rate is required. It analyzes each received data frame to estimate the maximum number of necessary iterations for frame convergence. The results are then used to dynamically adjust decoder frequency and switch between multiple-voltage levels; thereby energy use is minimized. It differs from recent publications on speculative LDPC decoding for block-fading channels. Our approach addresses the more difficult problem of decoding requirement prediction for data frames in AWGN channels. It is also directly applicable for fading channels. A decoder architecture utilizing offset min-sum layered decoding algorithm is presented. Up to 30% saving in decoding energy consumption is achieved with negligible coding performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.68","publicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749609/4749610/04749652.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power VLSI Design of LDPC Decoder Using DVFS for AWGN Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power VLSI Design of LDPC Decoder Using DVFS for AWGN Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749652/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10399906","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4749652/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power VLSI Design of LDPC Decoder Using DVFS for AWGN Channels","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"3506a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060862S","chronDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4749609","isNumber":"4749610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749609","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4749610","articleId":"4749652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4749662,"authors":[{"name":"Sreehari Veeramachanen","affiliation":["Centre of VLSI and Embedded System Technologies(CVEST), International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Sreehari","lastName":"Veeramachanen","id":"38257618200"},{"name":"A.

Rounding can also be added to the design to restore some accuracy at a slight cost in area.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749609/4749610/04749685.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","doi":"10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Implementation of Floating-Point Reciprocator on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Delay","Floating-point arithmetic","Table lookup","Very large scale integration","Costs","Signal synthesis","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating-point reciprocator","FPGA","single-precision floating point numbers","double-precision floating point numbers","look-up tables","partial block multipliers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Floating-point arithmetic","reciprocator","FPGA","double-precision","partial block-multipliers","binomial expansion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Implementation of Floating-Point Reciprocator on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4749685/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10399935","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","conferenceDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Implementation of Floating-Point Reciprocator on FPGA","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"3506a267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077967S","chronDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4749609","isNumber":"4749610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749609","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4749610","articleId":"4749685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4749687,"authors":[{"name":"Nilanjan Mukherjee","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Nilanjan","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37326892000"},{"name":"Artur Pogiel","affiliation":["Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Artur","lastName":"Pogiel","id":"37395560700"},{"name":"Janusz Rajski","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Rajski","id":"37273805300"},{"name":"Jerzy Tyszer","affiliation":["Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Tyszer","id":"37282711300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3506-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-9667"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2380-6923"}],"articleNumber":"4749687","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749687","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Counting circuits","Embedded system","Polynomials","Ring generators","Roentgenium","Linear feedback shift registers","Clocks","Very large scale integration","Graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit feedback","counting circuits","embedded systems","high-speed integrated circuits","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed on-chip event counter","embedded system","linear feedback shift register","ring generators","discrete event counters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ring generators","discrete event counters","LFSR simulation","embedded systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.15","publicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749609/4749610/04749687.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed On-Chip Event Counters for Embedded Systems","abstract":"The paper presents new discrete event counters that are based on ring generators - high performance linear feedback shift registers.

While a faulty manufacturing leads to a nonfunctional device, effect of an external implant can be far more detrimental. Therefore, effective detection and diagnosis of such maligned ICs in the post silicon testing phase is imperative, if the parts are intended to be used in mission critical applications. We propose a novel sustained vector methodology that proves to be very effective in detecting the presence of a Trojan in an IC. Each vector is repeated multiple times at the input of both the genuine and the Trojan circuits that ensures the reduction of extraneous toggles within the genuine circuit. Regions showing wide variations in the power behavior are analyzed to isolate the infected gate(s). Experimental results on ISCAS benchmark circuits show that this approach can magnify the behavioral difference between a genuine and infected IC up to thirty times as compared to the previous approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749695/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10399943","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Sustained Vector Technique for the Detection of Hardware Trojans","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Sustained Vector Technique for the Detection of Hardware Trojans","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"3506a327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054535S","chronDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4749609","isNumber":"4749610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749609","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4749610","articleId":"4749695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4749698,"authors":[{"name":"J.

One of the major contributions of this paper is the proposal for implementation of the decision function using only fixed point arithmetic without compromising the recognition accuracy. Compared to the scheme which uses floating point arithmetic, the proposed scheme reduces the number of LEs required by a factor of 3.29. The second scheme proposed results in about 25 times lower area compared to the first scheme. For the soft-core processor approach, a custom instruction is proposed for floating point arithmetic. Speaker dependent TI46 database of isolated digits is used for training and testing. Features are extracted using both Linear Predictive Coefficients (LPC) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC) and features are compressed using Self Organized Feature Mapping (SOFM). This in turn is used by the SVM classifier to evaluate the recognition accuracy and the hardware resources utilized. Both the schemes proposed result in 100% recognition accuracy when implemented on Altera Cyclone II FPGA. The proposed schemes can also be used for speaker verification and speaker authentication applications. Since the scheme which uses soft-core processor requires lower area, it can be used for systems which require a large vocabulary size.","publicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749609/4749610/04749698.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.23","doi":"10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Support Vector Machine Based Isolated Digit Recognition System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Support Vector Machine Based Isolated Digit Recognition System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749698/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749698/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10399946","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of Support Vector Machine Based Isolated Digit Recognition System","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"3506a347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065667S","chronDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4749609","isNumber":"4749610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749609","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4749610","articleId":"4749698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4749710,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Amratlal Thakker","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh Amratlal","lastName":"Thakker","id":"37392097800"},{"name":"M.

PVT (process, voltage, temperature) variations are considered during the design of circuits. We show that HPSO algorithm converges to a better solution, compared to PSO and GA. For CMOS Miller OTA, even performance of the circuit designed by HPSO algorithm is better than the performance of recently reported manually designed circuit. For the first time, design of this OTA, in 0.4 V supply voltage, is also presented. For this new design, HPSO algorithm has taken 23.5 minutes of CPU time on a Sun system with 1.2 GHz processor and 8 GB RAM.","publicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 22nd International Conference on VLSI Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/4749609/4749610/04749710.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power Low-Voltage Analog Circuit Design Using Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization","doi":"10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI.Design.2009.14","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power Low-Voltage Analog Circuit Design Using Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10399956","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749710/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power Low-Voltage Analog Circuit Design Using Hierarchical Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"3506a427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065384S","chronDate":"5-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"4749609","isNumber":"4749610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4749609","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4749610","articleId":"4749710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4749750,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Dusit Niyato [S'05] is currently an assistant professor in the School of Computer Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Cognitive radio networks are designed based on the concept of dynamic spectrum sharing where cognitive radio users can opportunistically share the radio spectrum. For example, in case of vertical spectrum sharing, a spectrum owner (or primary user/service) can share (or sell) its licensed spectrum with (to) other users (i.e., secondary users/services). The economics of spectrum sharing, which is referred to as spectrum trading, is the focus of this article. The objective of spectrum trading is to maximize the revenue of the spectrum owner, and at the same time enhance the satisfaction of the cognitive radio users. We first discuss the different network architectures and protocol behaviors for dynamic spectrum sharing as well as the spectrum sharing models. Then the scope of spectrum trading is discussed in the context of different spectrum sharing models. The primary research issues related to spectrum trading in cognitive radio networks are outlined, and the possible solution approaches are discussed. To this end, we introduce a market-equilibrium-based spectrum trading mechanism that uses spectrum demand and supply of the primary and secondary users, respectively. Since spectrum supply is stochastic in nature, a distributed and adaptive learning algorithm is used for the secondary users to estimate spectrum price and adjust the spectrum demand accordingly so that the market equilibrium can be reached.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2008.4749750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/4749736/04749750.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2008.4749750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749736","startPage":"71","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum trading in cognitive radio networks: A market-equilibrium-based approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum trading in cognitive radio networks: A market-equilibrium-based approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749750/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"December 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4749750/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum trading in cognitive radio networks: A market-equilibrium-based approach","sourcePdf":"014HOSSAINLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085744S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4749736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"4749736","articleId":"4749750","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4749751,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this article, we propose CogNet -- a cognitive complete knowledge network system -- which makes use of a large amount of information that can be gained from the experience of each node to improve the overall network and user performance. CogNet gathers, processes, analyzes, and stores information available through a variety of devices and protocols to build an omnipresent, distributed repository that holds the spatiotemporal, network-experience information. The inexpensiveness and plentifulness of storage resources and increasing processing power in handheld devices help accelerate the development of CogNet-like systems. Our contribution in this article is the proposal of the architecture and of the communication elements, as well as a transport layer application of CogNet as a proof of concept for possible application scenarios of such a system. We also present performance evaluation of CogTCP, the CogNetenabled TCP, which exploits the transport layer experience of other nodes for improved performance. From our experiments, we found that the use of cognitive information is very useful for networking.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/4749736/04749751.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"88","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2008.4749751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2008.4749751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4749751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CogNet: a cognitive complete knowledge network system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cognitive radio","Storage area networks","Wireless networks","Design optimization","Interference","Inference algorithms","Data mining","Statistical learning","Femtocell networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4749751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2008","displayDocTitle":"CogNet: a cognitive complete knowledge network system","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4749751/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CogNet: a cognitive complete knowledge network system","sourcePdf":"015ZORZILAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051053S","chronDate":"December  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4749736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4749736","articleId":"4749751","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
