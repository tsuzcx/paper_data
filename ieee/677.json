An (n, n) analysis shows that despite the n received waves interfering randomly, capacity grows linearly with n and is enormous. With n = 8 at 1% outage and 21-dB average SNR at each receiving element, 42 b/s/Hz is achieved. The capacity is more than 40 times that of a (1, 1) system at the same total radiated transmitter power and bandwidth. Moreover, in some applications, n could be much larger than 8. In striving for significant fractions of such huge capacities, the question arises: Can one construct an (n, n) system whose capacity scales linearly with n, using as building blocks n separately coded one-dimensional (1-D) subsystems of equal capacity? With the aim of leveraging the already highly developed 1-D codec technology, this paper reports just such an invention. In this new architecture, signals are layered in space and time as suggested by a tight capacity bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Autumn  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Autumn  1996","volume":"1","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Autumn 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Layered space-time architecture for wireless communication in a fading environment when using multi-element antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered space-time architecture for wireless communication in a fading environment when using multi-element antennas","sourcePdf":"bltj1241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036587S","chronDate":"Autumn  1996","isNumber":"6770090","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"3276","articleId":"6770094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6770095,"authors":[{"name":"I Chih-Lin","affiliation":["Communications Science Research Lab at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey"],"firstName":"I","lastName":"Chih-Lin"},{"name":"Charles A.

A backward-compatible system, known as multicode CDMA (MC-CDMA), has been proposed as a mechanism to allow higher-rate services under the IS-95 infrastructure. MC-CDMA enables dynamic packet-like user access with low overhead and high efficiency. This paper describes MC-CDMA and focuses on several issues related to its implementation, exploring both high-level system design and details of hardware implementation. The load- and interference-based demand assignment (LIDA) access control mechanism allows dynamic data rate access by balancing and controlling mixed traffic interference in a CDMA system. LIDA builds on existing pilot measurement and soft handoff protocols and thus can be integrated easily with IS-95. Also discussed are forward link interference suppression schemes that mitigate multipath impairments, resulting in increased capacity and/or improving quality. The paper concludes by describing an efficient design for a bidirectional 56-kb/s MC-CDMA mobile transceiver that requires only minimally increased complexity when compared with a conventional CDMA tranceiver. Together with all these enhancements, MC-CDMA provides a simple and effective transition mechanism for future wireless multimedia services.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.2016","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6770090/06770095.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.2016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IS-95 enhancements for multimedia services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Autumn  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Autumn  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770095/","displayDocTitle":"IS-95 enhancements for multimedia services","volume":"1","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Autumn 1996","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IS-95 enhancements for multimedia services","sourcePdf":"bltj1260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017631S","chronDate":"Autumn  1996","isNumber":"6770090","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"18","articleId":"6770095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6770140,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This technique is called the controllability, observability, and maintenance engineering technique, or COMET. Using graph-theoretical analysis, one can systematically apply COMET to a proposed or an existing digital system to determine the placement of control, access, and monitor points for diagnostic testing. In addition, it provides a means of studying the trade-offs between fault resolvability and the cost of maintenance hardware and/or packaging. COMET offers an orderly approach to implementing an overall diagnostic design by providing guidelines in early design stages. A design developed using COMET has the following advantages: trouble location manual data can be generated without the use of fault simulation, multiple faults and/or nonclassical faults are locatable if they are detectable, and diagnostic or trouble-location information can be easily updated in accordance with hardware changes. Studies indicate that applying COMET to an existing processor design would require a modest increase in hardware of less than 10 percent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1974","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 1974","volume":"53","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lamp: Controllability, observability, and maintenance engineering technique (comet)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lamp: Controllability, observability, and maintenance engineering technique (comet)","sourcePdf":"bstj5381505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01815S","chronDate":"Oct.  1974","isNumber":"6770136","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6770140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6770179,"authors":[{"name":"Robin J.

Effective countermeasures must minimize the risks induced by these attacks, noting that the risk is evaluated as a function of the success likelihood and the impact of an attack. In this paper, we demonstrate how to dynamically calculate the success likelihood (SL) for an ongoing attack by considering the progress of an attacker towards his objective.

Mobile broadband access to cloud-based computing power improves the flexibility of these networks. Modern public safety networks must support endpoints such as wireless laptops, handheld computers, and mobile video cameras, as well as facilitate communication, collaboration, and operation with central command posts, coworkers, and other agencies in order to provide situational awareness and optimized operations. Unattended video surveillance and sensor systems also use public service networks to transport control information and data. This combination of interconnectivity and interoperability of endpoints, communications, coworkers, agencies, video surveillance, and sensor systems results in a complex automated information system and introduces new security risks into public safety networks. First responders and public safety personnel are familiar with controls such as encryption, redundancy, and physical security used to protect traditional public safety networks; however, they may be unfamiliar with the controls needed to secure next-generation networks.

It is almost impossible to achieve high fault coverages without using design for testability (DFT) approaches. In one of the most promising DFT approaches, the complex VLSI circuit is divided into various structural modules, and an appropriate built-in self-test (BIST) scheme for each module is then implemented. This approach also provides a path to board- and system-level test. This paper presents a general procedure to implement BIST for a specific set of modules, i.e., embedded regular structures such as static random-access memory (SRAM), read-only memory (ROM), and register files. We will show that fault coverages achieved with this procedure are greater than 99 percent, because the deterministic BIST algorithms and output-data compaction techniques adopted are structure-specific. Moreover, fault simulations are not needed because the fault coverages are analytically determined by an algorithmic approach. The general procedure presented here results in an automated BIST implementation. An illustration of such a procedure is presented through the BIST register file example.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1990.tb00338.x","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6770222/06770229.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1990.tb00338.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770222","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated BIST for regular structures embedded in ASIC devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770229/","displayDocTitle":"Automated BIST for regular structures embedded in ASIC devices","volume":"69","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated BIST for regular structures embedded in ASIC devices","sourcePdf":"bstj69397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048904S","chronDate":"May-June  1990","isNumber":"6770222","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"10","articleId":"6770229","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6770233,"authors":[{"name":"Robert W.

Polarization-division-multiplexed (PDM) quaternary-phase-shift-keying (QPSK) paired with coherent detection has been found to be promising for upgrading optical legacy systems based on 50 GHz wavelength slots thanks to its high spectral efficiency (2 bit/s/Hz) and its tolerance to linear effects. One of the major concerns for the deployment of such a solution is the transmission reach, mainly limited by nonlinear effects. This limitation can be exacerbated over non-zero dispersion shifted fiber (NZDSF) due to low local chromatic dispersion of the transmission fiber. The aim of this paper is first to report on the benefits brought by combining coherent detection techniques with advanced modulation formats as compared to conventional direct detection schemes for optical fiber communications. Digital signal processing paired with coherent detection is described to point out the efficiency of a coherent receiver to combat noise and to mitigate linear impairments. We then report on nonlinear tolerance of 100 Gb/s coherent PDM-QPSK through an 8 Tb/s transmission over a dispersion-managed link based on low dispersion fibers.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20402","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6770231/06770235.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770231","startPage":"27","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"8 Tb/s long haul transmission over low dispersion fibers using 100 Gb/s PDM-QPSK channels paired with coherent detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"8 Tb/s long haul transmission over low dispersion fibers using 100 Gb/s PDM-QPSK channels paired with coherent detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Winter  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Winter  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Winter 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"8 Tb/s long haul transmission over low dispersion fibers using 100 Gb/s PDM-QPSK channels paired with coherent detection","sourcePdf":"6770235.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015441S","chronDate":"Winter  2010","isNumber":"6770231","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6770235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6770236,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Liu","affiliation":["Transmission Systems and Networking Department at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Fred Buchali","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs Optical Transmission Group in Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Buchali"},{"name":"Robert W.

We present promising techniques to mitigate the fiber nonlinear impairments in both single-channel and wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) transmission. For single-channel transmission, we discuss a joint self-phase modulation (SPM) compensation scheme that is applicable to polarization division multiplexed (PDM) CO-OFDM signals.

For WDM transmission, we describe an OFDM frame design and a dispersion management scheme that reduce the cross-phase-modulation (XPM) penalty among the WDM channels.

The basis for this study is the simple three-ray multipath fade, which provides a channel transfer function of the form H(\u03c9) = a[1 \u2212 b exp \u2212j(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\n)\u03c4], where a is the scale parameter, b is a shape parameter, \u03c4 is the delay difference in the channel, and \u03c9\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\n is the (radian) frequency of the fade minimum. This model is indistinguishable from an ideal channel model, within the accuracy of existing measurements. The propagation data that confirm the model were obtained in summer 1977 from a 26.4-mile hop near Atlanta, Georgia. The received power at 24 sample frequencies spaced at 1.1 MHz and centered on 6034.2 MHz was continuously monitored and recorded during periods of anomalous behavior. The model is applied to estimating the statistics of the channel delay difference, \u03c4. The average delay difference giving rise to significant selectivity in the channel is between 5 and 9 ns. The distribution of delay difference is obtained for delay differences greater than 10 ns. The channel is found to have more than 3 dB of selectivity (difference between maximum and minimum attenuation in band) due to delay differences greater than 20 ns for more than 70 seconds in a heavy fading month. (This is comparable to the time the channel attenuation of a single frequency exceeds 40 dB.) The three-path model requires further simplification for narrowband channel application. For a channel with 30 MHz bandwidth, a model with fixed delay of 6.3 ns provides a sufficiently accurate representation of all observed channel conditions. The resulting nonphysical model is used to statistically characterize the condition of the fading channel. The statistics of the parameters of the fixed delay model are almost independent and of relatively simple form. The distribution of the shape parameter b is of the form (1 \u2212 b)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2.3</sup>\n.

The transport requirements for periodic measurement data are characterized as continual, reliable, and secure delivery of small-sized packets (less than 1.5 KB) over a utility-owned wide area network (WAN). Motivated by our assessment that no well-known transport protocol adequately meets these requirements, we designed the Smart Grid Transport Protocol (SGTP) for smart grid networking.

The insertion loss with failure of either the power supply or the low-noise transistor is typically 5 to 8 dB. The amplifier uses a single gallium arsenide field effect transistor in conjunction with a passive failsafe by-pass network utilizing circulators. This approach permits the noise figure and the gain flatness to be optimized for each amplifier without compromising the input and output matches. It is concluded that this single-transistor amplifier design has significant advantages both in performance and in simplicity over the balanced amplifier design.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1978.tb00594.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6770320/06770321.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"490","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1978.tb00594.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-noise gallium arsenide field effect transistor amplifier for 4 GHz Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1978","displayDocTitle":"A low-noise gallium arsenide field effect transistor amplifier for 4 GHz Radio","volume":"57","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1978","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-noise gallium arsenide field effect transistor amplifier for 4 GHz Radio","sourcePdf":"bstj573479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020516S","chronDate":"March  1978","isNumber":"6770320","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6770321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6770344,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Spiess","firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Spiess"},{"name":"Yves T'Joens","firstName":"Yves","lastName":"T'Joens"},{"name":"Raluca Dragnea","firstName":"Raluca","lastName":"Dragnea"},{"name":"Peter Spencer","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Spencer"},{"name":"Laurent Philippart","firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Philippart"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6770344","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3816},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770344","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big data","Data analysis","Telecommunication network management","Service providers","Telecommunication services","Behavioral science","Consumer behavior","Customer relationship management","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","customer satisfaction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","business performance","communication service providers","CSP","customer experience","customer satisfaction","Alcatel-Lucent","Bell Labs","quality indicators","business objective formula","customer behavior prediction","net promoter score","NPS"]}],"abstract":"In an environment where communications service providers (CSPs) increasingly have the same service offers and devices, offering a superior customer experience is a priority to compete.

Video is acquired by compressive measurements, and the measurements are used to analyze the video by a low rank and sparse decomposition of a matrix. The low rank component represents the background, and the sparse component, which is obtained in a tight wavelet frame domain, is used to identify moving objects in the surveillance video. An important feature of the proposed low latency method is that the decomposition can be performed with a small number of video frames, which reduces latency in the reconstruction and makes it possible for real time processing of surveillance video.

In this case study, we exploit rich, multi-year, and high-frequency annotated data collected via a metering infrastructure to perform STLF on aggregates of power meters in a mid-sized city. For smart meter aggregates complemented with geo-specific weather data, we benchmark several state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms, including kernel methods for nonlinear regression, seasonal and temperature-adjusted auto-regressive models, exponential smoothing and state-space models. We show how STLF accuracy improves at larger meter aggregation (at feeder, substation, and system-wide level).

The paper focuses on the MIMO link, especially on polarization diversity using cross-polarized antennas. A vectorial signal model for polarization diversity communication is then defined including the coupling effects. MIMO antenna candidates are analyzed. Following this new approach, a broadband dual-polarized base station antenna network for WiMAX coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (COFDM) waveforms was optimized, realized, and measured for MIMO communications.

For a zero-bias capacitance of 200 pF, a typical value for such devices made by oxide-masking techniques, the measured rise time of an led that is fully turned on and the turn-on delay time of injection lasers may be as much as twice the limitation imposed by the spontaneous carrier recombination time. A proposed method to reduce these delays by preshaping the driving pulse is analyzed, and a reduction of the delay by a factor of 2 or better is predicted. These results are in agreement with experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770452/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1975","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 1975","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effect of junction capacitance on the rise time of led's and on the turn-on delay of injection lasers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of junction capacitance on the rise time of led's and on the turn-on delay of injection lasers","sourcePdf":"bstj54153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019918S","chronDate":"Jan.  1975","isNumber":"6770447","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"30","articleId":"6770452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6770456,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Any knowledge of the channel or the signaling format can be taken into account and will speed up the convergence process. The main applications are seen in partial-response signaling, where the new algorithm eliminates the interaction between the individual tap increments. This is achieved by decorrelating the components of the gradient in a fixed weighting matrix prior to the adjustments. Convergence is then extremely fast. If the channel has only phase distortion, a single iteration is sufficient to obtain the optimum tap vector (for any timing and carrier phase). This is verified by computer simulations. Finally, the new equalizer is compared with another structure recently proposed, and some advantages of the new system with regard to implementation and flexibility are pointed out.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new, fast-converging mean-square algorithm for adaptive equalizers with partial-response signaling","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1975.tb02829.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6770447/06770456.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1975.tb02829.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770456","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1975","displayDocTitle":"A new, fast-converging mean-square algorithm for adaptive equalizers with partial-response signaling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new, fast-converging mean-square algorithm for adaptive equalizers with partial-response signaling","sourcePdf":"bstj541143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022262S","chronDate":"Jan.  1975","isNumber":"6770447","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"17","articleId":"6770456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6770460,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A natural question is, How will the performance of such a system depend on the timing phase \u03c4, 0 \u2266 \u03c4 \u2266 T? We examine this problem in considerable detail for an infinite equalizer using a mean-square measure of performance. Excess bandwidth results in a significant difference in performance between the best and worst timing phase. Under practical noise conditions, it is estimated that the excess bandwidth must be down to 1 or 2 percent before the timing effect becomes insignificant. With a 10-percent roll-off, a 3-dB penalty can be incurred by choosing a bad timing epoch. Our main result is that under conditions likely to be encountered on channels similar to voiceband telephone channels, the optimum sampling instants will be accurately approximated by the consecutive maxima and minima of the sine wave that result when an alternating sequence of positive and negative pulses (dotting sequence) is transmitted. There are no additional local minima of the minimum mean-square error as the timing phase is varied.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum timing phase for an infinite equalizer","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1975.tb02833.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6770447/06770460.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1975.tb02833.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770460","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770460/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1975","displayDocTitle":"Optimum timing phase for an infinite equalizer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum timing phase for an infinite equalizer","sourcePdf":"bstj541189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042373S","chronDate":"Jan.  1975","isNumber":"6770447","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"13","articleId":"6770460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6770468,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Clos","firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Clos"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0005-8580"}],"articleNumber":"6770468","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":694,"citationCountPatent":29,"totalDownloads":2079},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770468","abstract":"This paper describes a method of designing arrays of crosspoints for use in telephone switching systems in which it will always be possible to establish a connection from an idle inlet to an idle outlet regardless of the number of calls served by the system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770463","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6770463/06770468.pdf","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1953.tb01433.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1953.tb01433.x","startPage":"406","endPage":"424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of non-blocking switching networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1953","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1953","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770468/","displayDocTitle":"A study of non-blocking switching networks","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"March 1953","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of non-blocking switching networks","sourcePdf":"bstj322406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0184S","chronDate":"March  1953","isNumber":"6770463","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"694","articleId":"6770468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6770473,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Formulas are derived for the bit error rate in homodyne and heterodyne Phase Shift Keying (PSK), Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK), Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) and on-off keying. Estimates are provided of the penalties accrued due to phase noise. Based on detailed mathematical analysis and estimates, we made several findings. Near quantum-limited receiver sensitivity can be achieved with PSK using homodyne detection only at signaling rates 3000 times greater than the laser linewidth. A receiver sensitivity 3 to 6 decibels poorer than the quantum limit can be achieved with heterodyne rather than homodyne detection. DPSK, for example, can operate at rates only 300 times greater than the laser linewidth. At lower rates, FSK is an attractive candidate. It can be designed to be extremely tolerant of phase noise by using wide frequency deviations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770472","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6770472/06770473.pdf","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1985.tb00001.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1985.tb00001.x","startPage":"2153","endPage":"2209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coherent lightwave communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770473/","displayDocTitle":"Coherent lightwave communications","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent lightwave communications","sourcePdf":"bstj64102153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062485S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"6770472","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"28","articleId":"6770473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6770481,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To evaluate this performance for digital systems with high-order modulation schemes, a statistical model for frequency-selective fading is needed. New propagation data obtained in Gainesville, Florida, were used to generalize Rummler's model to include group delay response. The introduction of the delay response data into the model of the fading channel enabled the classification of the fades as minimum phase and nonminimum phase. We found that 24 percent of all fades have significant delay distortion, and can be characterized as being minimum phase or non-minimum phase. In the range of practical interest, there are as many minimum phase as nonminimum phase fades. The results of this work will facilitate a better understanding of the fading channel, which will be beneficial in the engineering of radio routes and digital radio design. The results also demonstrate the need for a description of the geographical occurrence of dispersion, which will differ from that for multipath fading at a single frequency. This is based on the observation, presented in this paper, that the relative amount of dispersive fading is significantly greater in Gainesville, Florida, than in Palmetto, Georgia. The availability of a dispersive fading map will facilitate the accurate engineering of digital radio routes.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1985.tb00016.x","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6770472/06770488.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1985.tb00016.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770472","startPage":"2525","endPage":"2550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical model for amplitude and delay of selective fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Statistical model for amplitude and delay of selective fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical model for amplitude and delay of selective fading","sourcePdf":"bstj64102525.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060923S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"6770472","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6770488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6770505,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Among the highlights of this issue are six topics not even mentioned in the forecasts of 1987: cable television (CATV) transmission, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, quantum-well lasers, photonic integrated circuits, soliton propagation in fibers, and free-space digital optics. Although this issue cannot hope to tell the complete story of lightwave technology and photonics, the topics selected illustrate the pace of their progress.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1992","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"71","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lightwave technology: An update","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightwave technology: An update","sourcePdf":"bstj7112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077881S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1992","isNumber":"6770561","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","articleId":"6770562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6770563,"authors":[{"name":"Peter K.

In 1991, the technological progress continued as we began to install the higher capacity systems (i.e., 560 Mb/s) that use advances in laser and fiber technology. On the drawing board are systems targeted for service in 1995 that are based on revolutionary optical-amplifier technology with 5,000-Mb/s capacity.

Most delivered traditional telephony (i.e., narrowband) services to the home, but a few provided both narrowband and entertainment video (i.e., broadband) services. During that time, the local-exchange carriers (LECs) also formulated their objectives and strategies for deploying FITL. As they gained a better understanding of the marketplace and the political realities of delivering video services, the LECs adopted an FITL-deployment strategy based on strict cost-effectiveness for the delivery of traditional telephone services. However, any fiber-optic access architecture they adopt has to support broadband services in the future. To address the cost and service challenges of FITL, the LECs and vendors must continually evaluate many alternative access architectures to identify potential advantages that can help fiber access achieve cost parity with copper access. Total system costs must be considered including electrical and optical components, powering system, fiber and cable components, and life-cycle costs (i.e., administration, maintenance, assignment, and provisioning operations).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770566/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1992","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1992","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"71","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fiber in the loop","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber in the loop","sourcePdf":"bstj71131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032766S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1992","isNumber":"6770561","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","articleId":"6770566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6770567,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

EDFAs are inherently fiber compatible, insensitive to polarization effects, and immune to crosstalk among wavelength-multiplexed channels. These remarkable attributes, and the ease with which they can be realized, have propelled EDFAs from their discovery in the research laboratory to commercial availability in less than three years. EDFAs may be used as power amplifiers to boost transmitter power, optical repeaters to amplify weak signals, and optical preamplifiers to increase receiver sensitivity. The success of EDFA system experiments and the decision to use EDFAs as repeaters in the next generation of transoceanic submarine lightwave systems demonstrate the practical benefits of EDFAs and their potential in future lightwave systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1992","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1992","volume":"71","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers and the next generation of lightwave systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers and the next generation of lightwave systems","sourcePdf":"bstj71153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033037S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1992","isNumber":"6770561","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"13","articleId":"6770568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6770593,"authors":[{"name":"H.

An analysis of two phase-control algorithms for space diversity combining, comparing the performance capabilities of a maximum-power and an amplitude-equalizing algorithm, is presented in this paper. The extended capabilities of the equalizing algorithm in mitigating linear and quadratic channel distortions are investigated through computer simulations. A reduction in digital radio outage time afforded by the equalizing algorithm (relative to that of the maximum-power algorithm) is approximated for over-water-paths where it is assumed that fading can be described in terms of a two-ray fading model.

The calculations are based on the measured AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics, and include results of a computer simulation, and analytical results based on modeling the SSPA as an ideal envelope limiter. The results demonstrate that the calculations predict wideband performance characteristics of nonlinear amplifiers for arbitrary input signal configurations and operating conditions, as well as provide a basis for comparison against which anomalous behavior can be identified. Earlier results, in which anomalous behavior of an SSPA was observed to result in significant performance degradation, are discussed in the light of these new results. A simple analytical criterion is developed for evaluating measurements to identify such degradation. The effect of AM/PM conversion is investigated and found to cause significant degradation in IM performance only at low power levels for typical SSPAs. In the vicinity of saturation, and above, the contribution to IM noise due to AM/PM conversion is found to be very small in comparison with that due to the saturating AM/AM characteristic.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1984.tb00092.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1984.tb00092.x","startPage":"231","endPage":"248","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731004/6770666/06770669.pdf","publicationTitle":"AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband operation of nonlinear solid-state power amplifiers \u2014 Comparisons of calculations and measurements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1984","displayDocTitle":"Wideband operation of nonlinear solid-state power amplifiers \u2014 Comparisons of calculations and measurements","publicationDate":"Feb. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"63","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770669/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband operation of nonlinear solid-state power amplifiers \u2014 Comparisons of calculations and measurements","sourcePdf":"bstj632231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044382S","chronDate":"Feb.  1984","isNumber":"6770666","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731004","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6770669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6770671,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This information is needed for refining the configuration and design of portable radiotelephone systems that will accommodate low-power portable sets. Signal levels have been measured in and around three small buildings and a house, using an instrumentation van with an erectable 27-foot-high antenna. These buildings and the house all have metallic materials in their walls and thus are expected to exhibit high attenuation. The van was parked at one location with respect to the three buildings, and at nine different locations, at distances ranging from 400 feet to 1600 feet, from the house. We found that small-scale signal envelope variations are approximately Rayleigh distributed. For the house, large-scale distributions of the small-scale signal medians are approximately log-normal.

Special cases include conventional DPCM and Pulse Code Modulation (PCM). Our main result is a signal-to-noise ratio formula in which the effects of source characteristics (input signal, codec design parameters) and the effects of transmission characteristics (modulation, channel, forward error correction) are clearly distinguishable. We also present, in computationally convenient forms, specialized formulas that apply to uncoded transmission through a random-error channel, transmission through a slowly fading channel, and transmission with part or all of the DPCM signal protected by an error-correcting code. Numerical results show how channel coding can have different effects on conventional and embedded DPCM.

Each bit in the \u03bc-law PCM word is assigned its own soft decision demodulation erasure threshold. These thresholds are theoretically determined as a function of the input power level, channel s/n, and the relative mean square error power \u03b4 that occurs because of the replacement by interpolation or prediction of those samples discarded in the soft decision demodulation process. We find that there is no advantage in applying soft demodulation to more than the first 4 bits of the 8-bit \u03bc-law PCM words, \u03bc = 255. When the input signal level was \u221217 dB (corresponding to peak overall speech s/n in the absence of transmission errors), the gains in overall speech s/n compared to basic \u03bc-law PCM and fixed weighted \u03bc-law PCM were 7 and 3.5 dB, respectively, when the channel s/n was 30 dB. More significantly, when the input signal level was reduced to \u221240 dB, the corresponding gains in overall speech s/n were 18 and 12 dB. Simulations were performed using four concatenated speech sentences and a fading channel that was obtained from a mobile radio Rayleigh fading hardware simulator.

We jointly optimize transmitter and receiver matrix filters when the inputs are two independent quadrature-amplitude-modulated data signals of fixed total average power. Formulas for minimum total mean-square error, upper bounds on probability of error, matched filter bounds, and the Shannon limit are provided. Using this theory in conjunction with a proposed propagation model for the dually polarized radio channel, we provide estimates of probability distributions of the data rates that can be supported by the optimum receiver structures as well as the jointly optimized transmitter-receiver. The distribution of data rates predicted from the Shannon limit as well as from the matched filter bounds are also given. For the dually polarized radio channel, we find that linear equalization structures can practically eliminate the effects of cross-polarization interference contributed by the antennas and their feeds. At very low outage probabilities, the combined-channels data rate achieved with the jointly optimized structures is about 4 b/s/Hz less than predicted from their matched filter bounds. Also, the combined data rate associated with the Shannon limit is about 3 b/s/Hz higher than predicted by the matched filter bound at very low outage probabilities. Sensitivity analyses reveal that about 1 b/s/Hz can be gained for each 3-dB increase in carrier-to-noise ratio. For each order-of-magnitude decrease in the required error rate, about 0.3 b/s/Hz is given up.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1984","publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"63","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Linear equalization theory in digital data transmission over dually polarized fading radio channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear equalization theory in digital data transmission over dually polarized fading radio channels","sourcePdf":"bstj63102215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021051S","chronDate":"Dec.  1984","isNumber":"6770742","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731004","citationCount":"41","articleId":"6770747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6770768,"authors":[{"name":"B.-H.

Many properties of cyclic codes are special cases of properties of ideals in an Abelian group algebra. A character of an Abelian group G of order v is, for our purposes, a homomorphism of G into the group of vth roots of unity over GF(2). If G is cyclic with generator x, the character is entirely determined by what it does to x; this effect is kept, and the characters are discarded. If G is not cyclic it is necessary to rehabilitate the characters. Without them the notation is impossible; with them one can prove a number of theorems which reduce in the special case to well-known properties of cyclic codes. Moreover the writer thinks that the general proof is often easier and more suggestive than the proof for the special case. To support this point of view we produce a new theorem, which of course also applies to cyclic codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6770801/06770805.pdf","startPage":"987","endPage":"1011","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01812.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01812.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770801","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary codes which are ideals in the group algebra of an abelian group","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1970","displayDocTitle":"Binary codes which are ideals in the group algebra of an abelian group","volume":"49","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary codes which are ideals in the group algebra of an abelian group","sourcePdf":"bstj496987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03212S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1970","isNumber":"6770801","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"21","articleId":"6770805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6770821,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is shown that, as a consequence of any such bias, the canceler tap weights can randomly drift; however, in contrast to voice-type cancelers and fractionally spaced equalizers, the data-driven canceler will not drift into instability. Nevertheless, the canceler's performance can be severely degraded, even for very small amounts of bias. The main result of this paper is a quantitative study of the canceler's performance as a function of the biases and the canceler's various design parameters, such as the number of tap coefficients and the step size used in the tap adjustment algorithm. Although the study concentrates on the biases introduced by two's-complement arithmetic, the results are general enough to be used with any type of arithmetic, provided that the biases introduced by these different types of arithmetic are known. Some of the analytical results have been verified experimentally, in real time, on a digital signal processor constructed at AT&T Bell Laboratories and AT&T Information Systems. Specifically, it is shown how the bias introduced by rounding the product of commercially available two's-complement multipliers can be eliminated by a proper choice of the values of the canceler's input symbols.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1985.tb00423.x","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6770819/06770826.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"138","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1985.tb00423.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of biases on digitally implemented data-driven echo cancelers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Effects of biases on digitally implemented data-driven echo cancelers","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of biases on digitally implemented data-driven echo cancelers","sourcePdf":"bstj641115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039046S","chronDate":"Jan.  1985","isNumber":"6770819","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6770826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6770887,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, we give a method of optimizing the characteristics of this digital filter under two different criteria. The first criterion is the well-known signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, whereas the second criterion is the weighted sum of the signal power, the quantization noise power, and the noise power within a given band of frequencies. We design optimum digital filters and simulate their performance on the computer. We show that the theoretically predicted S/N ratio is in good agreement with the performance obtained by computer simulation. It is seen that about 23 dB improvement in S/N ratio over the S/N ratio attainable by a constant-weight digital filter is possible when the number of coarse quantizations is 256. We also study the effects of changing various parameters of the A/D converter on the S/N ratio.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1977.tb00584.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6770882/06770887.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1977.tb00584.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770882","startPage":"1629","endPage":"1641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum digital filters for interpolative A/D converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Optimum digital filters for interpolative A/D converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1977","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 1977","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum digital filters for interpolative A/D converters","sourcePdf":"bstj5691629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01943S","chronDate":"Nov.  1977","isNumber":"6770882","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6770887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6770894,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

Permutation decoding makes use of these symmetries to build up a decoding algorithm for the code. It is difficult to find an appropriate set of symmetries for a code picked at random. For cyclic codes the problem is somewhat easier, and for some special cyclic codes it is solved completely in this paper. For these codes, at least, it is evident that permutation decoding is easy to implement and inexpensive compared with other decoding schemes. Permutation decoding as a n eans of error control is evaluated for the binary symmetric channel and for the switched telephone network as represented by experimental data. It is found to be extremely effective on the binary symmetric channel and of very doubtful value on the present telephone network.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1964.tb04075.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6770897/06770917.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1964.tb04075.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770897","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","startPage":"485","endPage":"505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Permutation decoding of systematic codes","volume":"43","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1964","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permutation decoding of systematic codes","sourcePdf":"bstj431485.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122495S","chronDate":"Jan.  1964","isNumber":"6770897","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"38","articleId":"6770917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6770931,"authors":[{"name":"Richard P.

Lucent Technologies has taken the lead in addressing this limitation. Lucent's phase 1 solution offers the highest possible performance while conforming to current IS-95-A air interface design characteristics and thereby maintaining strict compatibility with existing base station hardware. The proposed standard will support a high data rate (64 kb/s) both to and from the mobile device. This paper describes the architecture, design, and performance of the Burst Admission based on Load and Interference (BALI) high-speed data solution for CDMA. High-speed service is provided through the aggregation of multiple codes. A new burst-mode capability is defined to allow better interference management and capacity utilization. In the burst mode, the number of codes that may be used by a mobile on the forward or reverse link for the duration of a burst is controlled by the infrastructure. Static allocation of multiple codes to a small number of users can result in inefficient use of CDMA air interface capacity. Dynamic infrastructure-controlled burst allocation makes it possible to share the bandwidth efficiently among several high-speed packet data mobiles.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.2070","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6770921/06770931.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.2070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6770921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BALI: A solution for high-speed CDMA data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6770931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770931/","displayDocTitle":"BALI: A solution for high-speed CDMA data","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Summer 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BALI: A solution for high-speed CDMA data","sourcePdf":"2070ftp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024229S","chronDate":"Summer  1997","isNumber":"6770921","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"12","articleId":"6770931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6770944,"authors":[{"name":"B.-H.

Considering both the conventional synchronously spaced equalizer and the newer fractionally spaced equalizer, insight is provided into the relationship between the tap-weight precision and the steady-state, mean-squared error. It is demonstrated why the number of adaptive tap weights should be kept to a minimum (consistent with acceptable steady-state performance), both from convergence and precision requirements. A simple formula is given that displays the tradeoff among the equalizer mean-squared error, the number of taps, the channel characteristics, and digital resolution. For typical basic-conditioned voiceband channels operating at 9.6 kb/s, and neglecting the effects that limited resolution might have on timing and carrier phase tracking, analysis and simulation both indicate that the required top-weight resolution is of the order of 11 or 12 bits. Moreover, the minimum precision is only weakly dependent on the quality of the channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6770974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1979","volume":"58","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1979","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the required tap-weight precision for digitally implemented, adaptive, mean-squared equalizers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the required tap-weight precision for digitally implemented, adaptive, mean-squared equalizers","sourcePdf":"bstj582301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027111S","chronDate":"Feb.  1979","isNumber":"6770972","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"47","articleId":"6770974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6770982,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Instead, people develop them because they have new ways of thinking about the process of programming and have new types of problems to solve. When we generalize and codify these thought processes, they achieve the status of paradigms, and new languages are created to support those paradigms. The language enables programmers to use the paradigm's power to deliver software of improved quality and lower life-cycle cost. This paper shows how AT&T's C++ language supports several modern programming paradigms to improve software quality and boost productivity. The language is more expressive than C, leads to more maintainable programs, and employs constructs that encourage software reuse and software architecture techniques that deal with complexity in large systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-August  1988","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-August  1988","publicationDate":"July-August 1988","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"67","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"C++: Evolving toward a more powerful language","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"C++: Evolving toward a more powerful language","sourcePdf":"bstj67419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040447S","chronDate":"July-August  1988","isNumber":"6771036","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6771039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6771051,"authors":[{"name":"E.

analysis of split base station processing and determination of advantageous architectures for LTE","abstract":"Centralization of the baseband processing in radio access networks may reduce radio site operations costs, reduce capital costs, and ease implementation of multi-site coordination mechanisms such as coordinated multipoint transmission and reception (CoMP). However, the initial architecture proposals for a centralized Long Term Evolution (LTE) deployment using transport of radio samples require a high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnection network. This may be uneconomical, or it may only be cost effective for a limited number of sites. To mitigate that deficiency without sacrificing the benefits of centralized processing, we identified alternative interfacing options between central and remote units. To do so we analyzed possible splits of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) baseband processing chain for their bandwidth and latency requirements. Next, we analyzed the operational impacts of potential splits based on a number of criteria including ease of CoMP introduction, the possibility of realizing pooling gains, and the ability to update the system and introduce new features. Based on our results, we propose architectures that can leverage the benefits of centralization at a much-reduced cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771075/","volume":"18","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"14870100","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative analysis of split base station processing and determination of advantageous architectures for LTE","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative analysis of split base station processing and determination of advantageous architectures for LTE","sourcePdf":"6771075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038844S","chronDate":"June  2013","isNumber":"6771066","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"87","articleId":"6771075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6771076,"authors":[{"name":"Bernd Haberland","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Haberland"},{"name":"Fariborz Derakhshan","affiliation":["Network Technologies Research domain at Bell Labs in Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Fariborz","lastName":"Derakhshan"},{"name":"Heidrun Grob-Lipski","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Heidrun","lastName":"Grob-Lipski"},{"name":"Ralf Klotsche","affiliation":["Bell Labs in Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Klotsche"},{"name":"Werner Rehm","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Rehm"},{"name":"Peter Schefczik","affiliation":["Bell Labs in Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Schefczik"},{"name":"Michael Soellner","affiliation":["Bell Labs in Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Soellner"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6771076","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":19,"totalDownloads":1161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6771076","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Base stations","Baseband","Radio access networks","Mobile communication","Microprocessors","Protocols","Cellular networks","3G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cloud computing","radio access networks","resource allocation","telecommunication computing","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtualized radio access network","load balancing","elastic allocation","dynamic allocation","virtualization techniques","cloud base station","heterogeneous cellular architectures","femtocell configurations","picocell configurations","radio path","user traffic","IP traffic growth","Internet Protocol","LTE","long term evolution","3GPP","3rd Generation Partnership Project","cellular radio networks","radio base stations"]}],"doi":"10.1002/bltj.21596","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6771066/06771076.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio base stations in the cloud","abstract":"During the past few years, architectures for cellular radio networks like 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) have evolved towards flatter topologies with fewer centralized nodes, shifting more and more radio-related processing towards the base station or even further into so-called remote radio heads near the antennas. With Internet Protocol (IP) traffic growth, user traffic lost its predictability, which resulted in the need for the over-dimensioning of processing and forwarding resources in the radio path. This is especially true in upcoming picocell and femtocell configurations in heterogeneous cellular architectures. To hold down costs resulting from these emerging architectures and deployments, we developed a concept of a cloud base station. Developed as a candidate for a lightRadio\u2122 evolution, this cloud base station leverages virtualization techniques such as dynamic and elastic allocation of baseband processing resources between small and large cell sites, as well as load balancing between temporarily overloaded sites and their less utilized neighbors. A cloud base station in a virtualized radio access network (RAN) can serve to ease a smooth standards migration towards LTE-Advanced with the same deployed equipment, and in the future, support the transformation of dedicated baseband hardware into general purpose processing platforms. In this paper, we discuss the tight networking requirements of a cloud base station in a virtual radio access network, architecture challenges, and our cloud management solutions. We also demonstrate research results on the concept, provide validation based on simulations, and discuss business case related implications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14881196","volume":"18","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Radio base stations in the cloud","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio base stations in the cloud","sourcePdf":"6771076.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022746S","chronDate":"June  2013","isNumber":"6771066","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"35","articleId":"6771076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6771077,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Timmers","affiliation":["Bell Labs' Access Research Domain in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Timmers"},{"name":"Dirk Vanderhaegen","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent's Wireline Fixed Access group in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Vanderhaegen"},{"name":"Danny Van Bruyssel","affiliation":["DSL-PHY expert team within the Alcatel-Lucent Wireline Networks IP DSLAM Product Unit in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Danny","lastName":"Van Bruyssel"},{"name":"Mamoun Guenach","affiliation":["Bell Labs' Access Research Domain in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Mamoun","lastName":"Guenach"},{"name":"Jochen Maes","affiliation":["Bell Labs' Access Research Domain in Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Maes"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6771077","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DSL","Broadband communication","Optical fiber networks","Modulation","Transmitters","Telecommunication traffic","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","digital subscriber lines","quality of service","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital subscriber line","DSL technology","hierarchical modulation","time-varying channels","all-fiber network","wireline access network operators","broadband traffic","transmitter-controlled adaptive modulation"]}],"abstract":"The continued growth of broadband traffic pushes wireline access network operators to continuously offer better service. Due to the large investments needed to upgrade to an all-fiber network, operators seek to boost performance over their existing copper-based infrastructure, while gradually evolving to a fiber network. As a result, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technology, which offers broadband over copper, has been drastically improving. The next generation of DSL will enable the continued cost-effective deployment of fiber in the access network by providing aggregate data rates up to 1 Gb/s. To keep operational costs down, this new DSL generation should enable self-installation. Therefore, it should be robust and adaptive to a wide range of time-varying channels. In this paper, we propose a novel technique based on hierarchical modulation to achieve this robustness. It adapts quickly to noise and interference dynamics in frequency and in time and allows the transmitter to select its preferred configuration without the need for an explicit communication of this configuration to the receiver. We present an overview of hierarchical modulation and how we aim to use these concepts in DSL. We further show with simulations that the receiver is able to blindly track the changes introduced by the transmitter and discuss how this protocol can be easily introduced in state-of-the-art systems.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.21597","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6771066/06771077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771066","startPage":"153","endPage":"169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitter-controlled adaptive modulation: Concepts and results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6771077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter-controlled adaptive modulation: Concepts and results","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"14881197","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter-controlled adaptive modulation: Concepts and results","sourcePdf":"6771077.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044982S","chronDate":"June  2013","isNumber":"6771066","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6771077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6771085,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We present three classes of weighting functions which may be used to improve the inherent accuracy of such a system. The form of the weighting functions was chosen to minimize the amount of computer memory required, without using too much computer time. Several formulas are derived for estimating the frequency and level of a tone from its DFT coefficients. We chose the formulas to minimize computation time. Simulation results indicate that, through the use of a proper weighting function, a DFT measurement system that uses 512 samples taken at a sampling frequency of 7040 Hz can be designed so that the maximum error in the frequency estimates of two tones near 1000 Hz and separated by approximately 50 Hz is about 0.03 Hz. The corresponding maximum error in the level estimate is on the order of 0.03 dB.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01766.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6771081/06771085.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01766.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of the discrete fourier transform in the measurement of frequencies and levels of tones","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1970","displayDocTitle":"Use of the discrete fourier transform in the measurement of frequencies and levels of tones","volume":"49","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of the discrete fourier transform in the measurement of frequencies and levels of tones","sourcePdf":"bstj492197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025696S","chronDate":"Feb.  1970","isNumber":"6771081","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"161","articleId":"6771085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6771089,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Businesses of all sizes and from all sectors are choosing to outsource large portions of their information technology (IT) operations to Internet-based data centers that host application service providers (ASPs). Many network service providers (NSPs) have decided to become CyberCarrier service providers (CCSPs) \u2014 that is, they have decided to expand their businesses to include ASP data center hosting services. Managing these new ASP data center hosting services is one of the most urgent challenges encountered by a CCSP, and its solution is arguably critical to a CCSP's long-term success. Although introducing ASP data center hosting services increases and diversifies a CCSP's revenue, it also significantly complicates the CCSP's management processes. This paper defines an abstract management functional architecture that divides the CCSP management problem into tractable pieces and addresses each of them. Then it explains how the CyberCarrier Solution maps onto that functional architecture. Finally, it explores how Lucent will evolve its CyberCarrier Solution through future management system innovations.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.2250","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6771296/06771300.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.2250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CyberCarrier service and network management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.-Dec.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2000","displayDocTitle":"CyberCarrier service and network management","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CyberCarrier service and network management","sourcePdf":"2250ftp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035935S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2000","isNumber":"6771296","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","articleId":"6771300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6771306,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent K.

The system uses noncoherent Mary orthogonal modulation with a RAKE receiver and power control. We considered both a fast fading channel and a combined fast fading, shadowing, and power control channel. To evaluate the performance of the system, we derived analytical bounds and conducted simulations. We found significant improvements in the average throughput and the bit error rate (BER) performance using the adaptive coding scheme. The amount of improvement drops as the number of diversity branches increases. More importantly, we found that the adaptive coding scheme is relatively robust to shadowing, while fixed-rate codes are ineffective in the shadowing environment. The adaptive coding scheme is also robust to mobile speed, feedback delay, and finite interleaving depth.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.2256","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6771296/06771306.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.2256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable-rate adaptive channel coding for CDMA \u2014 Reverse link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6771306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.-Dec.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771306/","displayDocTitle":"Variable-rate adaptive channel coding for CDMA \u2014 Reverse link","volume":"5","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-rate adaptive channel coding for CDMA \u2014 Reverse link","sourcePdf":"2256ftp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053119S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2000","isNumber":"6771296","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6771306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6771348,"authors":[{"name":"Vassilka Kirova","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs' Software Models and Infrastructure Research Department in Murray Hill, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Vassilka","lastName":"Kirova"},{"name":"Neil Kirby","affiliation":["Bell Labs' Software Models and Infrastructure Research Department in Columbus, Ohio"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Kirby"},{"name":"Darshak Kothari","affiliation":["Software Models and Infrastructure Research Department at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Darshak","lastName":"Kothari"},{"name":"Glenda Childress","affiliation":["Security and CDMA Core Network Systems Engineering and Architecture Department at Alcatel-Lucent and is located in Columbus, Ohio"],"firstName":"Glenda","lastName":"Childress"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6771348","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6771348","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20272","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6771337/06771348.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective requirements traceability: Models, tools, and practices","abstract":"The complexity of telecom systems and their production, coupled with today's globalization of markets, customers, and development teams, have made it critical to define and institutionalize an effective strategy for requirements traceability.

The surface potential is subject to statistical fluctuations arising from various sources. The dominant contribution in the samples measured arises from a random distribution of surface charge. The fluctuating surface potential causes a dispersion of interface state time constants in the depletion region. In the weak inversion region the dispersion is eliminated by interaction between interface states and the minority carrier band. A single time constant results.

Blocks of W dpcm words and one pcm word are transmitted. The receiver compares the decoded dpcm signal at the end of every block with the decoded pcm sample. If the difference is above a threshold, it is assumed that one error exists within the block, and a search is made for the erroneous dpcm code word. Correction is accomplished by inverting the bits in this code word until the difference is below the threshold. Whether or not the error is corrected, the dpcm signal at the end of the block is forced to the value of the pcm sample, thereby preventing error propagation outside the block.

In the absence of transmission errors, there is no perceptible distortion due to the correction system.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1979.tb02242.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1979.tb02242.x","endPage":"728","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6771421/06771429.pdf","startPage":"721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DPCM with forced updating and partial correction of transmission errors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771429/","displayDocTitle":"DPCM with forced updating and partial correction of transmission errors","volume":"58","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"March 1979","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DPCM with forced updating and partial correction of transmission errors","sourcePdf":"bstj583721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034223S","chronDate":"March  1979","isNumber":"6771421","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6771429","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6771437,"authors":[{"name":"James J.

The telecommunications industry is now in the midst of a second wireless revolution, which is projected to have an impact as large as that of the original. The current revolution began with the invention of cellular communications technology. As new discoveries were made and cellular technology advanced, another generation of wireless applications has emerged during the past decade. Recent developments, including AT&T's proposed $12.6 billion merger with McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., whose network now spans nearly one-third of the United States, provide overwhelming proof of the tremendous potential of these technologies. Future applications will make it easier than ever for people to avail themselves of anywhere, anytime voice, data, and messaging services through the telecommunications network. This paper discusses the development of current cellular applications and technologies, and also explores the expanding wireless telecommunications network of the future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771437/","volume":"72","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Wireless systems and technologies: An overview","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless systems and technologies: An overview","sourcePdf":"bstj72411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032676S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6771434","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6771437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6771438,"authors":[{"name":"Talmage P.

Or, do people spend time on networking sites to deepen their existing personal networks and stay connected to old friends or distant family?

Port cards can reserve bus bandwidth for synchronous circuit connections, and can contend for asynchronous bandwidth to send packets. A high-speed optical network interconnects these electronic switches.

The reason for this superior performance is that the fse adoptively realizes the optimum linear receiver; consequently it can effectively compensate for more severe delay distortion than the conventional adaptive equalizer, which suffers from aliasing effects. An additional advantage of the FSE is that data transmission can begin with an arbitrary sampling phase, since the equalizer synthesizes the correct delay during adaptation. We show that an FSE combined with a decision feedback section, which can mitigate the effect of severe amplitude distortion, can compensate for a wide range of linear distortion. At 9.6 kbit/s, the FSE provides a 2 to 3 dB gain in output signal-to-noise ratio, relative to the synchronous equalizer, over worst-case private-line channels. This translates to a theoretical improvement of approximately two orders of magnitude in bit error rate.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1981.tb00240.x","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1981.tb00240.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6771634/06771640.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"296","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractionally-spaced equalization: An improved digital transversal equalizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Fractionally-spaced equalization: An improved digital transversal equalizer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractionally-spaced equalization: An improved digital transversal equalizer","sourcePdf":"bstj602275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041425S","chronDate":"Feb.  1981","isNumber":"6771634","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"166","articleId":"6771640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6771659,"authors":[{"name":"D.

While the advantage of frequency diversity against fading is well known, the system degradation of frame-asynchronous FHMA-PSK due to interference from other users and fading has not been studied, except by modeling the interference as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In this paper, we analyze the performance of two FHMA-PSK systems in a Rayleigh fading environment. We assume that the interferers' addresses are assigned at random and derive expressions for the union upper bound on the bit error rate (P\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</inf>\n) for U users, each assigned N frequencies, i.e., N chips. As an example, we consider transmitting digitized speech (R = 31.25 kb/s) over the mobile radio channel (bandwidth W = 20 MHz), using orthogonal coding of rate r = 5/32 (N = 32). For the differentially coherent FHMA-PSK case, the number of users in a two-way radio system is limited to 26 by the performance of the mobile-to-base link, which corresponds to an equivalent bandwidth of 770 kHz per user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771707/","volume":"59","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-hopping, multiple-access, phase-shift-keying system performance in a Rayleigh fading environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-hopping, multiple-access, phase-shift-keying system performance in a Rayleigh fading environment","sourcePdf":"bstj596861.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019049S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1980","isNumber":"6771704","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6771707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6771733,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Alcatel-Lucent along with partners is proposing several novel techniques beyond the state of the art. Some of the key technologies are orthogonal frequency code division multiple access (OFCDMA), multi-carrier as well as wideband transmission, both frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD) modes, multiple antenna techniques such as space division multiple access (SDMA) and multiple input multiple output (MIMO), interference mitigation techniques, and frequency domain interference cancellation.

The coder is capable of transmitting Picturephone\u00ae signals at an average rate of one bit per picture-element (2 Megabits per second). When there is movement in the scene, most transmission time is devoted to the parts of the picture that change significantly. The data are generated irregularly but the data flow is smoothed prior to transmission in a buffer that holds about one frame of data. The redundancy reduction techniques used and the behavior of the coder are discussed both from an intuitive and from a statistical viewpoint. The positions of elements that change are signaled by addressing the first element of a run of changes and marking the end of the run with a special code word. The changes of luminance are transmitted as frame-to-frame differences using variable-length code words. When rapid motion makes the buffer more than a quarter full, only differences for every second element are transmitted, the values of the intervening changed elements being set equal to the average of their neighbors. If the buffer continues to fill, the threshold that determines which changes are significant is raised from 4/256 to 7/256 of the maximum signal value. When violent motion causes the buffer to fill completely, replenishment is stopped for about one frame while the buffer empties. Subsampling and raising the threshold are not objectionable because viewers rarely detect the small impairments introduced in moving images.

Such a circuit is representable by a cascade signal flow graph, a graph containing no feedback loops. Not all circuits can be so represented, of course, but the number which can is expanded by the technique to be described to include most feedback amplifier configurations.

An electronic digital computer was programmed to compute the electromagnetic field across the mirrors of the interferometer where an initially launched wave is reflected back and forth between the mirrors. It was found that after many reflections a state is reached in which the relative field distribution does not vary from transit to transit and the amplitude of the field decays at an exponential rate. This steady-state field distribution is regarded as a normal mode of the interferometer. Many such normal modes are possible depending upon the initial wave distribution. The lowest-order mode, which has the lowest diffraction loss, has a high intensity at the middle of the mirror and rather low intensities at the edges. Therefore, the diffraction loss is much lower than would be predicted for a uniform plane wave. Curves for field distribution and diffraction loss are given for different mirror geometries and different modes. Since each mode has a characteristic loss and phase shift per transit, a uniform plane wave which can be resolved into many modes cannot, properly speaking, be resonated in an interferometer. In the usual optical interferometers, the resolution is too poor to resolve the individual mode resonances and the uniform plane wave distribution may be maintained approximately. However, in an oscillating maser, the lowest-order mode should dominate if the mirror spacing is correct for resonance. A confocal spherical system has also been investigated and the losses are shown to be orders of magnitude less than for plane mirrors.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1961.tb01625.x","startPage":"453","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6771834/06771838.pdf","endPage":"488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1961.tb01625.x","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1961","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771838/","displayDocTitle":"Resonant modes in a maser interferometer","volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1961","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant modes in a maser interferometer","sourcePdf":"bstj402453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014059S","chronDate":"March  1961","isNumber":"6771834","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"212","articleId":"6771838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6771839,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It has been suggested that a plane-parallel Fabry-Perot interferometer could act as a suitable resonator. In this paper a resonator consisting of two identical concave spherical reflectors, separated by any distance up to twice their common radius of curvature, is considered. Mode patterns and diffraction losses for the low-loss modes of such a resonator are obtained analytically, using an approximate method which was suggested by W. D. Lewis. The results show that the diffraction losses are generally considerably lower for the curved surfaces than for the plane surfaces. Diffraction losses and mode volume are a minimum when the reflector spacing equals the common radius of curvature of the reflectors. For this case the resonator may be termed confocal. A further property of the concave spherical resonator is that the optical alignment is not extremely critical.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1961.tb01626.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6771834/06771839.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1961.tb01626.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Confocal multimode resonator for millimeter through optical wavelength masers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1961","displayDocTitle":"Confocal multimode resonator for millimeter through optical wavelength masers","volume":"40","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771839/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1961","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Confocal multimode resonator for millimeter through optical wavelength masers","sourcePdf":"bstj402489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015953S","chronDate":"March  1961","isNumber":"6771834","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"120","articleId":"6771839","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6771843,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An efficient maintenance routine, including rapid repair of faults, is an essential adjunct to the scheme if the potentially large increase in reliability made possible by error correction is to be realized. The percentage redundancy needed to realize the scheme decreases as the complexity of the system to which it is applied increases, but may amount to triplication of equipment even for moderately large systems.

With this method, signaling is faster than the Nyquist rate. Consequently, there are fewer points in the signal constellation, resulting in a greater separation of the points when the average transmitter power is the same as for QAM. Thus, at the expense of introducing Intersymbol Interference (ISI), there is an apparent improvement in noise immunity. The ISI can be mitigated with maximum likelihood sequence detection. We explore the advisability of trading freedom from ISI for added noise immunity for the extreme case where the system with faster signaling uses a four-point constellation. The question of the efficacy of FBS has been difficult to approach, but FBS has loomed as a possibly strong competitor among alternatives to QAM. We show here how to analyze FBS, and we give examples involving FBS operating at up to five times the QAM rate. In the examples, FBS is revealed to be, at best, of marginal value even if one allows for implementation capabilities far beyond those of forthcoming processors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1984","publicationDate":"Oct. 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"63","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Contrasting performance of faster binary signaling with QAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contrasting performance of faster binary signaling with QAM","sourcePdf":"bstj6381419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054014S","chronDate":"Oct.  1984","isNumber":"6771897","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731004","citationCount":"23","articleId":"6771898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6771899,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The interpolation procedure attempts to minimize the mean square interpolation error by recomputing the autocorrelation function of the speech sequence every W samples. We describe three methods of computing the correlation function. An iterative procedure is evaluated for estimating the correlation function of a speech sequence whose every nth sample has been discarded. For speech bandlimited to 3.2 kHz, sampled at 8 kHz, and n = 4, W = 256, the gain in signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) achieved by adaptive interpolation compared to nearest neighbor average interpolation was 14 and 8 dB, depending on whether the correlation function was computed from the original speech, or by using the iterative procedure, respectively. The effect of varying n from 2 to 6 was also investigated. Finally, we applied the interpolation procedures to 8-bit \u03bc-law pulse code modulation (PCM), \u03bc = 255, reducing 64 kb/s transmission to 48 kb/s by rejecting one PCM word in four. The recovered speech after interpolation had a s/n that approximated that of conventional 56 kb/s \u03bc-law PCM speech.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1983.tb03487.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1983.tb03487.x","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1398","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6771970/06771972.pdf","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6771970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample reduction and subsequent adaptive interpolation of speech signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1983","displayDocTitle":"Sample reduction and subsequent adaptive interpolation of speech signals","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"62","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6771972/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample reduction and subsequent adaptive interpolation of speech signals","sourcePdf":"bstj6261365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034018S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1983","isNumber":"6771970","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6771972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6772008,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald J.

When there is a frequency difference between these clocks, the equalizer compensates for the accumulated timing-phase difference by shifting the equalizer tap weights in the appropriate direction along the delay line. Performance, as measured by the mean-squared error, is not degraded until the center (largest) tap migrates toward one end of the equalizer. In this paper, we demonstrate how the spatial distribution of the equalizer coefficients can be used to lock the receiver sampling frequency to that of the transmitter. Replacing the standard envelope-derived timing recovery system with a closed-loop center-tap tracking algorithm offers significantly improved performance for narrow roll-off or severely-attenuated systems, reduced complexity, and a structure appropriate for all-digital receivers.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1987.tb00305.x","publicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"AT&T Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731003/6772018/06772024.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1987.tb00305.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772018","startPage":"63","endPage":"78","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Center-tap tracking algorithms for timing recovery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Center-tap tracking algorithms for timing recovery","chronOrPublicationDate":"November-December  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772024/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"November-December  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"6","publicationDate":"November-December 1987","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Center-tap tracking algorithms for timing recovery","sourcePdf":"bstj66663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024927S","chronDate":"November-December  1987","isNumber":"6772018","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731003","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6772024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6772042,"authors":[{"name":"Paul T.

Interactivity in this context means that the user is able to explore and navigate audio-visual scenes by freely choosing viewpoint and viewing direction. In order to provide this key feature, omnidirectional video is typically represented as a classical two-dimensional (2D) rectangular panorama video that is mapped onto a (spherical or cylindrical) mesh and then rendered on the client's screen. Early transmission models of this full panorama video and mesh content simply deal with the panorama as a high-resolution video to be encoded at uniform quality. Generally the user can only view a restricted field-of-view of the content and then interact with pan-tilt-zoom commands. This means that a significant part of the bandwidth is wasted by transmitting quality video in regions that are not being visualized. In this paper we evaluate the relevance and optimality of a personalized transmission where quality is modulated in spherical or cylindrical regions depending on their likelihood to be viewed during a live user interaction. We show, based on interaction delay as well as bandwidth constraints, how tiling and predictive methods can improve on existing methods. \u00a9 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.20538","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6772099/06772109.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive omnidirectional video delivery: A bandwidth-effective approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2012","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772109/","displayDocTitle":"Interactive omnidirectional video delivery: A bandwidth-effective approach","volume":"16","issue":"4","publicationDate":"March 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive omnidirectional video delivery: A bandwidth-effective approach","sourcePdf":"6772109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027783S","chronDate":"March  2012","isNumber":"6772099","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"31","articleId":"6772109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":6772110,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jiang"},{"name":"Chengbo Li","affiliation":["Technology Organization of ConocoPhillips in Houston, Texas"],"firstName":"Chengbo","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Raziel Haimi-Cohen","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey and a member of Alcatel-Lucent Technical Academy"],"firstName":"Raziel","lastName":"Haimi-Cohen"},{"name":"Paul A.

We assume that software development proceeds as a series of changes and model the probability that a change to software will cause a failure. We use predictors based on the properties of a change itself. Such predictors include size in lines of code added, deleted, and unmodified; diffusion of the change and its component subchanges, as reflected in the number of files, modules, and subsystems touched, or changed; several measures of developer experience; and the type of change and its subchanges (fault fixes or new code). The model is built on historic information and is used to predict the risk of new changes. In this paper we apply the model to 5ESS\u00ae software updates and find that change diffusion and developer experience are essential to predicting failures. The predictive model is implemented as a Web-based tool to allow timely prediction of change quality. The ability to predict the quality of change enables us to make appropriate decisions regarding inspection, testing, and delivery. Historic information on software changes is recorded in many commercial software projects, suggesting that our results can be easily and widely applied in practice.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April-June  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772130/","volume":"5","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April-June 2000","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Predicting risk of software changes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting risk of software changes","sourcePdf":"2229ftp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021271S","chronDate":"April-June  2000","isNumber":"6772117","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"92","articleId":"6772130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6772137,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Guo","affiliation":["Wireless Research and Development (R&D) Department at Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Guo"},{"name":"Wei Cao","affiliation":["Wireless Research and Development (R&D) Department at Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Cao"},{"name":"An Tao","affiliation":["Wireless business group at Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Tao"},{"name":"Dragan Samardzija","affiliation":["Wireless business group at Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Samardzija"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6772137","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1484},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772137","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","Bandwidth","Cloud computing","Baseband","Downlink","MIMO","OFDM","Next generation networking","GSM","Wireless networks","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","antenna arrays","cellular radio","code division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","next generation networks","OFDM modulation","quantisation (signal)","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE-LTE-A signal compression","CPRI interface","centralized-cooperative-cloud radio access network","C-RAN","next-generation wireless access network","centralized processing","collaborative radio","real time cloud infrastructure","Global System for Mobile Communications","GSM","time division synchronous code division multiple access","TD-SCDMA","wideband code division multiple access","WCDMA","Long Term Evolution","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","multiple input multiple output technology","MIMO technology","wireless access technology","3G-4G evolution","multiantenna MIMO","carrier aggregation","coordinated multipoint","data transmission","remote radio unit","RRU","baseband unit","BBU","block scaling","quantization error","propagation environment"]}],"abstract":"The Centralized, Cooperative, Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is a next-generation wireless access network architecture based on centralized processing, collaborative radio, and real time cloud infrastructure. In this architecture, different access technologies (Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)/Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA)/Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA)/Long Term Evolution (LTE)) can be supported on the same hardware platform in a baseband pool system, which can largely reduce system costs. Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A), which are based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technologies, are regarded as the main wireless access technologies in the evolution from 3G to 4G. A variety of novel technologies such as multi-antenna MIMO, carrier aggregation (CA), and coordinated multipoint have been introduced in LTE/LTE-A to improve system performance, especially in the C-RAN architecture. However, one of the technical challenges for the C-RAN architecture is the fiber bandwidth required for data transmission between the remote radio unit (RRU) and the baseband unit (BBU). We propose using a low-latency baseband signal compression algorithm to solve this problem by reducing the fiber data rate. Using the characteristics of the LTE signal data, we remove the redundancy in the spectral domain. We also leverage block scaling in conjunction with using a linear or nonlinear (non-uniform) quantizer to minimize quantization error. This algorithm effectively reduces the amount of data transmitted between the BBU and RRU, and facilitates the deployment of LTE in the C-RAN architecture. We verified the robustness of the algorithm via simulations and lab tests. The proposed algorithm yields good system performance at a 1/2 compression rate and at a 1/3 compression rate in a practical propagation environment.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.21608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21608","startPage":"117","endPage":"133","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6772133/06772137.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LTE/LTE-A signal compression on the CPRI interface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"LTE/LTE-A signal compression on the CPRI interface","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14870103","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LTE/LTE-A signal compression on the CPRI interface","sourcePdf":"6772137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031445S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","isNumber":"6772133","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"49","articleId":"6772137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6772139,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluca Boiocchi","affiliation":["Research and Development group in Alcatel-Lucent's Wireless Transmission product unit"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Boiocchi"},{"name":"Paolo Di Prisco","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent's Wireless Transmission product unit in Vimercate, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Di Prisco"},{"name":"Ahmed Lahrech","affiliation":["R&D Dept., Wireless Transm.

The triangulation techniques used for external locations are useless due to adverse effects like the lack of line-of-sight or to multipath propagation. Fingerprinting methods, which are based on the comparison of received signal strength (RSS) values measured by the mobile phone with a radiomap of RSS values recorded during the calibration phase, currently offer the best methods for indoor scenarios. However, they are also affected by problems like channel variability. In this paper, we propose two ways to improve the systems based on fingerprinting methods. The first method minimizes negative effects resulting from inadequate deployment of the radio frequency emitters and describes a method to determine the minimum number and the best way to locate them from initial layout and accuracy requirements. The second method increases accuracy thanks to an automatic radiomap recalibration technique that leverages the measurements reported by a small number of static reference points, strategically deployed in an indoors environment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile radio mobility management","Wireless LAN","Calibration","Mobile communication","Wireless networks","Support vector machines","Fingerprint recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","indoor navigation","indoor radio","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RSS values","indoors environment","static reference points","automatic radiomap recalibration technique","radio frequency emitters","channel variability","received signal strength","fingerprinting methods","triangulation techniques","wireless users","auto-calibration","cells deployment","wireless indoor positioning"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21614","startPage":"213","endPage":"235","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6772133/06772143.pdf","doi":"10.1002/bltj.21614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless indoor positioning: Effective deployment of cells and auto-calibration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Wireless indoor positioning: Effective deployment of cells and auto-calibration","accessionNumber":"14881199","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","volume":"18","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless indoor positioning: Effective deployment of cells and auto-calibration","sourcePdf":"6772143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027679S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","isNumber":"6772133","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","articleId":"6772143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6772144,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Balachandran","affiliation":["Bell Labs Networking Technologies research domain, in Murray Hill, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Krishna","lastName":"Balachandran"},{"name":"Joseph H.

Impairments due to interference are especially severe on the uplink, where near-far effects are more likely to be experienced. This paper provides a holistic view of the network-centric cooperation schemes that have emerged as strong candidates for uplink interference management in evolving cellular networks (e.g., networks based on 3GPP Long Term Evolution based air-interface technologies and beyond). In particular, we introduce three novel approaches: network multiple input multiple output (MIMO), which carries out joint multi-antenna signal processing across sectors; network interference cancellation engine (NICE) which opportunistically cancels dominant interferers that have already been decoded at neighboring sectors and decreases backhaul overhead by one to two orders of magnitude; and a hybrid approach which combines the strengths of both network MIMO and NICE in an attempt to achieve further spectral efficiency without incurring huge backhaul overhead. Several considerations of both theoretical and practical significance (overhead, latency) related to these approaches are discussed, and simpler variants that may apply in the context of heterogeneous networks are also considered. Quantitative investigations of these network-centric cooperation schemes in realistic operating environments show that substantial improvement may be achieved in average and cell-edge spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.21603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.21603","startPage":"23","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6772133/06772144.pdf","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-centric cooperation schemes for uplink interference management in cellular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Network-centric cooperation schemes for uplink interference management in cellular networks","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14870109","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772144/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-centric cooperation schemes for uplink interference management in cellular networks","sourcePdf":"6772144.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055997S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","isNumber":"6772133","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6772144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6772145,"authors":[{"name":"Jaime Calle-S\u00e1nchez","affiliation":["Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (UPM), Spain"],"firstName":"Jaime","lastName":"Calle-S\u00e1nchez"},{"name":"Mariano Molina-Garc\u00eda","affiliation":["Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM), Spain"],"firstName":"Mariano","lastName":"Molina-Garc\u00eda"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 I.

This paper describes the basic principles of 3D beamforming, including the impact of downtilt adaptation on the physical layer as well as the potential of its combination with beam coordination involving the media access control (MAC) layer.

This architecture is based on a cochannel deployment of macro base stations (BSs) with very large antenna arrays and a secondary tier of small cells (SCs) with a few antennas each. Both tiers employ a TDD protocol in a synchronized fashion. The resulting channel reciprocity enables not only the estimation of large-dimensional channels at the BSs, but also an implicit coordination between both tiers without the need to exchange user data or channel state information (CSI) over the backhaul. In particular, during the uplink (UL), the BSs and SCs can locally estimate the dominant interference sub-space. This knowledge can be leveraged for downlink (DL) precoding to reduce intra- and inter-tier interference. In other words, the BSs and SCs \u201csacrifice\u201d some of their degrees of freedom for interference rejection. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture and precoding scheme can achieve a very attractive rate region compared to several baseline scenarios.

In defining the delta modulation signal ensemble, we identify a binary phase parameter and show that when this parameter is random, the signal statistics are stationary, provided the input is stationary. Thus the delta modulation correlation functions depend on a single time variable and have Fourier transforms that are the power spectra of the delta modulation signals. After deriving the delta modulation correlation statistics and power density spectra, we use these functions to investigate the properties of the delta modulation granular quantizing noise. We demonstrate the ratio of input signal power to the quantizing noise power of three signals that approximate the system input. These signals are the integrated delta modulation signal, the signal at the output of the ideal low-pass interpolation filter usually considered in delta modulation studies, and the signal at the output of the optimum interpolation filter. We determine the properties of this filter by referring to the derived spectral density functions.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb04266.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6772152/06772157.pdf","startPage":"1197","endPage":"1218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb04266.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delta modulation granular quantizing noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Delta modulation granular quantizing noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772157/","volume":"48","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May-June 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1969","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1969","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delta modulation granular quantizing noise","sourcePdf":"bstj4851197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017098S","chronDate":"May-June  1969","isNumber":"6772152","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6772157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6772165,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Direct detection is provided by a photodetector whose output current is modeled as a noisy filtered Poisson stream of pulses. In this model, the time-varying pulse arrival rate is proportional to a linearly distorted version of the modulating signal. We show how the photodetector output is processed to derive the minimum probability-of-error receiver. Special attention is given to certain practical limiting cases. When the average energy in the response of the photodetector to an individual photon is small compared to the additive thermal noise, the optimum detector is shown to be linear except for the use of precomputed bias terms. At the other extreme are the photomultiplier and the avalanche photodiode where the average energy in the response of the photodetector to a single photon is large compared with the additive noise. In this situation, we show that the optimum detector estimates the photon arrival times and then uses these estimates in a weighted counter. In both limiting cases, the detectors are specialized to one-shot M-ary and synchronous multilevel pulse-amplitude modulated (pam) signals with intersymbol interference. For pam signaling, we demonstrate that finite system memory allows application of dynamic programming to provide a detector implementation whose computational complexity does not increase with time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum direct detection for digital fiber-optic communication systems","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1975.tb02041.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6772206/06772208.pdf","startPage":"1389","endPage":"1429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1975.tb02041.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772206","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772208/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1975","displayDocTitle":"Optimum direct detection for digital fiber-optic communication systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum direct detection for digital fiber-optic communication systems","sourcePdf":"bstj5481389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048118S","chronDate":"Oct.  1975","isNumber":"6772206","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"11","articleId":"6772208","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6772210,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In particular, the pulse energy seems to be the minimum distance up to rates of transmission 25 percent faster than the Nyguist rate, but not beyond. Some mathematical aspects related to the above problem are also considered. In particular, the minimum distance is rigorously shown to be nonzero for all transmission rates.

The amplification of single-sideband modulated signals requires an unusually low intermodulation noise level and relatively low thermal noise power at the amplifier output. Further, owing to the use of predistortion to achieve the overall repeater intermodulation level objective, the amplifier must perform at high stability. These objectives have been met by choosing suitable TWT design parameters, operating the tube far below its saturated power capability, and devoting close attention to the details of tube construction. The power supply provides well-regulated heater, helix, and collector voltages to control the TWT gain. The supply also regulates the beam current. Current detection circuits protect the tube and power supply from tube internal arcs.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1983.tb03481.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6772315/06772341.pdf","startPage":"3429","endPage":"3445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1983.tb03481.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The AR6A Single-Sideband Microwave Radio System: The Traveling-Wave-Tube amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"The AR6A Single-Sideband Microwave Radio System: The Traveling-Wave-Tube amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772341/","volume":"62","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Dec. 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1983","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The AR6A Single-Sideband Microwave Radio System: The Traveling-Wave-Tube amplifier","sourcePdf":"bstj62103429.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015706S","chronDate":"Dec.  1983","isNumber":"6772315","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6772341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6772441,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The technique requires no increase in transmission rate.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1979.tb02261.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6772426/06772441.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1979.tb02261.x","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of transmission error propagation in adaptively predicted, DPCM encoded pictures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of transmission error propagation in adaptively predicted, DPCM encoded pictures","volume":"58","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of transmission error propagation in adaptively predicted, DPCM encoded pictures","sourcePdf":"bstj5861413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031969S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1979","isNumber":"6772426","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6772441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6772450,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We discuss how these noises accumulate and combine along a chain of repeaters. The theoretical work is from the viewpoint of frequency analysis which leads easily to the spectrum of the timing noise. We first give a simple form of this theory applicable in a number of cases, and then a more general form useful in other cases, which shows the approximations and limitations of the simple theory. We found that the spectrum of timing noise caused by tank circuit mistuning has no energy at zero frequency and because of this fact, timing noise from this source does not build up indefinitely along a chain of repeaters but soon reaches a limit. On the other hand, the spectrum of timing noise caused by amplitude to phase conversion does have energy at zero frequency; thus, timing noise from this source increases indefinitely along a repeater chain. Some of the timing noise is attributable to pulse shape alone and in some cases may include a very low frequency part. This latter comes about through the small energy near the harmonics of the pulse rate in the tuned circuit response and the aliasing of this energy down to very low frequencies by the sampling process used in measuring the phase deviation or in generating the retiming pulses.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01129.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6772449/06772453.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01129.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The generation and accumulation of timing noise in PCM systems-an experimental and theoretical study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772453/","displayDocTitle":"The generation and accumulation of timing noise in PCM systems-an experimental and theoretical study","volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1969","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The generation and accumulation of timing noise in PCM systems-an experimental and theoretical study","sourcePdf":"bstj4830541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043331S","chronDate":"March  1969","isNumber":"6772449","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"25","articleId":"6772453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6772458,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The N n-bit symbols in a block are transmitted separately and independently through N parallel subsystems, each consisting of a sequential coder, an independent discrete memoryless channel, and a sequential decoder in tandem. Those coded n-bit symbols which would require the most sequential decoding computations are treated as erasures and decoded by a Reed-Solomon decoder.

When these codes are used on a binary channel they are effective for both random and burst error correction because a single character spans several channel digits. These codes have greater error-correcting capabilities than the Robinson-Bernstein self-orthogonal codes but are harder to decode. The single-character-error-correcting codes, when interleaved, are shown to be more powerful than the equivalent Hagelbarger code and appear to be simpler to implement. They are also slightly better than the interleaved version of Berlekamp's code. We discuss encoding and decoding algorithms and illustrate a simple decoding algorithm for some of the codes. These codes are closely related to the Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem block codes and share with them the decoding simplification for character erasures in place of errors.

The method is based on the analysis of a simple one- or two-port network for each of the n eigenmodes of the power-divider structure, resulting in a considerable improvement in the speed of computation, as well as a sizable reduction in storage requirements, as compared to a standard method of nodal analysis. Furthermore, the aforementioned one- and two-port networks facilitate the design and optimization of the power dividers over a desired frequency band.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1980.tb03376.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6772464/06772477.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1980.tb03376.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","startPage":"1493","endPage":"1512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of the frequency response of a class of symmetric N-way power dividers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1980","displayDocTitle":"Computation of the frequency response of a class of symmetric N-way power dividers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772477/","volume":"59","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of the frequency response of a class of symmetric N-way power dividers","sourcePdf":"bstj5981493.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014563S","chronDate":"Oct.  1980","isNumber":"6772464","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6772477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6772485,"authors":[{"name":"J.

They have a small form factor and are typically equipped with powerful processors, a large display, a high-resolution camera, and specialized sensors. The hardware has to simultaneously support applications that have varying run-times and varying communication and computation requirements. As a consequence, power-intensive applications can easily drain the battery and leave the mobile terminal useless in no time. In this paper, we develop concepts for advanced power-aware task management. A power-aware task monitor in the mobile terminal keeps track of the battery state, the communication channel, and the processor(s). It takes the application profile, channel quality, anticipated duration, and other factors into account to determine the required resources and the impact on the battery life, and it also updates the battery and application profiles. A power-aware task scheduler in the mobile terminal uses information provided by the power-aware task monitor to determine whether or not to execute applications. It can reserve power for critical services such as emergency calls, authentication, and payment and banking applications. Network-based power management and application-based power management can be achieved for mobile terminals when information about the handset's battery power and application profile is communicated to the network. A network-based power manager can help determine when and how to support power-intensive applications, and may provide the handset with location-based coverage information and adjust the communication strategy to reduce the power required for communication and processing in the handset. A power manager in the application server can help to minimize power consumption by adjusting the flow and the contents communicated to the mobile terminal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Smart power management for mobile handsets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart power management for mobile handsets","sourcePdf":"6772563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028848S","chronDate":"March  2011","isNumber":"6772552","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6772563","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6772574,"authors":[{"name":"P.

High-order diversity, and hence, strong interference suppression, can be achieved with modest hardware complexity by using time-division retransmission. With this technique, which is especially well-suited to digital modulation methods, the adaptive signal processing required for space diversity can be performed at just one end of the communication link, namely, the base station. At the other end (the mobile unit) only a single-element antenna is needed. Moreover, the use of coherent phase-shift keying in such a system allows simple RF circuity, because the adaptive processing is done at baseband. In the context of cellular mobile radio, the combination of space diversity, time-division retransmission and 120-degree corner illumination of each cell can yield a reliable communication channel even in the presence of intercell interference, Ray leigh fading (both flat and frequency-selective), and shadow fading.

The single-sideband signal changes its carrier frequency every \u03c4 seconds, and the sequence of carrier frequencies is controlled by a suitable scrambling code. Co-channel cells using the same frequency band in the mobile radio system use different scrambling codes with the result that co-channel interference is altered from cross-talk to random noise if \u03c4 is small. In the presence of Rayleigh fading, frequency hopping improves reception for stationary vehicles, and does not degrade the performance for moving vehicles.

Calculations of the coupling between a satellite ground station and a radio-relay station due to scattering by rain are given for the frequencies 4, 6, 11, 18.5 and 30 GHz. Several models of the rain environment are considered, one in which the rain falls uniformly over the path, and others involving localized showers in the earth-station beam. The beam of the earth-station antenna is taken to be elevated 30\u00b0 above the local horizon. Interstation distances from 5 km to 200 km and rain rates up to 400 mm/hr are considered. The analysis includes the near field of the earth-station antenna and shows that attenuation by the rain on the path plays an important role at the higher frequencies. The greatest coupling occurs when the beam of the earth-station antenna is pointed opposite to the azimuth of the relay station. In that case, when the radio-relay antenna response in the direction of the earth station is isotropic, the maximum couplings are \u2212132 dB and \u2212 164 dB at 4 GHz with separations of 5 km and 200 km respectively, for a rain rate of 400 mm/hr.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6772630/06772645.pdf","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1511","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01840.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01840.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some calculations on coupling between satellite communications and terrestrial radio-relay systems due to scattering by rain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1970","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1970","displayDocTitle":"Some calculations on coupling between satellite communications and terrestrial radio-relay systems due to scattering by rain","volume":"49","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some calculations on coupling between satellite communications and terrestrial radio-relay systems due to scattering by rain","sourcePdf":"bstj4971491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05791S","chronDate":"Sept.  1970","isNumber":"6772630","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6772645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-09"},{"_id":6772654,"authors":[{"name":"N.

We identify the key building blocks for enabling elastic optical networks to provide desired performance improvements over static optical networks. We examine the design of elastic transponders capable of data rate adaptation, interfaces between client packet devices and transponders supporting flexible traffic aggregation, and associated algorithms for traffic grooming and routing. We also perform network cost/energy analyses.

This problem of \u201cdoing things right\u201d on a large scale is not essentially new; in a telephone central office, for example, a very large number of operations are performed while the errors leading to wrong numbers are kept well under control, though they have not been completely eliminated. This has been achieved, in part, through the use of self-checking circuits. The occasional failure that escapes routine checking is still detected by the customer and will, if it persists, result in customer complaint, while if it is transient it will produce only occasional wrong numbers. At the same time the rest of the central office functions satisfactorily. In a digital computer, on the other hand, a single failure usually means the complete failure, in the sense that if it is detected no more computing can be done until the failure is located and corrected, while if it escapes detection then it invalidates all subsequent operations of the machine. Put in other words, in a telephone central office there are a number of parallel paths which are more or less independent of each other; in a digital machine there is usually a single long path which passes through the same piece of equipment many, many times before the answer is obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772729/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1950","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1950","volume":"29","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 1950","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error detecting and error correcting codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error detecting and error correcting codes","sourcePdf":"bstj292147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054791S","chronDate":"April  1950","isNumber":"6772728","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"893","articleId":"6772729","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1950","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6772778,"authors":[{"name":"James F.

It is found to be a high pass, impedance transforming filter. The cutoff frequency depends upon the rate of taper. The deviation of the exponential line from an ideal impedance transformer may be decreased by an order of magnitude by shunting the low impedance end with an inductance and inserting a capacitance in series with the high impedance end. The magnitudes of these reactances are equal to the impedance level at their respective ends of the line at the cutoff frequency. For a two-to-one impedance transformer the line is 0.0551 wave-lengths long at the cutoff frequency. For a four-to-one impedance transformer the line is 0.1102 wave-lengths long at the cutoff frequency, etc. The results have been verified experimentally. Practical lines 50 meters and 15 meters long have been constructed which transform from 600 to 300 ohms over the frequency range from 4 to 30 mc. with deviations from the ideal that are small compared with the deviations from the ideal of commercial transmission lines, either two-wire or concentric. When an exponential line is used as a dissipative load of known impedance instead of a uniform line it is possible to approach more nearly the ideal of constant heat dissipation per unit length. This makes it possible to use a shorter line.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772799/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1938","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1938","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 1938","displayDocTitle":"The exponential transmission line","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The exponential transmission line","sourcePdf":"bstj174555.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017035S","chronDate":"Oct.  1938","isNumber":"6772795","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"24","articleId":"6772799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1938","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6772808,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The equalizer tap weights are adjusted by starting the transmission with a short training sequence of digital data known in advance by the receiver. This paper analyzes the situation when the known training sequence is replaced by a sequence of data symbols estimated from the equalizer output and treated as known data. Such procedures are called \u201cdecision-directed\u201d startup. With a known training sequence, the \u201cleast-mean-square\u201d adjustment algorithm corresponds mathematically to searching for the unique minimum of a quadratic \u201cerror\u201d surface whose unimodal nature assures convergence. In decision-directed startup, by contrast, the use of estimated and unreliable data changes the error surface into a multimodal one so that complex behavior may result. We describe the nature of the error surfaces for binary and four-level transmission, thereby gaining insight into convergence problems. The most significant conclusion is that a poor choice for the initial tap settings may result in the taps converging to an undesirable setting. We show that, because of finite step-size effects, fluctuations are significant at the undesired settings and cause the spurious capture to have a long, but finite, duration. Finally we provide information on stability, convergence times, and lifetimes and their relation to the adaptation parameter (step size).","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1980.tb03341.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6772806/06772808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1980.tb03341.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772806","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of decision-directed equalizer convergence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of decision-directed equalizer convergence","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1980","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Dec. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of decision-directed equalizer convergence","sourcePdf":"bstj59101857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018388S","chronDate":"Dec.  1980","isNumber":"6772806","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"71","articleId":"6772808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6772812,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These include the distortion caused by a limit on the available correction gain, the distortion resulting from frequency selective fading, the degradation of the signal-to-interference (S/I) [noise (S/N)] ratio, and the distortion induced because of interference to the pilot from a cochannel pilot or from noise. We have investigated these impairments for a specific feedforward, phase- and gain-correcting, ideal receiver. For this receiver, the S/I ratio is degraded at baseband because of the time-varying nature of the gain correction signal and the assumption that the correction signal is correlated with the desired voice signal fading envelope but is independent of the interferer fading envelope. A limit on correction gain appears necessary to limit the magnitude of several of the impairments, and has been considered as a parameter in the analysis of each impairment type. The results are here extended to characterize an \u201cequal-gain\u201d space diversity receiver. Diversity combining is applied after phase correction, but before gain correction to maintain proper voice correction while retaining the benefits of the improved envelope statistics. This paper deals only with the SSB idealized channel, not with a system employing SSB modulation; the authors recognize that many complicated systems problems (eg., antenna combining, channel generation, and cost reduction) must be solved before a working system using the channel analyzed herein can become a reality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impairment mechanisms for SSB mobile communications at UHF with pilot-based doppler/fading correction","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1980.tb03345.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6772806/06772812.pdf","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1980.tb03345.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772806","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1980","displayDocTitle":"Impairment mechanisms for SSB mobile communications at UHF with pilot-based doppler/fading correction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 1980","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impairment mechanisms for SSB mobile communications at UHF with pilot-based doppler/fading correction","sourcePdf":"bstj59101923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055659S","chronDate":"Dec.  1980","isNumber":"6772806","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6772812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6772902,"authors":[{"name":"Pratyush Mogh\u00e9","affiliation":["Network and Service Management Research Department at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Pratyush","lastName":"Mogh\u00e9"},{"name":"Asawaree Kalavade","affiliation":["DSP and VLSI Systems Research Department at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey"],"firstName":"Asawaree","lastName":"Kalavade"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1538-7305"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7089"}],"articleNumber":"6772902","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6772902","abstract":"An intensive effort is under way to support networked multimedia applications on slim hosts or terminals such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and set-top boxes. In addition to their limited processing capabilities, these terminals may use limited network bandwidth conditions \u2014 for example, wireless links. One way to implement multimedia applications on terminals is to make them adaptive. Such applications can then use bandwidth availability in the network as feedback to adapt their output packet rate. This manages the bandwidth scarcity by preventing the network congestion from worsening beyond a point. However, such an implementation imposes unique challenges. Simple task-level processing variations in audio/video applications can seriously overload a terminal. Adaptive applications impose even more variability. Consequently, the processing delay of applications can become unpredictable. We classify processing delay as a terminal quality of service (QoS) measure since it determines the overall perceptual quality of applications. We design a framework that can quantify the terminal QoS through the processing delay distribution. Our framework is broad enough to be used across several applications, terminal system architectures, and run-time schedulers. At Bell Labs, we have implemented the framework in a tool called AsaP. Its output can be used to design adaptive applications, application managers, and both software and architecture support for terminals and other networked embedded systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6772896","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6772896/06772902.pdf","doi":"10.1002/bltj.2106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.2106","startPage":"76","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terminal QoS of adaptive applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April-June  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6772902/","displayDocTitle":"Terminal QoS of adaptive applications","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"April-June 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terminal QoS of adaptive applications","sourcePdf":"2106ftp.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03035S","chronDate":"April-June  1998","isNumber":"6772896","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","articleId":"6772902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6773017,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Printing telegraph is an outstanding example. Here, time is divided into equal divisions, and the number of magnitudes to be distinguished in any one interval is usually no more than two, corresponding to the closed or open positions of a sending switch. It is only in recent years, however, that the development of high speed electronic devices has progressed sufficiently to enable quantizing techniques to be applied to rapidly changing signals such as produced by speech, music, or television. Quantizing of time, or time division, has found application as a means of multiplexing telephone channels.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n The method consists of connecting the different channels to the line in sequence by fast moving switches synchronized at the transmitting and receiving ends. In this way a transmission medium capable of handling a much wider band of frequencies than required for one telephone channel can be used simultaneously by a group of channels without mutual interference. The plan is the same as that used in multiplex telegraphy. The difference is that ordinary rotating machinery suffices at the relatively low speeds employed by the latter, while the high speeds needed for time division multiplex telephony can be realized only by practically inertialess electron streams. Also the widths of frequency band required for multiplex telephony are enormously greater than needed for the telegraph, and in fact have become technically feasible only with the development of wide-band radio and cable transmission systems. As far as any one channel is concerned the result is the same as in telegraphy, namely that signals are received at discrete or quantized times.

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb00917.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773065/06773067.pdf","startPage":"623","endPage":"656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb00917.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mathematical theory of communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1948","displayDocTitle":"A mathematical theory of communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773067/","publicationDate":"Oct. 1948","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1948","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mathematical theory of communication","sourcePdf":"bstj274623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041083S","chronDate":"Oct.  1948","isNumber":"6773065","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"1102","articleId":"6773067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1948","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6773080,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The viscous damping coefficient for this wall, which is a measure of the losses associated with domain wall motion in this material, has been measured as a function of temperature. This damping shows a very large increase as the temperature goes down to the region of 77\u00b0K. The value of this damping is correlated with the Landau-Lifshitz equation for the rotational motion of magnetization by means of previously available theoretical analysis. In addition, it is suggested that the sharp increase in damping at low temperatures is due to a relaxation associated with a rearrangement of the valence electrons on the divalent and trivalent iron ions in the ferrite.

The most obvious example is that of vacuum tube oscillators, where the feed-back is carried beyond the singing point. Another application is the 21-circuit test of balance, in which the current due to the unbalance between two impedances is fed back, the gain being increased until singing occurs. Still other applications are cases where portions of the output current of amplifiers are fed back to the input either unintentionally or by design. For the purpose of investigating the stability of such devices they may be looked on as amplifiers whose output is connected to the input through a transducer. This paper deals with the theory of stability of such systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1932","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1932","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773211/","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1932","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Regeneration theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regeneration theory","sourcePdf":"bstj111126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025871S","chronDate":"Jan.  1932","isNumber":"6773205","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"176","articleId":"6773211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1932","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6773227,"authors":[{"name":"Werner Ulrich","firstName":"Werner","lastName":"Ulrich"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0005-8580"}],"articleNumber":"6773227","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-binary error correction codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773227","abstract":"If a noisy channel is used to transmit more than two distinct signals, information may have to be specially coded to permit occasional errors to be corrected. If pulse amplitude modulation is used, the most probable error is a small one, e.g., 6 is changed to 7 or 5. Codes for correcting single small errors, and for correcting single small errors and detecting double small errors, in a message of arbitrary length, for an arbitrary number of different signals in the channel, are derived in this paper. For more specialized situations, the error is not necessarily restricted to a small value. Codes are derived for correcting any single unrestricted error in a message of arbitrary length for an arbitrary number of different signals Finally, a set of codes based partially upon the Reed-Muller codes is described for correcting a number of errors in a more restricted class of message lengths for an arbitrary number of different signals The described codes are readily implemented. Many techniques are used which have an analog in a binary system. Other techniques are broadly analogous to binary coding techniques or are special adaptations of a binary code.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb01514.x","startPage":"1341","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773225/06773227.pdf","endPage":"1388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb01514.x","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773227/","displayDocTitle":"Non-binary error correction codes","volume":"36","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1957","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-binary error correction codes","sourcePdf":"bstj3661341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.012101S","chronDate":"Nov.  1957","isNumber":"6773225","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"26","articleId":"6773227","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6773228,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In general if N signal channels are to be provided over one line, the switching cycle includes N equal time intervals, one of which is allotted to each channel. Each channel is connected to the line throughout a part of its particular time interval and is disconnected throughout the remainder of the cycle. Absence of interference between the channels depends upon the fact that the channels are connected to the line throughout mutually exclusive time intervals. It is thus possible to avoid the use of channel band filters such as are necessary in carrier systems employing frequency as the basis of separation.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773356","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1941.tb03601.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773353/06773356.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1941.tb03601.x","startPage":"199","endPage":"221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773353","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time division multiplex systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Time division multiplex systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1941","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1941","volume":"20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 1941","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time division multiplex systems","sourcePdf":"bstj202199.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036538S","chronDate":"April  1941","isNumber":"6773353","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"18","articleId":"6773356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1941","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6773368,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The frequency would be in the range extending from 1 to 50 kmc. The negative Q may be as low as 10 and the efficiency as high as 30 per cent. The diode is biased in reverse so as to establish a depletion, or space-charge, layer of fixed width in a relatively high resistance region, bounded by very low resistance end regions. The electric field has a maximum at one edge of the space-charge region, where hole-electron pairs are generated by internal secondary emission, or avalanche. The holes (or electrons) travel across the space-charge layer with constant velocity, thus producing a current through the diode. Because of the build-up time of the avalanche, and the transit time of the holes across the depletion layer, the alternating current is delayed by approximately one-half cycle relative to the ac voltage. Thus, power is delivered to the ac signal. When the diode is mounted in an inductive microwave cavity tuned to the capacity of the diode, an oscillation will build up. It appears possible to obtain over 20 watts of ac power in continuous operation at 5 kmc.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1958.tb01527.x","startPage":"401","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773407/06773412.pdf","endPage":"446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1958.tb01527.x","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1958","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773412/","displayDocTitle":"A proposed high-frequency, negative-resistance diode","volume":"37","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1958","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposed high-frequency, negative-resistance diode","sourcePdf":"bstj372401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035016S","chronDate":"March  1958","isNumber":"6773407","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"143","articleId":"6773412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6773428,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The latter is equivalent to a periodic sequence of lenses with unequal focal lengths. This treatment is in Cartesian coordinates as previously used. In an appendix the modes and resonant formulas are written in cylindrical coordinates. The effect of unequal aperture size of the two reflectors is shown to produce mode patterns of unequal size on the two reflectors of a confocal resonator. The previous computations for diffraction losses are found to be applicable. Generalization of the theory to the case of reflectors of unequal curvature shows the existence of low-loss regions and high-loss regions as the reflector spacing is varied. One of the high diffraction loss regions occurs when the reflector spacing is between the two unequal radii of curvature. Such a region is interpretable in terms of instabilities in a periodic sequence of lenses of unequal focal length. An estimate of diffraction losses is obtained for the low-loss regions.

A natural algebraic and combinatorial approach to the study of rearrangeable networks is described, with attention centered principally on two-sided networks built of stages of square crossbar switches, each stage having N inlets and N outlets.

It utilizes a pulse repetition frequency of 1.544 mc, and 6000-ft repeater spacing. Functionally, the repeatered line transmits the PCM signal without appreciable degradation over distances up to 25 miles, a feat accomplished by retiming and reshaping the signal at each repeater point. Retiming is accomplished by means of a clock extracted from the signal; reshaping is accomplished by regeneration with positive pulse width control. Near-end crosstalk and pulse train jitter dominate the design parameters. Timing is made tolerant of near-end crosstalk by choice of bipolar transmission (where successive marks are of opposite polarity) with clock derived from the rectified and clipped signal. Tolerance in the decision circuit is obtained by automatic threshold control, spike sampling, and tight control of time and voltage parameters. Accumulated pulse train jitter is controlled to the extent dictated by the terminal equipment, principally through control of the bandwidth of the clock circuit. Seven diffused-base transistors and ten logic diodes are used in the oneway repeater circuit. A two-way repeater consists of two such circuits with a common power unit, utilizes 135 components, and is packaged in a can of \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1{1 \\over 16} x 3{1 \\over 8} x 5{3\\over 4}$</tex>\n-inches outside dimensions.

A code and repeater structure for reconstructing this code to minimize the effect of crosstalk into the timing channel of a reconstructive repeater is emphasized. It is shown that the conventional self-timed unipolar repeater is not suited to this environment. Several pseudo-ternary codes are developed and surveyed for overcoming crosstalk interference.

However, no attempt in this direction has been made for the variable capacitance amplifier. It is the purpose of this paper to present the theory of a cold test procedure for parametric amplifiers. The cold test is essentially the measurement of the impedance locus of the input, the output and the pump circuits under the no-pump condition, with the diode bias voltage as the variable parameter. From these impedance loci one can evaluate all the important circuit parameters of the equivalent circuit of the parametric amplifier, including the value of the dynamic quality factor of the diode. Using these data, it is relatively easy to design or adjust the circuit so as to give the best noise performance. Since the theory of the cold test procedure neglects the effects of (1) higher harmonics, (2) any parallel conductance of the diode, and (3) circuit losses, the validity of the theory can be established only by experiment. For this reason, this paper also presents some of the experimental results obtained with a 6-kmc degenerate amplifier. The correlation between theory and experiment has proved to be excellent.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1962.tb03272.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1962.tb03272.x","startPage":"361","endPage":"381","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773557/06773569.pdf","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of passive circuit measurements for the adjustment of variable capacitance amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1962","displayDocTitle":"On the use of passive circuit measurements for the adjustment of variable capacitance amplifiers","publicationDate":"Jan. 1962","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773569/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of passive circuit measurements for the adjustment of variable capacitance amplifiers","sourcePdf":"bstj411361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014657S","chronDate":"Jan.  1962","isNumber":"6773557","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6773569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6773576,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For each channel the theoretical capabilities of \u201cbounded discrepancy decoding\u201d are studied. The \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d between two vectors is a distance or distance-like quantity defined such that the optimal decoder is a \u201cminimum discrepancy decoder.\u201d For example, for channel A the discrepancy is the Hamming distance, and for channel B the discrepancy is the Euclidean distance. Bounded discrepancy decoding is a nonoptimal decoding scheme in which disjoint regions in the space of possible received vectors are constructed about each code word, each region consisting of those vectors within a fixed discrepancy of that code word. For example, in channels A and B the regions are spheres with centers at the code words and radius d/2 where d is the minimum distance between code words.

This technique, called Chirp at Bell Telephone Laboratories, recognizes that resolution depends on the transmitted pulse bandwidth. A long high-duty-factor transmitted pulse, with suitable modulation (linear frequency modulation in the case of Chirp), which covers a frequency interval many times the inherent bandwidth of the envelope, is employed. The receiver is designed to make optimum use of the additional signal bandwidth. This paper contains many of the important analytical methods required for the design of a Chirp radar system. The details of two signal generation methods are considered and the resulting signal waveforms and power spectra are calculated. The required receiver characteristics are derived and the receiver output waveforms are presented. The time-bandwidth product is introduced and related to the effective increase in the performance of Chirp systems. The concept of a matched filler is presented and used as a reference standard in receiver design. The effect of amplitude and phase distortion is analyzed by the method of paired echoes. One consequence of the signal design is the presence of time side lobes on the receiver output pulse analogous to the spatial side lobes in antenna theory. A method to reduce the time side lobes by weighting the pulse energy spectrum is explained in terms of paired echoes. The weighting process is described, and calculated pulse envelopes, weighting network characteristics and dele-???","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1960.tb03942.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773596/06773600.pdf","startPage":"745","endPage":"808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1960.tb03942.x","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The theory and design of chirp radars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1960","displayDocTitle":"The theory and design of chirp radars","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773600/","publicationDate":"July 1960","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1960","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The theory and design of chirp radars","sourcePdf":"bstj394745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020665S","chronDate":"July  1960","isNumber":"6773596","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"316","articleId":"6773600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6773618,"authors":[{"name":"Tingye Li","firstName":"Tingye","lastName":"Li"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0005-8580"}],"articleNumber":"6773618","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773618","abstract":"The losses, phase shifts and field distribution functions for the two lowest-order modes of interferometer-type maser resonators consisting of spherically curved mirrors with circular apertures are computed by solving a pair of integral equations numerically on a digital computer.

The letters of the alphabet are the rows of the vector space, each consisting of n symbols from the ground field. The weight of a letter is the number of nonzero symbols it contains. The minimum weight of the letters of the alphabet, excluding zero, is denoted by d. A relationship is established between the alphabet and a set of points S in a finite projective space. There is a many-one correspondence between the letters of the alphabet and the hyperplanes of the space. The weight of a letter is simply related to the incidence of the set S with the corresponding hyperplane. Two sets of points in a finite projective space are called equivalent if they are related by a collineation of the space. Two alphabets are called equivalent if there exists between them, as vector spaces, a weight-preserving semi-isomorphism. It is shown that these definitions mean the same thing and reduce to the usual definition when q = 2. An inequality is established between the dimension of the alphabet and the parameters d, q, n. This gives a lower bound for n in terms of the other parameters. It is shown that this bound cannot be achieved by alphabets with repeated columns. A method is given for constructing a class of alphabets which attain this bound. It is shown that for the case q = 2 these are the only alphabets (in the sense of equivalence) for which the bound is attained.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773669","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1961.tb03986.x","startPage":"281","endPage":"308","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773657/06773669.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1961.tb03986.x","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773669/","displayDocTitle":"Error-correcting codes for multiple-level transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1961","volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-correcting codes for multiple-level transmission","sourcePdf":"bstj401281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036895S","chronDate":"Jan.  1961","isNumber":"6773657","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6773669","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6773670,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The data show that there is usually measurable (0.02 degree/(MHz)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n) phase distortion over the 20-MHz band during those fades whose depth exceeds about 20 dB. These dispersive fades, which usually last a few seconds, typically occur along with shallow and essentially nondispersive fades that have durations of several minutes. However, only the dispersive fades exhibit a phase nonlinearity. Analysis of 16 events measured in the autumn of 1970 yield the following results. (i) The distribution curve describing the fraction of time that phase nonlinearity (quadratic) exceeds a given value follows a lognormal distribution. (ii) The quadratic phase nonlinear coefficient exceeds an average value of 0.1 degree/(MHz)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n for fades with depth larger than 34 dB from the nominal level. This corresponds to a time delay distortion of 0.55 nanosecond over 1-MHz band. (iii) The correlation between log-amplitude and phase nonlinear coefficients yields a correlation coefficient whose magnitude is fade-depth dependent and whose sign varies from event to event. The experimental technique of measuring phase dispersion reported here may be of interest not only for propagation studies but also in other systems such as measurement of characteristics of electrical networks. The statistical results obtained on the phase characteristics may prove of interest in formulating an analytical model. Further, they may be of significance in the design of existing and future microwave systems.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb02713.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773694/06773705.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb02713.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773694","startPage":"1877","endPage":"1902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase dispersion characteristics during fade in a microwave line-of-sight Radio channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Phase dispersion characteristics during fade in a microwave line-of-sight Radio channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1973","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Dec. 1973","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase dispersion characteristics during fade in a microwave line-of-sight Radio channel","sourcePdf":"bstj52101877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022908S","chronDate":"Dec.  1973","isNumber":"6773694","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6773705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6773723,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For convenience we used a constant signaling rate of 32 kb/s and adjusted the source-coding and channel-coding rates in response to changing transmission quality. When the channel quality was good enough, we used all 32 kb/s for speech transmission. When the channel quality was lower, we reduced the source rate to 24 or 16 kb/s and introduced channel coding to control distortion due to transmission errors. We concentrated on specific source and channel codes that could be implemented with hardware of modest complexity. The source code was embedded differential pulse code modulation, which is amenable to variable-bit-rate operation and economical to implement. For error control we introduced punctured convolutional codes and a Viterbi decoder with only 16 states. Although the source/channel codec was simple, it offered good performance. Speech quality was at the level of normal telephony when the channel was good; the error-correcting codes extended by up to 13 dB the range of channel signal-to-noise ratios that support adequate quality. Our performance estimates were based on a new analysis of transmission errors in embedded differential pulse code modulation and on computer simulations of speech transmission through fixed and fading channels.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1983.tb03528.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773782/06773789.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1983.tb03528.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773782","startPage":"2017","endPage":"2036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined source and channel coding for variable-bit-rate speech transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","displayDocTitle":"Combined source and channel coding for variable-bit-rate speech transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773789/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined source and channel coding for variable-bit-rate speech transmission","sourcePdf":"bstj6272017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029555S","chronDate":"Sept.  1983","isNumber":"6773782","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"39","articleId":"6773789","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6773813,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Granular noise exists because the decoded output signal can assume only a specified number of levels in the range of interest. Slope overload noise occurs when the slope of the input signal is greater than the delta modulator is capable of reproducing. When the S/N ratio is not too small, the noise power from these two sources is additive. A formula for the slope overload noise power for Gaussian input signals is derived. This is used with an earlier result for the granular noise to give over-all signal-to-quantizing-noise ratios.

Sensitivities are considered for transmission bit rates of 45 Mb/s, 90 Mb/s, and 274 Mb/s \u2014 values characteristic of present long-wavelength systems. We find that general relationships and scaling laws between receiver sensitivity and the other critical parameters can be formulated if the sensitivity is calculated in units relative to the quantum limit. An important result is that the improvement in APD sensitivity depends strongly on dark current, but only weakly on the ionization coefficient ratio.

We also include a brief discussion comparing APD sensitivities with those obtained using phototransistors and majority carrier devices.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1982.tb02285.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773922/06773927.pdf","startPage":"2929","endPage":"2946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1982.tb02285.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity of avalanche photodetector receivers for long-wavelength optical communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity of avalanche photodetector receivers for long-wavelength optical communications","volume":"61","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity of avalanche photodetector receivers for long-wavelength optical communications","sourcePdf":"bstj61102929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042265S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"6773922","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"11","articleId":"6773927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6773931,"authors":[{"name":"Uzi Timor","firstName":"Uzi","lastName":"Timor"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0005-8580"}],"articleNumber":"6773931","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":42},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitone frequency-hopped MFSK system for mobile radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773931","abstract":"A digital spread spectrum technique employing frequency hopping and multilevel frequency-shift keying has recently been examined for possible application in mobile radiotelephony. Two system parameters, the number of bits per message and the number of tones in the frequency-hopping sequence, are determined by the available bandwidth and the data rate of each user. These parameters in turn determine the tone duration, which strongly influences the vulnerability of the system to transmission distortions. In this paper we describe a generalization of the MFSK scheme that allows users to transmit more than one tone simultaneously. Multitone transmission makes it possible for designers to increase the duration of each tone by increasing the total number of system frequencies. This flexibility slightly increases maximum efficiency and makes the system less vulnerable to multipath delay spread. It could also have implementation advantages.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1982.tb02289.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773922/06773931.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1982.tb02289.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773922","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","startPage":"3007","endPage":"3017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multitone frequency-hopped MFSK system for mobile radio","volume":"61","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitone frequency-hopped MFSK system for mobile radio","sourcePdf":"bstj61103007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027366S","chronDate":"Dec.  1982","isNumber":"6773922","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"17","articleId":"6773931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6773968,"authors":[{"name":"C.

These conditions ensure circular symmetry and absence of cross-polarization everywhere in the far field of an antenna, provided a suitable feed such as a corrugated horn is employed. The spherical wave radiated by the fundamental mode of such a feed has circular symmetry around the axis, and it is everywhere free of cross-polarization. An arbitrary sequence of N confocal reflectors (hyperboloids, ellipsoids, paraboloids) is combined with such a feed. It is shown that it is always possible to ensure circular symmetry (and absence of cross-polarization) in the antenna far field by properly choosing the feed axis orientation. If the final reflector is a paraboloid, a simple geometrical procedure can be used. It is also shown that the asymmetry caused by an arbitrary number of reflections can always be eliminated by properly introducing an additional reflection. An application to the problem of producing a horizontal beam using a vertical feed is discussed. Two arrangements are described that may be useful for radio relay systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Offset multireflector antennas with perfect pattern symmetry and polarization discrimination","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1978.tb02171.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773953/06773968.pdf","startPage":"2663","endPage":"2684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1978.tb02171.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1978","displayDocTitle":"Offset multireflector antennas with perfect pattern symmetry and polarization discrimination","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 1978","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Offset multireflector antennas with perfect pattern symmetry and polarization discrimination","sourcePdf":"bstj5772663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019246S","chronDate":"Sept.  1978","isNumber":"6773953","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"39","articleId":"6773968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6773971,"authors":[{"name":"Debasis Mitra","firstName":"Debasis","lastName":"Mitra"},{"name":"B.

The arithmetics we develop for the digital processing are useful as well in the implementation of previously existing schemes for adaptive quantization. Two objectives are stressed here: (i) The system must be robust in the presence of noise in the transmission channel which causes the synchronization between quantizer adaptations in the transmitter and receiver to deteriorate. (ii) It must also minimize the complexity of the digital realization. In addition to the above objectives, we require, of course, good fidelity of the processed speech waveform. The problem of synchronization in digital implementations where the constraint of finite precision arithmetic exists has not been addressed previously. We begin by examining an existing, idealized adaptation algorithm which contains a leakage parameter for the purpose of deriving robustness. We prove that, to provide the necessary synchronization capability without impairing the quality of speech reproduction, it is necessary to use a minimum, unexpectedly large, number of bits in the machine words and, additionally, to carefully specify the internal arithmetic, as is done here. The new scheme that we propose here uses an order of magnitude less memory in an ROM-based implementation. The key innovations responsible for the improvement are: (i) modification of the adaptation algorithm to one where leakage is interleaved infrequently but at regular intervals into the adaptation recursion; (ii) a specification of the internal machine arithmetic that guarantees synchronization in the presence of channel errors. A detailed theoretical analysis of the statistical behavior of the proposed system for random inputs is given here. Results of a simulation of a realistic 16-level adaptive quantizer are reported.","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773953/06773971.pdf","startPage":"2727","endPage":"2763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive PCM system designed for noisy channels and digital implementations","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1978.tb02174.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1978.tb02174.x","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773971/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1978","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive PCM system designed for noisy channels and digital implementations","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 1978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive PCM system designed for noisy channels and digital implementations","sourcePdf":"bstj5772727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017534S","chronDate":"Sept.  1978","isNumber":"6773953","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6773971","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6773985,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Thus, a user is unable to easily decide on the (approximate or exact) filter order required to meet his design specifications and must resort to tables or trial and error procedures. In this paper, such a set of design rules is given. In the case of very narrow bandwidth or very wide bandwidth filters, analytic relations between the filter parameters can be readily obtained. In all other cases, exceedingly good linear and nonlinear fits to the data can be obtained over somewhat restricted ranges of the parameters. These fitting procedures lead to a practical set of simple design rules for estimating filter order from the desired specifications.","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773984/06773985.pdf","startPage":"769","endPage":"799","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb01990.x","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb01990.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6773985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical design rules for optimum finite impulse response low-pass digital filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773985/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1973","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1973","displayDocTitle":"Practical design rules for optimum finite impulse response low-pass digital filters","volume":"52","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1973","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical design rules for optimum finite impulse response low-pass digital filters","sourcePdf":"bstj526769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052614S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1973","isNumber":"6773984","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"112","articleId":"6773985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6773990,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This modulation technique may be regarded as the placing of a discrete number of signal points in two dimensions. Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and combined amplitude and phase modulation (AM-PM) are two familiar examples of this signaling format. Subject to a peak or average power constraint, the selection of the signal coordinates is done so as to minimize the probability of error. In the design of high-speed data communication systems this problem becomes one of great practical significance since the dense packing of signal points reduces the margin against Gaussian noise. Phase jitter, which tends to perturb the angular location of the transmitted signal point, further degrades the error rate. Previous investigations have considered the signal evaluation and design problem in the presence of Gaussian noise alone and within the framework of a particular structure, such as conventional amplitude and phase modulation. We present techniques to evaluate and optimize the choice of a signal constellation in the presence of both Gaussian noise and carrier phase jitter. The performance of a number of currently used or proposed signal constellations are compared. The evaluation and the optimization are based upon a perturbation analysis of the probability density of the received signal given the transmitted signal. Laplace's asymptotic formula is used for the evaluation. Discretizing the signal space reduces the optimal signal design problem under a peak power constraint to a tractable mathematical programming problem. Our results indicate that in Gaussian noise alone an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of as much as 2 dB may be realized by using quadrature amplitude modulation instead of conventional amplitude and phase modulation. New modulation formats are proposed which perform very well in Gaussian noise and additionally are quite insensitive to moderate amounts of phase jitter.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb01997.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773984","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1973.tb01997.x","endPage":"965","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773984/06773992.pdf","startPage":"927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the selection of a two-dimensional signal constellation in the presence of phase jitter and Gaussian noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6773992/","displayDocTitle":"On the selection of a two-dimensional signal constellation in the presence of phase jitter and Gaussian noise","volume":"52","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1973","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the selection of a two-dimensional signal constellation in the presence of phase jitter and Gaussian noise","sourcePdf":"bstj526927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029011S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1973","isNumber":"6773984","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"59","articleId":"6773992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6774000,"authors":[{"name":"Herwig Kogelnik","firstName":"Herwig","lastName":"Kogelnik"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0005-8580"}],"articleNumber":"6774000","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":199,"citationCountPatent":63,"totalDownloads":3002},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774000","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01198.x","endPage":"2947","startPage":"2909","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773999/06774000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01198.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled wave theory for thick hologram gratings","abstract":"A coupled wave analysis is given of the Bragg diffraction of light by thick hologram gratings, which is analogous to Phariseau's treatment of acoustic gratings and to the \u201cdynamical\u201d theory of X-ray diffraction.

It is assumed that the source and channel are mutually independent but that correlations can exist among the components of each. The performance of the best linear system is then compared with the distortion shown by Shannon to be theoretically obtainable when no functional constraint is imposed at the modulator other than an energy constraint. Although the precise form of this optimum modulator is not known for general gaussian vector sources and channels, it is known to be nonlinear and to require arbitrarily long coding block lengths. However, it is a commonly held notion that when the source and channel dimensionalities are equal the optimum modulator is linear and requires a block length of only one. It is shown here that this belief is incorrect except in very particular situations which are described. Some relations between the optimum linear modulator-demodulator pair and Shannon's test channel are discussed, and an example is included which shows that the nonoptimality of linear devices can be quite small.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The optimum linear modulator for a Gaussian source used with a Gaussian channel","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01206.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6773999/06774008.pdf","startPage":"3075","endPage":"3089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1969.tb01206.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6773999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1969","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1969","displayDocTitle":"The optimum linear modulator for a Gaussian source used with a Gaussian channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 1969","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The optimum linear modulator for a Gaussian source used with a Gaussian channel","sourcePdf":"bstj4893075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020474S","chronDate":"Nov.  1969","isNumber":"6773999","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6774008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6774036,"authors":[{"name":"Robert W.

A method of computing bounds on the location of the solutions is given, and two iterative techniques are presented for computing the solutions. It is proved that the iterative techniques converge for a subclass of the equations which also includes equations describing certain active and nonreciprocal networks.

Particular attention is focused on the time intervals in which periodic data sequences are transmitted, such as during start-up or when an idle code is being transmitted. It is shown that the standard envelope-derived timing-recovery system may be significantly improved by zonal filtering of the received passband signal prior to forming the envelope. For phase-modulated systems, we discuss the limitations of the \u201cprecession\u201d technique employed for the purpose of providing a periodic timing wave when there is an input of short period. The advantages of using a phase-locked loop to filter the envelope instead of a narrow-band filter are also described. A study of scrambler operation has provided an extension of previous results concerning the relationship between the input and output period. It is shown that the output period of several scramblers connected in tandem does not necessarily double with the addition of a stage, and that if a particular stage does not lock up then no succeeding stage can lock up.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1975","volume":"54","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1975","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Timing recovery and scramblers in data transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing recovery and scramblers in data transmission","sourcePdf":"bstj543569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023212S","chronDate":"March  1975","isNumber":"6774088","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"16","articleId":"6774095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6774100,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this introductory article, the motivation for undertaking the development is pointed out, and the reasons for the choice of the various system parameters are discussed. The D1 Channel Bank, which was designed for exchange application, was the pioneer in digital channel banks. As a second generation channel bank developed for toll application, D2 could be expected to show significant advances over its predecessor. Of the many possible improvements, some would result in incompatibilities with portions of the existing plant. In such cases, engineering judgements were necessary to determine which of these were warranted by the performance improvements they allowed.

This paper discusses the capabilities of memories; the second paper discusses the capabilities of entire computing systems. Both present existence theorems analogous to the existence theorems of information theory. The fundamental result of information theory is that communication channels have a capacity, C, such that for all information rates less than C, arbitrarily reliable communication can be achieved. In analogy with this result, it is shown that each type of memory has an information storage capacity, C, such that for all memory redundancies greater than 1/C arbitrarily reliable information storage can be achieved. Since memory components malfunction in many different ways, two representative models for component malfunctions are considered. The first is based on the assumption that malfunctions of a particular component are statistically independent from one use to another. The second is based on the assumption that components fail permanently but that bad components are periodically replaced with good ones. In both cases, malfunctions in different components are assumed to be independent. For both models it is shown that there exist memories, constructed entirely from unreliable components of the assumed type, which have nonzero information storage capacities.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1968.tb01087.x","startPage":"2299","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6774135/06774147.pdf","endPage":"2337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1968.tb01087.x","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1968","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774147/","displayDocTitle":"Reliable information storage in memories designed from unreliable components","volume":"47","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable information storage in memories designed from unreliable components","sourcePdf":"bstj47102299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01092S","chronDate":"Dec.  1968","isNumber":"6774135","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"49","articleId":"6774147","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6774158,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Part I introduces the concept of burst distance and subsequently develops burst-correcting properties of a code relative to its burst distance. Part II discusses product codes for multiple-burst correction (MBC). The MBC properties of a product of two codes are derived from the properties of the original codes. The correction of spot errors is generalized to multiple-spot correction. Theorems are presented which strengthen the single-burst correcting (SBC) properties of some codes. A class of codes which corrects single, triple and quadruple bursts and 5 single errors is developed, and a decoding procedure is given. Finally, a code from the new class of MBC codes is compared with three other MBC codes.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01806.x","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6774178/06774193.pdf","startPage":"889","endPage":"909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01806.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Burst distance and multiple-burst correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1970","displayDocTitle":"Burst distance and multiple-burst correction","volume":"49","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1970","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Burst distance and multiple-burst correction","sourcePdf":"bstj495889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026997S","chronDate":"May-June  1970","isNumber":"6774178","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6774193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6774199,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The calculations of these error rates are difficult because of the non-gaussian nature of the noise in the optical detector. In this paper, statistical techniques are described which are useful for simulating tails of distributions. In particular, the importance-sampling procedure is used to modify the probability densities of the input values in a way that makes simulation possible. Application of this procedure gives more accurate results in reasonable computer times. The method is applied to the calculation of the error rate of a fiberguide repeater. Realistic examples are simulated. Results compare favorably with experimental measurements. The number of samples needed for simulation was reduced by five to six orders of magnitude. An alternative numerical solution to the problem is also developed.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1976.tb02908.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6774196/06774199.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1976.tb02908.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774196","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","startPage":"745","endPage":"766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1976","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical evaluation of the error rate of the fiberguide repeater using importance sampling","volume":"55","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1976","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1976","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical evaluation of the error rate of the fiberguide repeater using importance sampling","sourcePdf":"bstj556745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021117S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1976","isNumber":"6774196","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"44","articleId":"6774199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1976","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6774409,"authors":[{"name":"Dariush Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Canada"],"firstName":"Dariush","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"38274947200"},{"name":"Chadi Assi","affiliation":["Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Canada"],"firstName":"Chadi","lastName":"Assi","id":"37276207400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6774409","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":741},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Approximation methods","Distributed databases","Network topology","Approximation algorithms","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","telecommunication network routing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed method","compressive data gathering","wireless sensor network","energy efficient data aggregation","routing tree","forwarding tree","data encoding","decentralized method","DCDG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor networks","compressive data gathering"]}],"abstract":"Compressive data gathering (CDG) has recently emerged to provide energy efficient data aggregation in wireless sensor networks.

The first stage of the detection system characterizes a person's vertical state in individual depth image frames, and then segments on ground events from the vertical state time series obtained by tracking the person over time. The second stage uses an ensemble of decision trees to compute a confidence that a fall preceded on a ground event. Evaluation was conducted in the actual homes of older adults, using a combined nine years of continuous data collected in 13 apartments. The dataset includes 454 falls, 445 falls performed by trained stunt actors and nine naturally occurring resident falls. The extensive data collection allows for characterization of system performance under real-world conditions to a degree that has not been shown in other studies. Cross validation results are included for standing, sitting, and lying down positions, near (within 4 m) versus far fall locations, and occluded versus not occluded fallers. The method is compared against five state-of-the-art fall detection algorithms and significantly better results are achieved.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2014.2312180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/6999985/06774430.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2014.2312180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6999985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fall Detection in Homes of Older Adults Using the Microsoft Kinect","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6221020/6999985/6774430-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fall Detection in Homes of Older Adults Using the Microsoft Kinect","volume":"19","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14828946","pubMedId":"24733032","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774430/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774430/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-0931607"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000133","fundingName":"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality","grantNumber":"R01-HS018477"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Fall Detection in Homes of Older Adults Using the Microsoft Kinect","sourcePdf":"jbhi-stone-2312180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068725S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6999985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"293","xplore-issue":"6999985","articleId":"6774430","onlineDate":"17 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6774434,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Ling Ban","affiliation":["Institute of Electromagnetics and School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, P.

Aiming for robust design of the mass-produced surface-mounted permanent magnet motors, an analytical solution for the estimation of cogging torque is presented, which considers the magnet imperfections and the rotor eccentricity. In addition, the analytical solution is based on the exact subdomain model and accurate modified magnetization intensity, which takes magnet misplacement, remanence variation, magnetization direction error, pole-arc deviation, thickness error, and recoil permeability variation into consideration. Furthermore, the perturbation method is introduced into the model to describe the effect of rotor eccentricity. The spatial change of magnets and slots resulting from eccentricity is also considered in this paper, which effectively facilitates the calculation precision of cogging torque. Magnetic field distributions and cogging torque calculation by the proposed analytical solution are found to be consistent with the finite-element and experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774437/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14544308","htmlLink":"/document/6774437/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2014","externalId":"8201615","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analytical Solution for Cogging Torque in Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motors With Magnet Imperfections and Rotor Eccentricity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Solution for Cogging Torque in Surface-Mounted Permanent-Magnet Motors With Magnet Imperfections and Rotor Eccentricity","sourcePdf":"tmag-guo-2312179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066706S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6880871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6880871","articleId":"6774437","onlineDate":"17 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774443,"authors":[{"name":"Osman Salem","affiliation":["LIPADE Laboratory, University of Paris Descartes, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221020/6889048/6774443/6774443-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Osman Salem received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","He was a Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Telecom Bretagne, France, from 2006 to 2008.

The proposed framework performs sequential data analysis using a smart phone as a base station, and takes into account the constrained resources of the smart phone, such as processing power and storage capacity. The main objective is to raise alarms only when patients enter in an emergency situation, and to discard false alarms triggered by faulty measurements or ill-behaved sensors. The proposed approach is based on the Haar wavelet decomposition, nonseasonal Holt-Winters forecasting, and the Hampel filter for spatial analysis, and on for temporal analysis. Our objective is to reduce false alarms resulting from unreliable measurements and to reduce unnecessary healthcare intervention. We apply our proposed approach on real physiological dataset. Our experimental results prove the effectiveness of our approach in achieving good detection accuracy with a low false alarm rate. The simplicity and the processing speed of our proposed framework make it useful and efficient for real time diagnosis.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2014.2312214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/6889048/06774443.pdf","startPage":"1541","endPage":"1551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2014.2312214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6889048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Anomaly Detection in Wireless Body Area Networks for Reliable Healthcare Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774443/","displayDocTitle":"Online Anomaly Detection in Wireless Body Area Networks for Reliable Healthcare Monitoring","volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14564327","pubMedId":"25192567","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774443/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Anomaly Detection in Wireless Body Area Networks for Reliable Healthcare Monitoring","sourcePdf":"jbhi-salem-2312214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084747S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"6889048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6889048","articleId":"6774443","onlineDate":"17 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774445,"authors":[{"name":"Herminio Chavez-Roman","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (ESIME) Culhuac\u00e1n Unit, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Herminio","lastName":"Chavez-Roman","id":"37086633617"},{"name":"Volodymyr Ponomaryov","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (ESIME) Culhuac\u00e1n Unit, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Ponomaryov","id":"37268634100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6774445","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1467},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Interpolation","Discrete wavelet transforms","Hafnium","Wavelet domain","Image edge detection","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","edge detection","image representation","image resolution","interpolation","inverse transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse DWT","inverse discrete wavelet transform","sparse signal representation","sparse mixing weight calculation","high-frequency subband image","HF subband image","single LR input image","single low-resolution input image","SR image generation","edge extraction","wavelet domain mutual interpolation","super resolution image generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge extraction","interpolation","sparse mixing estimators","super resolution (SR)","wavelet domain"]},{"kwd":["Edge extraction","interpolation","sparse mixing estimators","super resolution (SR)","wavelet domain"]}],"abstract":"This letter addresses the problem of generating a super-resolution (SR) image from a single low-resolution (LR) input image in the wavelet domain. To achieve a sharper image, an intermediate stage for estimating the high-frequency (HF) subbands has been proposed.

Sparse mixing weights are calculated over blocks of coefficients in an image, which provides a sparse signal representation in the LR image.

Compared with conventional vision or 3-D sensors, the use of DVSs, which output asynchronous and sparse events in response to motion, eliminates the need to extract movements from sequences of video frames, and allows significantly faster and more energy-efficient processing. In addition, the rate of input events depends on the observed movements, and thus provides an additional cue for solving the gesture spotting problem, i.e., finding the onsets and offsets of gestures. We propose a postprocessing framework based on spiking neural networks that can process the events received from the DVSs in real time, and provides an architecture for future implementation in neuromorphic hardware devices. The motion trajectories of moving hands are detected by spatiotemporally correlating the stereoscopically verged asynchronous events from the DVSs by using leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. Adaptive thresholds of the LIF neurons achieve the segmentation of trajectories, which are then translated into discrete and finite feature vectors. The feature vectors are classified with hidden Markov models, using a separate Gaussian mixture model for spotting irrelevant transition gestures. The disparity information from stereovision is used to adapt LIF neuron parameters to achieve recognition invariant of the distance of the user to the sensor, and also helps to filter out movements in the background of the user. Exploiting the high dynamic range of DVSs, furthermore, allows gesture recognition over a 60-dB range of scene illuminance. The system achieves recognition rates well over 90% under a variety of variable conditions with static and dynamic backgrounds with na\u00efve users.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2308551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6960135/06774446.pdf","startPage":"2250","endPage":"2263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2308551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Gesture Interface Based on Event-Driven Processing From Stereo Silicon Retinas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774446/","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Gesture Interface Based on Event-Driven Processing From Stereo Silicon Retinas","volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14759087","pubMedId":"25420246","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774446/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Gesture Interface Based on Event-Driven Processing From Stereo Silicon Retinas","sourcePdf":"tnnls-lee-2308551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073829S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6960135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6960135","articleId":"6774446","onlineDate":"17 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774457,"authors":[{"name":"Mine Alsan","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Mine Alsan received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2007.

By constructing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and using the characteristic function technique, passivity conditions are cast in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be checked numerically using an LMI toolbox. Based on these conditions, two procedures for designing passification controllers are proposed, which guarantee that MRNNs with time-varying delays are passive.

The proposed models are extensions of the single-input single-output generalized memory polynomial model. Three types of crosstalk effects were studied and characterized as linear, nonlinear, and nonlinear & linear crosstalk. A comparative study was performed with previously published models for the linearization of crosstalk in a nonlinear 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO transmitter. The experiments indicate that, depending on the type of crosstalk, the selection of the correct model in the transmitter is necessary for behavioral modeling and sufficient DPD performance. The effects of coherent and partially noncoherent signal generation on the performance of DPD were also studied. For crosstalk levels of -30 dB, the difference in the normalized mean square error and adjacent channel power ratio was found to be 3-4 dB between coherent and partially noncoherent signal generation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6782343/06774462.pdf","startPage":"810","endPage":"823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2014.2309932","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2014.2309932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavioral Modeling and Linearization of Crosstalk and Memory Effects in RF MIMO Transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","MIMO","Transmitters","Kernel","Polynomials","Radio frequency","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","distortion","MIMO communication","radiofrequency power amplifiers","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioral modeling","memory effects","digital pre-distortion","RF MIMO transmitters","nonlinear 2 \u00d7 2 multiple-input multiple-output transmitters","single-input single-output generalized memory polynomial model","crosstalk effects","DPD performance","crosstalk levels","normalized mean square error","adjacent channel power ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Behavioral modeling","digital pre-distortion (DPD)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","nonlinear and linear crosstalk","power amplifiers (PAs)","RF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Behavioral Modeling and Linearization of Crosstalk and Memory Effects in RF MIMO Transmitters","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6774462/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14209877","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2014","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Behavioral Modeling and Linearization of Crosstalk and Memory Effects in RF MIMO Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tmtt-amin-2309932-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111785S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6782343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6782343","articleId":"6774462","onlineDate":"17 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774463,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Mohsenian-Rad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6894249/6774463/6774463-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamed Mohsenian-Rad (S'04\u2013M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia.

By eliminating unnecessary conversion stages, DC distribution systems can enable seamless integration of natively DC devices such as photovoltaic cells and batteries. Moreover, DC technologies can overcome several disadvantages of alternating current (AC) distribution systems, such as synchronization requirements and reactive power compensation. Therefore, in this paper, the first steps are taken towards designing demand response programs for DC distribution networks. The idea is to adjust the internal parameters of power electronics loads to ensure reliable and efficient operation of the DC distribution system. In this regard, first, an optimization-based foundation is proposed for demand response in DC distribution networks in presence of distributed generators. Then, the formulated problem is solved using both centralized and decentralized approaches, where the latter requires devising a pricing mechanism. Finally, simulation results are presented to assess the performance and to gain insights into the proposed demand-response paradigm.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2014.2308514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6894249/06774463.pdf","startPage":"2626","endPage":"2634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2308514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6894249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Building an Optimal Demand Response Framework for DC Distribution Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards Building an Optimal Demand Response Framework for DC Distribution Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774463/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14580781","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Building an Optimal Demand Response Framework for DC Distribution Networks","sourcePdf":"tsg-mohsenianrad-2308514-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075478S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6894249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6894249","articleId":"6774463","onlineDate":"17 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6774466,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Belfast, U.K."],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38241823200"},{"name":"George Goussetis","affiliation":["Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Goussetis","id":"37281216300"},{"name":"Laurence Richard","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Belfast, U.K."],"firstName":"Laurence","lastName":"Richard","id":"37606573600"},{"name":"Guochi Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Belfast, U.K."],"firstName":"Guochi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37533469700"},{"name":"Vincent Fusco","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology (ECIT), Belfast, U.K."],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Fusco","id":"37276686900"},{"name":"Franz Dielacher","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies AG, Villa, Austria"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Dielacher","id":"37376937500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6774466","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1336},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"The implementation of a dipole antenna co-designed and monolithically integrated with a low noise amplifier (LNA) on low resistivity Si substrate (20 \u03a9\u00b7cm) manufactured in 0.35 \u03bcm commercial SiGe HBT process with f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n/f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n of 170 GHz and 250 GHz is investigated theoretically and experimentally.

Analytical techniques based on perturbation theory have been proposed in order to overcome the need for long fixed-point simulation. However, these techniques are not applicable in the presence of certain operations classified as un-smooth operations. In such circumstances, fixed-point simulation should be used. In this paper, an algorithm detailing the hybrid technique which makes use of an analytical accuracy evaluation technique used to accelerate fixed-point simulation is presented. This technique is applicable to signal processing systems with both feed-forward and feedback interconnect topology between its operations. The acceleration obtained as a result of applications of the proposed technique is consistent with fixed-point simulation, while reducing the time taken for fixed-point simulation by several orders of magnitude.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6774487/06774536.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2292510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2013.2292510","startPage":"599","endPage":"612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated Performance Evaluation of Fixed-Point Systems With Un-Smooth Operations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774536/","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated Performance Evaluation of Fixed-Point Systems With Un-Smooth Operations","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774536/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"14180588","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated Performance Evaluation of Fixed-Point Systems With Un-Smooth Operations","sourcePdf":"tcad-parashar-2292510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118061S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6774487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6774487","articleId":"6774536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6774539,"authors":[{"name":"Tomislav Dragicevic","affiliation":["Aalborg University, Denmark"],"bio":{"p":["Tomislav Dragic\u02c7evic\u00b4 (tdr@et.aau.dk) is a postdoctoral researcher at Aalborg University, Denmark."]},"firstName":"Tomislav","lastName":"Dragicevic","id":"37073364500"},{"name":"Juan C.

This tendency is powered by the outburst of various electronic loads and, at the same time, the struggle to meet the lofty goals for the sharing of renewable energy sources (RESs) in satisfying total demand. RESs operate either natively at dc or have a dc link in the heart of their power electronic interface, whereas the end-point connection of electronic loads, batteries, and fuel cells is exclusively dc. Therefore, merging these devices into dedicated dc distribution architectures through corresponding dc?dc converters is an attractive option not only in terms of enhancing efficiency because of reduction of conversion steps but also for realizing power quality independence from the utility mains. These kinds of systems generally provide improved reliability in comparison to their alternating current (ac) counterparts since the number of active elements in dc?dc power electronic devices is smaller than in dc-ac converters. Control design in dc systems is also significantly simpler since there are no reactive and harmonic power flows or problems with synchronization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774539/","volume":"2","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6774539/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14180683","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Advanced LVDC Electrical Power Architectures and Microgrids: A step toward a new generation of power distribution networks.","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced LVDC Electrical Power Architectures and Microgrids: A step toward a new generation of power distribution networks.","sourcePdf":"02mele01-dragicevic-2297033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047384S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6508996","isNumber":"6774513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6508996","citationCount":"204","xplore-issue":"6774513","articleId":"6774539","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6774560,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Song","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6774487/6774560/6774560-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Song received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in microelectronics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006 and 2013, respectively, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.","From 2012 to 2013, he was a Project Officer with the VIRTUS IC Design Center of Excellence, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, where he was a member of the NTU CMOS Emerging Technology group.

This paper introduces an analog verification for SRAM dynamic stability under threshold-voltage variations. A zonotope-based reachability analysis by the backward Euler method is deployed for SRAM dynamic stability in state space with consideration of SRAM nonlinear dynamics. It can simultaneously consider multiple SRAM variation sources without multiple repeated computations. What is more, sensitivity analysis is developed for zonotope to optimize SRAM designs departing from unsafe regions by simultaneously tuning multiple SRAM device parameters. In addition, compared to the SRAM optimization by single-parameter small-signal sensitivity, the proposed method can converge faster with higher accuracy. As shown by numerical experiments, the proposed optimization method can achieve 600\u00d7 speedup on average when compared to the repeated Monte Carlo simulations under the similar accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774560/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774560/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14180579","volume":"33","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reachability-Based Robustness Verification and Optimization of SRAM Dynamic Stability Under Process Variations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reachability-Based Robustness Verification and Optimization of SRAM Dynamic Stability Under Process Variations","sourcePdf":"tcad-yu-2304704-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129046S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6774487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6774487","articleId":"6774560","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6774582,"authors":[{"name":"Gintar\u0117 Sukarevi\u010dien\u0117","affiliation":["Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuania"],"firstName":"Gintar\u0117","lastName":"Sukarevi\u010dien\u0117","id":"38574230100"},{"name":"Vladislav V.

Rate-adaptive streaming technologies, such as the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard, reinforces this problem in the core CDN infrastructure since delivering one video means delivering multiple representations for an aggregated bit-rate that is commonly over 10 Mbps. In this paper, we explore better trade-offs between CDN infrastructure cost and Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end-users for live broadcast video streaming applications. We consider in particular underprovisioned CDN networks, our goal being to maximize the QoE for the population of heterogeneous end-users despite the lack of resources in the intermediate CDN equipments. We show that previous theoretical models based on elastic bit-rates do not fit for this context. We propose a user-centric discretized streaming model where the satisfaction of end-users is related to the context and where a stream has to be either delivered in its entirety, or not delivered at all. We first formulate an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that achieves the optimal delivery through a multi-tree delivery overlay. The evaluation of the ILP shows the benefits of this model. We then design a practical system by revisiting the three main algorithms implemented in CDN: user-to-server assignment, content placement and content delivery. At last, we use a realistic trace-driven large-scale simulator to study the performances of our system. In particular, we show that the population of users is reasonably well served (three quarters of the population do not experience degradation) even when the CDN infrastructure experiences a severe underprovisioning (less than half of the required infrastructure).","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.140404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6774585/06774591.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.140404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774585","startPage":"706","endPage":"718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Delivery of Rate-Adaptive Streams in Underprovisioned Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Delivery of Rate-Adaptive Streams in Underprovisioned Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14180609","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6774591/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Delivery of Rate-Adaptive Streams in Underprovisioned Networks","sourcePdf":"706jsac0414liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086449S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6774585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6774585","articleId":"6774591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6774592,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Li","affiliation":["San Jose, Cisco Systems, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6774585/6774592/6774592-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi Li is with the Video and Collaboration Group at Cisco Systems.

First, by using HTTP/TCP, it leverages network-friendly TCP to achieve both firewall/NAT traversal and bandwidth sharing. Second, by pre-encoding and storing the video in a number of discrete rate levels, it introduces video bitrate adaptivity in a scalable way so that the video encoding is excluded from the closed-loop adaptation. A conventional wisdom in HAS design is that since the TCP throughput observed by a client would indicate the available network bandwidth, it could be used as a reliable reference for video bitrate selection. We argue that this is no longer true when HAS becomes a substantial fraction of the total network traffic. We show that when multiple HAS clients compete at a network bottleneck, the discrete nature of the video bitrates results in difficulty for a client to correctly perceive its fair-share bandwidth. Through analysis and test bed experiments, we demonstrate that this fundamental limitation leads to video bitrate oscillation and other undesirable behaviors that negatively impact the video viewing experience. We therefore argue that it is necessary to design at the application layer using a \"probe and adapt\" principle for video bitrate adaptation (where \"probe\" refers to trial increment of the data rate, instead of sending auxiliary piggybacking traffic), which is akin, but also orthogonal to the transport-layer TCP congestion control. We present PANDA - a client-side rate adaptation algorithm for HAS - as a practical embodiment of this principle. Our test bed results show that compared to conventional algorithms, PANDA is able to reduce the instability of video bitrate selection by over 75% without increasing the risk of buffer underrun.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.140405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.140405","startPage":"719","endPage":"733","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6774585/06774592.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774585","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probe and Adapt: Rate Adaptation for HTTP Video Streaming At Scale","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Probe and Adapt: Rate Adaptation for HTTP Video Streaming At Scale","volume":"32","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14180604","publicationDate":"April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6774592/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probe and Adapt: Rate Adaptation for HTTP Video Streaming At Scale","sourcePdf":"719jsac0415li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122813S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6774585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"299","xplore-issue":"6774585","articleId":"6774592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6774596,"authors":[{"name":"Diogo Ferreira","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6774585/6774596/6774596-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Diogo Ferreira is 4th year student of the PhD Program in Telecommunications MAP- Tele, from the Universidade do Porto and the Instituto de Telecomunicac\u00f5es.

The resulting technical challenges are particularly stringent in crowded spaces, where the density of users far exceeds the ability to deploy cellular base stations or WiFi infrastructure in a cost effective way. To address this problem, we present a reliable and scalable live streaming solution based on wireless multicast with real-time network coding. At the core of our approach is a timely delivery scheme that uses a minimum amount of feedback from the receivers to generate coded repair packets that are simultaneously useful to a large number of users. Our protocol, which we implemented and tested in a real-world wireless testbed, differs from traditional wireless unicast and multicast schemes in that (a) the feedback messages of the users are treated jointly and (b) the repair mechanism considers both the playout deadlines of individual packets and the list of packets already received by the clients. In comparison with a standard video approach that sends an MPEG-2 encoded stream over 802.11 unicast links, our solution offers real-time guarantees for all users commensurate with the link quality and an 11x improvement in terms of bandwidth usage. A commercial version of the proposed solution shows a strong increase in the number of clients that can access video streams simultaneously over a single WiFi hotspot.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Packet loss","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Streaming media","Wireless communication","Unicast"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","network coding","real-time systems","video streaming","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time network coding","live streaming","hyper dense WiFi spaces","video over wireless networks","cellular base stations","WiFi infrastructure","real-world wireless testbed","feedback messages","standard video approach","802.11 unicast links","MPEG-2 encoded stream","video streams"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multimedia streaming","network coding","wireless multicast","multi-user feedback"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774596","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.140409","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6774585/06774596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.140409","startPage":"773","endPage":"781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Network Coding for Live Streaming in Hyper-Dense WiFi Spaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Network Coding for Live Streaming in Hyper-Dense WiFi Spaces","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774596/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","volume":"32","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6774596/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14180602","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Network Coding for Live Streaming in Hyper-Dense WiFi Spaces","sourcePdf":"773jsac0414ferreira.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06507S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6774585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6774585","articleId":"6774596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6774838,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad R.

Whereas the G-IDNC graph represents only doubtless combinable packets, the LG-IDNC graph represents also uncertain packet combinations, arising from lossy feedback events, when the expected decoding delay of XORing them among themselves or with other certain packets is lower than that expected when sending these packets separately. We compare the decoding delay performance of LG-IDNC and G-IDNC graphs through extensive simulations. Numerical results show that our new LG-IDNC graph formulation outperforms the G-IDNC graph formulation in all lossy feedback situations and achieves significant improvement in the decoding delay especially when the feedback erasure probability is higher than the packet erasure probability.","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2014.022814.140067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6839992/06774841.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2014.022814.140067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6839992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lossy Graph Model for Delay Reduction in Generalized Instantly Decodable Network Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774841/","displayDocTitle":"A Lossy Graph Model for Delay Reduction in Generalized Instantly Decodable Network Coding","volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14396410","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774841/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lossy Graph Model for Delay Reduction in Generalized Instantly Decodable Network Coding","sourcePdf":"281-wcl1406-douik.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054728S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6839992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6839992","articleId":"6774841","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6774842,"authors":[{"name":"Lifeng Wang","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085370451"},{"name":"Maged Elkashlan","affiliation":["Queen Mary University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Maged","lastName":"Elkashlan","id":"37269057400"},{"name":"Jing Huang","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Huang","id":"38558059000"},{"name":"Nghi H.

The power semiconductor switch dies are sandwiched between two symmetric substrates, providing planar electrical interconnections and insulation. Two minicoolers are directly bonded to the outside of these substrates, allowing double-sided, integrated cooling. The power switch dies are orientated in a face-up/face-down 3-D interconnection configuration to form a phase leg. The bonding areas between the dies and substrates, and the substrates and coolers are designed to use identical materials and are formed in one heating process. A special packaging process has been developed so that high-efficiency production can be implemented. Incorporating high-efficiency cooling and low-loss electrical interconnections allows dramatic improvements in systems' cost, and electrical conversion efficiency. These features are demonstrated in a planar bond-packaged prototype of a 200 A/1200 V phase-leg power module made of silicon (Si) insulated gate bipolar transistor and PiN diodes.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2014.2312292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/6868320/06774853.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2014.2312292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6868320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Phase-Leg Power Module Packaged With Optimized Planar Interconnections and Integrated Double-Sided Cooling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774853/","displayDocTitle":"A Phase-Leg Power Module Packaged With Optimized Planar Interconnections and Integrated Double-Sided Cooling","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14500727","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774853/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Advanced Power Electronics and Electric Motors Program"},{"fundingName":"DOE Vehicle Technologies Office through UT Battelle, LLC","grantNumber":"DE-AC05-00OR22725"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Phase-Leg Power Module Packaged With Optimized Planar Interconnections and Integrated Double-Sided Cooling","sourcePdf":"jestpe-liang-2312292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060525S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6868320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6868320","articleId":"6774853","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6774858,"authors":[{"name":"John A.

Han and Kobayashi proposed a receiving strategy, which performs a joint unique decoding of messages of interest along with a subset of messages, which are not of interest. It is now well-known that this provides an achievable region, which is, in general, larger than if the receiver treats all messages not of interest as noise. Nair and El Gamal and Chong, Motani, Garg, and El Gamal independently proposed a generalization called indirect or nonunique decoding where the receiver uses the codebook structure of the messages to uniquely decode only its messages of interest. Nonunique decoding has since been used in various scenarios. The main result in this paper is to provide an interpretation and a systematic proof technique for why nonunique decoding, in all known cases where it has been employed, can be replaced by a particularly designed joint unique decoding strategy, without any penalty from a rate region viewpoint.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774863/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14251120","volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6774863/","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Is Non-Unique Decoding Necessary?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is Non-Unique Decoding Necessary?","sourcePdf":"tit-saeedibidokhti-2312285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086682S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6774863","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774866,"authors":[{"name":"To-Po Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Graduate Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6802373/6774866/wang-2309682-small.gif","p":["To-Po Wang (S'05\u2013M'08) received Ph.D. degree from the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2007.","He joined the faculty of Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2009.

Therefore, correct lifetime estimation of wind power converter is crucial for the reliability improvement and also for cost reduction of wind power technology. Unfortunately, the existing lifetime estimation methods for the power electronic converter are not yet suitable in the wind power application, because the comprehensive mission profiles are not well specified and included. Consequently, a relative more advanced approach is proposed in this paper, which is based on the loading and strength analysis of devices and takes into account different time constants of the thermal behaviors in power converter. With the established methods for loading and lifetime estimation for power devices, more detailed information of the lifetime-related performance in wind power converter can be obtained.

In this paper, a gearshift controller is designed using a data-driven predictive control technique to improve the shift quality of vehicles with a dual-clutch transmission (DCT). It is directly obtained from the input-output data of a DCT model constructed by the commercial software AMESim. In order to obtain an offset-free control for the reference input, a predictor equation is gained with the incremental input and outputs. The conflicting control requirements of a short shift time and a small shift shock are taken into account in the optimal objective function by smoothly tracking a selected proper reference trajectory and limiting the change rate of the actuator. Moreover, due to physical characteristics, the constraints of the actuator are explicitly considered in the problem formulation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven predictive controller is tested in the AMESim simulation model of a DCT vehicle. Aiming to pursue a real-time improvement of the hardware computing speed for the data-driven predictive controller, a novel scheme for implementing the designed controller based on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is proposed. Moreover, a rapid prototyping platform based on an FPGA and dSPACE is introduced for testing and verifying the computational performance of the proposed controller. The experimental results show that the designed gearshift control algorithm for gearshift has better performance in real time, and the control performance can be guaranteed in a real-time environment.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2312312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6994311/06774885.pdf","startPage":"599","endPage":"610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2312312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6994311","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven Predictive Gearshift Control for Dual-Clutch Transmissions and FPGA Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774885/","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Predictive Gearshift Control for Dual-Clutch Transmissions and FPGA Implementation","volume":"62","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774885/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14819889","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61034001 and 61374046"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT1017"},{"fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"2012CB821202"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven Predictive Gearshift Control for Dual-Clutch Transmissions and FPGA Implementation","sourcePdf":"tie-lu-2312312-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098711S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6994311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6994311","articleId":"6774885","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774890,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221020/7053969/6774890/6774890-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhang received the Bachelor's and Master's degrees in computer science from the Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the doctoral degree in pattern recognition and intelligence system from the South China University of Technological, Guangzhou, China, in 2012.","He joined the College of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, in 2005 as a Lecturer.

In BAN-enabled ECG monitoring, the continuous monitoring entails the need of the sensor nodes to transmit a huge data to the sink node, which leads to excessive energy consumption. To reduce airtime over energy-hungry wireless links, this paper presents an energy-efficient compressed sensing (CS)-based approach for on-node ECG compression. At first, an algorithm called minimal mutual coherence pursuit is proposed to construct sparse binary measurement matrices, which can be used to encode the ECG signals with superior performance and extremely low complexity.

Experimental results on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database reveals that the proposed approach can obtain higher compression ratio than the state-of-the-art CS-based methods.

The effectiveness of the proposed feature descriptor is based on the nature of the Gabor filter magnitude that tends to obey the Gamma distribution. The statistical parameters of the Gabor magnitude are computed using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which is later utilized to construct the feature descriptor. Conventionally, the Gabor magnitude is simply modeled by using Gaussian distribution, and thus the image descriptor consists of mean, standard deviation, and skewness values of the Gabor filter magnitude. However, recent investigations found that the skewness parameter is not contributing towards class separation. Based on our observation, the Gamma distribution provides a better statistical fitting to represent the Gabor filter magnitude when compared to the Gaussian distribution. As documented in the experimental results, the proposed feature descriptor yields higher accuracy for vehicle verification when compared to the conventional schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

response power (SRP) algorithms have been shown to be among the most effective and robust ones in noisy environments for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. In broadband signal applications, the SRP methods typically perform their computations in the frequency-domain by applying a fast Fourier transform (FFT) on a signal portion, calculating the response power on each frequency bin, and subsequently fusing these estimates to obtain the final result. We introduce a frequency response incoherent fusion method based on a normalized arithmetic mean (NAM). Experiments are presented that rely on the SRP algorithms for the localization of motor vehicles in a noisy outdoor environment, focusing our discussion on performance differences with respect to different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and on spatial resolution issues for closely spaced sources. We demonstrate that the proposed fusion method provides higher resolution for the delay-and-sum SRP, and improved performances for minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) and multiple signal classification (MUSIC).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2311164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750780","startPage":"581","endPage":"585","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6750780/06774907.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incoherent Frequency Fusion for Broadband Steered Response Power Algorithms in Noisy Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Incoherent Frequency Fusion for Broadband Steered Response Power Algorithms in Noisy Environments","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14178869","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incoherent Frequency Fusion for Broadband Steered Response Power Algorithms in Noisy Environments","sourcePdf":"lsp-salvati-2311164-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032008S","chronDate":"May  2014","isNumber":"6750780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"24","articleId":"6774907","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6774911,"authors":[{"name":"George Mathew","affiliation":["LSI Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Mathew","id":"37279376700"},{"name":"Euiseok Hwang","affiliation":["LSI Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Euiseok","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37337952600"},{"name":"Jongseung Park","affiliation":["LSI Corporation, Allentown, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jongseung","lastName":"Park","id":"38548158300"},{"name":"Glen Garfunkel","affiliation":["Headway Technologies, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Glen","lastName":"Garfunkel","id":"37085424030"},{"name":"David Hu","affiliation":["Headway Technologies, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085406920"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6774911","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":644},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Joints","Signal to noise ratio","Thermal stability","Media","Magnetic recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disc drives","hard discs","magnetic recording","performance evaluation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["next generation hard disk drive","ARMR approach","array-reader-based magnetic recording approach","recording capacity enhancement","HDD","bit patterned media recording","BPMR","heat-assisted magnetic recording","HAMR","2D magnetic recording","array-reader-based readback","readback signal processing","offtrack performance evaluation","single-track detection capacity","cross-track position"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-D equalizer","2-D magnetic recording (TDMR)","array-reader","array-reader-based magnetic recording (ARMR)","hard disk drives (HDDs)","magnetic recording"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an array-reader-based magnetic recording (ARMR) approach for enhancing recording capacity in hard disk drives (HDDs).

As antennas become smaller and cheaper relative to front-ends, it becomes important to devise a reconfigurable adaptive antenna array (RAAA) strategy to yield high signal to noise and interference ratio using fewer antennas. This is achieved by selecting K from N antennas to minimize the Spatial Correlation Coefficient (SCC) between the desired signal and the interference. The lower bound of optimum SCC is formulated with two relaxation methods to give information about the suitable number of selected antennas K. A Correlation Measurement (CM) method is proposed to select the optimum subarray with K antennas, thereby reducing complexity. We carry out performance analysis and show that a 1/K\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-suboptimum solution can be guaranteed with arbitrary shaped arrays. Furthermore, a Difference of Convex Sets (DCS) method is proposed to select the optimum subarray with controlled quiescent pattern in order to reduce the effect of interference during the reconfiguration time. The utility of the proposed array reconfiguration for performance improvement without increasing the cost is demonstrated using both simulated and experimental data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6782402/06774934.pdf","startPage":"2385","endPage":"2396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2312332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2312332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Adaptive Array Beamforming by Antenna Selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Interference","Antennas","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Array signal processing","Global Positioning System","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","electromagnetic interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconilgurable adaptive array beamforming","reconfigurable adaptive antenna array","RAAA strategy","high signal to noise-and-interference ratio","spatial correlation coefficient minimization","SCC","correlation measurement method","CM method","arbitrary shaped arrays","difference of convex sets","DCS method","quiescent pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive array beamforming","antenna selection","convex optimization","correlation measurement","difference of convex sets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Adaptive Array Beamforming by Antenna Selection","volume":"62","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6774934/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14219744","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Adaptive Array Beamforming by Antenna Selection","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2312332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088289S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6782402","articleId":"6774934","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774937,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7036147/6774937/6774937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoming Chen (S\u201912) received the BS degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the PhD degree.

The state-of-the-art Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have numerous cores sharing the same memory, provide attractive memory bandwidth and compute capability, and support massive thread-level parallelism, so GPUs can potentially accelerate the sparse solver in circuit simulators. In this paper, an efficient GPU-based sparse solver for circuit problems is proposed. We develop a hybrid parallel LU factorization approach combining task-level and data-level parallelism on GPUs. Work partitioning, number of active thread groups, and memory access patterns are optimized based on the GPU architecture. Experiments show that the proposed LU factorization approach on NVIDIA GTX580 attains an average speedup of 7.02\u00d7 (geometric mean) compared with sequential PARDISO, and 1.55\u00d7 compared with 16-threaded PARDISO. We also investigate bottlenecks of the proposed approach by a parametric performance model. The performance of the sparse LU factorization on GPUs is constrained by the global memory bandwidth, so the performance can be further improved by future GPUs with larger memory bandwidth.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7036147/06774937.pdf","startPage":"786","endPage":"795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2312199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2312199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7036147","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-Accelerated Sparse LU Factorization for Circuit Simulation with Performance Modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Sparse matrices","Instruction sets","Integrated circuit modeling","Parallel processing","Virtual groups","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","graphics processing units","parallel programming","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU-accelerated sparse Lu factorization","graphics processing unit","performance modeling","SPICE-based circuit simulators","simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis","memory bandwidth","massive thread-level parallelism","GPU-based sparse solver","hybrid parallel Lu factorization approach","NVIDIA GTX580 GPU","sixteen-threaded PARDISO","sequential PARDISO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","parallel sparse LU factorization","circuit simulation","performance model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"GPU-Accelerated Sparse LU Factorization for Circuit Simulation with Performance Modeling","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6774937/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14915371","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-Accelerated Sparse LU Factorization for Circuit Simulation with Performance Modeling","sourcePdf":"tpds-chen-2312199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092331S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7036147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7036147","articleId":"6774937","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6774938,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6819102/6774938/xu-2311656-small.gif","p":["Qian Xu received the B.E. degree in optoelectronics engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","She is pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, specializing in image processing and analysis, with Arizona State University, Tempe.

Unfortunately, not only is it computationally more intensive as compared with other edge detection algorithms, but it also has a higher latency because it is based on frame-level statistics. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to implement the Canny algorithm at the block level without any loss in edge detection performance compared with the original frame-level Canny algorithm. Directly applying the original Canny algorithm at the block-level leads to excessive edges in smooth regions and to loss of significant edges in high-detailed regions since the original Canny computes the high and low thresholds based on the frame-level statistics. To solve this problem, we present a distributed Canny edge detection algorithm that adaptively computes the edge detection thresholds based on the block type and the local distribution of the gradients in the image block. In addition, the new algorithm uses a nonuniform gradient magnitude histogram to compute block-based hysteresis thresholds. The resulting block-based algorithm has a significantly reduced latency and can be easily integrated with other block-based image codecs. It is capable of supporting fast edge detection of images and videos with high resolutions, including full-HD since the latency is now a function of the block size instead of the frame size. In addition, quantitative conformance evaluations and subjective tests show that the edge detection performance of the proposed algorithm is better than the original frame-based algorithm, especially when noise is present in the images. Finally, this algorithm is implemented using a 32 computing engine architecture and is synthesized on the Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. The synthesized architecture takes only 0.721 ms (including the SRAM READ/WRITE time and the computation time) to detect edges of 512 \u00d7 512 images in the USC SIPI database when clocked at 100 MHz and is faster than existing FPGA and GPU implementations.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6819102/06774938.pdf","startPage":"2944","endPage":"2960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Canny Edge Detector: Algorithm and FPGA Implementation","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2311656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2311656","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774938/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Canny Edge Detector: Algorithm and FPGA Implementation","dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14348185","pubMedId":"24983098","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6774938/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Canny Edge Detector: Algorithm and FPGA Implementation","sourcePdf":"tip-karam-2311656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07722S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6819102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6819102","articleId":"6774938","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774950,"authors":[{"name":"Amr M.

Since wind farms are more often located far from the system conventional generation centers, local signals do not comprise enough content for damping inter-area oscillations. This paper presents a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based wide-area damping controller (WADC) for the DFIG wind farms. The proposed controller is designed with a centralized nature on the basis of latest technological development of wide-area measurement system (WAMS). Damping both inter-area and local oscillatory modes are intended in the design process. The most challenging deficiency against WAMS real-time applications is the variable communication latency which can deteriorate the system stability if not properly accounted for in the controller design process. The proposed WADC hence incorporates effective means to compensate for the destructive characteristics of WAMS delayed signals. The PSO technique is applied to normalize and optimize the parameters of WADC. A set of comprehensive case studies are conducted on a 16-bus six-machine test system and the obtained numerical evidences are thoroughly discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14682662","volume":"29","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6774970/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Toward Wide-Area Oscillation Control Through Doubly-Fed Induction Generator Wind Farms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Wide-Area Oscillation Control Through Doubly-Fed Induction Generator Wind Farms","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-aminifar-2309012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06925S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6926883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6926883","articleId":"6774970","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6774973,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The theoretical proof and the conditions for meeting the objective are derived and practically verified in a practical prototype. The key features of the magnetic design are to: 1) shift the current stress from the primary driving circuit to the relay resonator; and 2) generate a large relay current for maximizing magnetic coupling with the receiver coil for efficient power transfer. Consequently, the current rating and cost of the driving circuit can be reduced and the overall quality factor and system energy efficiency are improved. This approach utilizes the combined advantages of the maximum efficiency principle and the use of relay resonator to overcome the energy efficiency problem for applications with extended energy transfer distances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology for Making a Three-Coil Wireless Power Transfer System More Energy Efficient Than a Two-Coil Counterpart for Extended Transfer Distance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2312020","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6917239/06774973.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2312020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6917239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology for Making a Three-Coil Wireless Power Transfer System More Energy Efficient Than a Two-Coil Counterpart for Extended Transfer Distance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6774973/","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14648182","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology for Making a Three-Coil Wireless Power Transfer System More Energy Efficient Than a Two-Coil Counterpart for Extended Transfer Distance","sourcePdf":"tpel-hui-2312020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111346S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6917239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"6917239","articleId":"6774973","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6774977,"authors":[{"name":"Quansheng Xu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6832681/6774977/xu-2312288-small.gif","p":["\nQuansheng Xu received the B.S. degree from Hangzhou Dianzi University,\nHangzhou, China, in 2010.

In this paper, we propose a novel EE resource-allocation scheme for orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) networks, where both transmitter energy consumption and receiver energy consumption are considered. In addition, different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, including minimum-rate guarantee service and best effort service, are taken into account. The time slot, subcarrier (frequency), and power-allocation policies are jointly considered to optimize system EE. With all these considerations, the EE resource-allocation problem is formulated as a mixed combinatorial and nonconvex optimization problem, which is extremely difficult to solve. To reduce the computational complexity, we tackle this problem in three steps. First, for a given power allocation, we obtain the time-frequency resource unit (RU) allocation policy via binary quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (BQPSO) algorithm. Second, under the assumption of known RU allocation, we transform the original optimization problem into an equivalent concave optimization problem and obtain the optimal power-allocation policy through the Lagrange dual approach. Third, an iteration algorithm is developed to obtain the joint time-frequency power-resource-allocation strategy. We validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed scheme by extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2312288","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6832681/06774977.pdf","startPage":"2071","endPage":"2082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2312288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Services in OFDMA Downlink Networks: Systematic Perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774977/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Services in OFDMA Downlink Networks: Systematic Perspective","volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2014","accessionNumber":"14379488","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6774977/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61271182"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Young Scientists Research Fund","grantNumber":"61302080"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project","grantNumber":"YETP0432"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1065444"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Services in OFDMA Downlink Networks: Systematic Perspective","sourcePdf":"tvt-du-2312288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103963S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6774977","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774980,"authors":[{"name":"Bejoy N.

To assess the robustness and breakdown energy tolerance of JFETs under pulsed conditions, they must be evaluated for breakdown energy capability before failure. This is very important for circuit breaker applications due to the large voltage spikes induced during the opening of the circuit breaker while it still conducts substantial load current. These voltage spikes can drive the JFET into the breakdown voltage regime and may result in device failure if the energy dissipation is above the tolerance limit. To determine the maximum avalanche energy of the device under repetitive pulsed conditions, a N-ON SiC JFET with a nominal rating of 1200 V/13 A was driven into punchthrough breakdown using an unclamped inductive switching (UIS) circuit. The testing comprised of 4000 repetitive pulses at 25\u00b0C case temperature at a fixed gate voltage of -20 V. The drain current was increased after every 1000 pulses to increase the energy dissipated. The JFET was able to withstand 1000 pulses at a maximum energy dissipation value of 1160 mJ before failure. The JFET triode breakdown characteristics were analyzed after every 1000 pulses. The peak UIS energy of 1160 mJ corresponded to an energy density of 16.6 J/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n based on their active area.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/27/6932524/06774980.pdf","startPage":"2968","endPage":"2973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of SiC JFET Performance During Repetitive Pulsed Switching Into an Unclamped Inductive Load","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2014.2309273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6932524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2014.2309273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774980/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of SiC JFET Performance During Repetitive Pulsed Switching Into an Unclamped Inductive Load","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14686271","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6774980/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of SiC JFET Performance During Repetitive Pulsed Switching Into an Unclamped Inductive Load","sourcePdf":"tps-pushpakaran-2309273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062469S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"6932524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6932524","articleId":"6774980","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6774981,"authors":[{"name":"George Athanasiou","affiliation":["Automatic Control Lab, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7122959/6774981/6774981-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["George Athanasiou (S\u201905\u2013M\u201910) received the Diploma, M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Thessaly, Volos, Greece, in 2005, 2007, and 2010 respectively, all in electrical and computer engineering.","Currently, he is a Research Scientist with the Department of Automatic Control, Electrical Engineering School and ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.

However, the special characteristics of such a band pose major obstacles to the optimal utilization of the wireless resources, where the problem of efficient client association to access points (APs) is of vital importance. In this paper, the client association in 60-GHz wireless access networks is investigated. The AP utilization and the quality of the rapidly vanishing communication links are the control parameters. Because of the tricky nonconvex and combinatorial nature of the client association optimization problem, a novel solution method is developed to guarantee balanced and fair resource allocation. A new distributed, lightweight, and easy-to-implement association algorithm, based on Lagrangian duality theory and subgradient methods, is proposed. It is shown that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal, that is, the relative duality gap diminishes to zero as the number of clients increases .","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Client Association for Load Balancing and Fairness in Millimeter-Wave Wireless Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2014.2307918","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7122959/06774981.pdf","startPage":"836","endPage":"850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2014.2307918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7122959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Client Association for Load Balancing and Fairness in Millimeter-Wave Wireless Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6774981/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15201215","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Client Association for Load Balancing and Fairness in Millimeter-Wave Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-athanasiou-2307918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131929S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7122959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7122959","articleId":"6774981","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6774983,"authors":[{"name":"Zahid Ullah","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Zahid","lastName":"Ullah","id":"37320497100"},{"name":"Manish K.

Thus, can we use the benefits of SRAM by configuring it (with additional logic) to enable it to behave like TCAM? This brief proposes a novel memory architecture, named Z-TCAM, which emulates the TCAM functionality with SRAM. Z-TCAM logically partitions the classical TCAM table along columns and rows into hybrid TCAM subtables, which are then processed to map on their corresponding memory blocks. Two example designs for Z-TCAM of sizes 512 \u00d7 36 and 64 \u00d7 32 have been implemented on Xilinx Virtex-7 field-programmable gate array. The design of 64 \u00d7 32 Z-TCAM has also been implemented using OSUcells library for 0.18 \u03bcm technology, which confirms the physical and technical feasibility of Z-TCAM. Search latency for each design is three clock cycles. The detailed implementation results and power measurements for each design have been reported thoroughly.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2309350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2309350","startPage":"402","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7027264/06774983.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Z-TCAM: An SRAM-based Architecture for TCAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Z-TCAM: An SRAM-based Architecture for TCAM","volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14915122","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6774983/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region","grantNumber":"CityU 123612"},{"fundingName":"Croucher Startup Allowance"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Z-TCAM: An SRAM-based Architecture for TCAM","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-ullah-2309350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060582S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7027264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7027264","articleId":"6774983","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6774984,"authors":[{"name":"Hakim Ghazzai","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6949175/6774984/ghazz-2312380-small.gif","p":["\nHakim Ghazzai (S'12) was born in Tunisia.

The base station (BS) sleeping strategy has become a well-known technique to achieve energy savings by switching off redundant BSs mainly for lightly loaded networks. Moreover, introducing renewable energy as an alternative power source has become a real challenge among network operators. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem that aims to maximize the profit of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) cellular operators and to simultaneously minimize the CO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n emissions in green wireless cellular networks without affecting the desired quality of service (QoS). The BS sleeping strategy lends itself to an interesting implementation using several heuristic approaches, such as the genetic (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. In this paper, we propose GA-based and PSO-based methods that reduce the energy consumption of BSs by not only shutting down underutilized BSs but by optimizing the amounts of energy procured from different retailers (renewable energy and electricity retailers), as well. A comparison with another previously proposed algorithm is also carried out to evaluate the performance and the computational complexity of the employed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06774984.pdf","startPage":"4508","endPage":"4519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2312380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2312380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6774984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Smart Grid Energy Procurement for LTE Networks Using Evolutionary Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Interference","Optimization","Mobile communication","Resource management","Green products","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","computational complexity","energy conservation","evolutionary computation","genetic algorithms","Long Term Evolution","particle swarm optimisation","power consumption","quality of service","renewable energy sources","smart power grids","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart grid energy procurement optimization","LTE networks","evolutionary algorithms","energy efficiency","cellular networks","greenhouse gas emissions","base station sleeping strategy","energy savings","renewable energy","Long-Term Evolution","CO2 emissions minimization","QoS","quality of service","green wireless cellular networks","particle swarm optimization","PSO algorithm","genetic approach","energy consumption","computational complexity","network loading"]},{"kwd":["Base station (BS) sleeping strategy","energy efficiency","evolutionary algorithms","green network","smart grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6774984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Smart Grid Energy Procurement for LTE Networks Using Evolutionary Algorithms","volume":"63","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6774984/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14735183","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"6-001-2-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Smart Grid Energy Procurement for LTE Networks Using Evolutionary Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tvt-ghazzai-2312380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079803S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6774984","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6775008,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob Chakareski","affiliation":["University of Alabama"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6775008/6775008-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jacob Chakareski completed the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Worcester, MA, USA, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, and Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.","He is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Alabama.

We analyze the performance of our system and contrast its characteristics with dynamic content adaptation at the source and conventional streaming architectures, including scalable video. We numerically simulate the operation of all streaming systems under comparison and establish a close agreement between our analysis and the experimental findings.

We postulate that this new method allows for fully distributed resource management between cognitive radio devices. The presented framework is generic, however, we consider it for the application in OFDMA networks. Coopetition takes the best from cooperative and competitive problem formulation, and provides the opportunity to control the balance between fairness and spectral efficiency (SE) of resource allocation. Simulation results confirm that coopetition allows for efficient resource utilization, and may be used practically in wireless cognitive networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.031214.130451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6816514/06775010.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.031214.130451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816514","startPage":"1518","endPage":"1529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coopetition Methodology for Resource Sharing in Distributed OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coopetition Methodology for Resource Sharing in Distributed OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775010/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14301858","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6775010/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coopetition Methodology for Resource Sharing in Distributed OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1518-tc1405-marcin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077325S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6816514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6816514","articleId":"6775010","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775011,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liang","affiliation":["University of Southampton, School of ECS, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6775011/6775011-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Liang received her B.

The novelty of our PDA is that the PUs negotiate with the CUs concerning the specific amount of relaying and transmission time, the CU is granted, which the CU will either accept or decline. The CUs may serve as relay nodes for relaying the signal received from the PUs to their destinations, while both the PUs' and the CUs' minimum rate requirements are satisfied. This will reduce the required transmission power and/or increase the transmission rate of the PU. Our results show that the proposed scheme performs better than the benchmarker, despite its significantly lower overhead and complexity. Moreover, we show that the cooperative spectral access based on our PDA reaches an equilibrium, when it is repeated for a sufficiently long duration. These benefits are achieved, because the PUs are motivated to cooperate by the incentive of achieving a higher PU rate, whilst non-cooperation can be discouraged with the aid of a limited-duration punishment. Furthermore, we invoke an attractive practical adaptive Turbo Trellis Coded Modulation (ATTCM) scheme, which appropriately adjusts the code rate and the modulation mode according to the near-instantaneous channel conditions. It was found that the joint design of coding, modulation and user-cooperation may lead to significant mutual benefits for all the PUs and the CUs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.030214.130326","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06775011.pdf","startPage":"1188","endPage":"1200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.030214.130326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pragmatic Distributed Algorithm for Spectral Access in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775011/","displayDocTitle":"Pragmatic Distributed Algorithm for Spectral Access in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251290","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775011/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pragmatic Distributed Algorithm for Spectral Access in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1188-tc1404-liang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090021S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6775011","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775012,"authors":[{"name":"Moon-Gun Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6775012/6775012-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Moon-Gun Song received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic and electrical engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Gyeongbuk, Korea, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

In the protocol, the primary system employs a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). When the primary system retransmits the data signal, the secondary system serves as a relay for the retransmission of the primary system and simultaneously transmits its data signal. To efficiently accomplish the protocol, we analyze the average throughput of the primary and secondary systems by using the long-term average throughput (LAT). We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the LAT of the secondary system. The constraint of the optimization problem is that the LAT of the primary system with secondary system is not less than that of the primary system alone. Through the optimization problem, we obtain the closed-form solutions of the transmission rate of the secondary system and the fraction of the transmit power for relaying the primary system's data signal and transmitting the secondary system's data signal. Numerical results show that the primary system does not lose the average throughput, and rather achieves an additional throughput gain by adjusting the fraction of the transmit power of the secondary system.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.021714.130140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06775012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.021714.130140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","startPage":"1178","endPage":"1187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Adaptation and Power Allocation for Cognitive Radio Networks with HARQ-Based Primary System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rate Adaptation and Power Allocation for Cognitive Radio Networks with HARQ-Based Primary System","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251294","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6775012/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Adaptation and Power Allocation for Cognitive Radio Networks with HARQ-Based Primary System","sourcePdf":"1178-tc1404-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089754S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6775012","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775013,"authors":[{"name":"Sorina Dumitrescu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6803818/6775013/6775013-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sorina Dumitrescu (M'05-SM'13) received the B.

The first scenario is the classic unequal erasure protection (UEP) scheme using a successively refinable code (SRC) and Reed-Solomon codes. The second scenario is an improvement upon UEP by applying domain partitioning and permuted Reed-Solomon codes. The third scenario uses a finer partitioning and erasure correction via repetition codes. Additionally, the MD lattice vector quantizer and another recent MD scheme are considered in the comparison. The aforementioned MD schemes are compared in terms of the expected squared error asymptotically achievable as the rate R of a description approaches \u221e, assuming independent description losses. Our analysis reveals that the improvement of the second scenario upon the first one when R \u2192 \u221e can reach up to 1.68 dB, but it approaches 0 as the description loss rate p goes to 0 and L approaches \u221e. Additionally, we find that the first two schemes outperform the third one with an unbounded gain when R \u2192 \u221e, as p\u2192 0 or L \u2192 \u221e. Further, we show that the first three scenarios achieve unbounded improvements over the other two as R \u2192 \u221e and p \u2192 0. On the other hand, we point out that some of the results of our asymptotic analysis rely on strong assumptions and therefore an experimental validation is needed before applying them to practical situations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.022314.120896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6803818/06775013.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.022314.120896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803818","startPage":"1358","endPage":"1372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotical Analysis of Several Multiple Description Scenarios with L\u2265 3 Descriptions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotical Analysis of Several Multiple Description Scenarios with L\u2265 3 Descriptions","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775013/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251276","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6775013/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotical Analysis of Several Multiple Description Scenarios with L\u2265 3 Descriptions","sourcePdf":"1358-tc1404-sorina.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.225211S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6803818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6803818","articleId":"6775013","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775014,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos I.

Specifically, the system consists of m single-antenna sources, a relay node equipped with n\u2265 m receive antennas and a single photo-aperture transmitter, and one destination equipped with a single photo-detector. RF links are used for the simultaneous data transmission from multiple sources to the relay. The relay operates under the decode-and-forward protocol and utilizes the popular V-BLAST technique by successively decoding each user's transmitted stream. Two common norm-based orderings are adopted, i.e., the streams are decoded in an ascending or a descending order. After V-BLAST, the relay retransmits the decoded information to the destination via a point-to-point FSO link in m consecutive timeslots. Analytical expressions for the end-to-end outage probability and average symbol error probability of each user are derived, while closed-form asymptotic expressions are also presented. Capitalizing on the derived results, some engineering insights are manifested, such as the coding and diversity gain of each user, the impact of the pointing error displacement on the FSO link and the V-BLAST ordering effectiveness at the relay.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.022314.130762","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6816514/06775014.pdf","startPage":"1634","endPage":"1645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.022314.130762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Relaying over Mixed RF/FSO Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Relaying over Mixed RF/FSO Links","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775014/","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14301856","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775014/","volume":"62","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 March 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Relaying over Mixed RF/FSO Links","sourcePdf":"1634-tc1405-miridakis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150952S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6816514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6816514","articleId":"6775014","onlineDate":"18 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6775031,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Abdallah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Saeed Abdallah received his Bachelor's of Engineering degree in Computer and Communications Engineering from American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon in 2005, and his M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from McGill University, Montreal, Qc., Canada in 2008 and 2013, respectively.

While previous works have adopted a pilot-based approach, we propose a semi-blind approach that exploits both the transmitted pilots as well as the received data samples to improve the estimation performance. Our proposed semi-blind estimator is based on the Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML) criterion which treats that data symbols as Gaussian-distributed nuisance parameters. The GML estimates are obtained using an iterative quasi-Newton method. To assist in the estimation of the individual channels, we adopt a superimposed training strategy at the relay. We design the pilot vectors of the terminals and the relay to optimize the estimation performance. Furthermore, we derive the semi-blind and pilot-based Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) to use as performance benchmarks. Finally, we use simulation studies to show that the proposed method provides substantial improvements in estimation accuracy over the conventional pilot-based estimation and that it approaches the semi-blind CRB as SNR increases. These improvements are possible using only a limited number of OFDM data blocks, which demonstrates the practicality of the semi-blind approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6814382/06775031.pdf","startPage":"2468","endPage":"2467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.031714.130348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031714.130348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Blind Channel Estimation with Superimposed Training for OFDM-Based AF Two-Way Relaying","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Vectors","Estimation","Relays","OFDM","Training","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel estimation","Gaussian distribution","maximum likelihood estimation","Newton method","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR","semi-blind CRB","pilot-based estimation","pilot-based Cramer-Rao bounds","pilot vectors","superimposed training strategy","iterative quasi-Newton method","Gaussian distributed nuisance parameter","data symbols","GML","Gaussian maximum likelihood","received data samples","amplify and forward communication","OFDM-based AF two way relay network","semiblind channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify and forward","Cramer-Rao bound","maximum likelihood","semi-blind channel estimation","superimposed training","two-way relays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Blind Channel Estimation with Superimposed Training for OFDM-Based AF Two-Way Relaying","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6775031/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299581","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Blind Channel Estimation with Superimposed Training for OFDM-Based AF Two-Way Relaying","sourcePdf":"2468-tw1405-saeed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134023S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6775031","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775033,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Yuan He","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6814382/6775033/6775033-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuanyuan He (S'08-M'12) received her B.

In this setting, a secondary network, consisting of a base-station with M transmit antennas and K single-antenna secondary users (SUs), is allowed to share the same spectrum with a primary user (PU), under an average total transmit power (ATTP) constraint and an average interference power (AIP) constraint at the PU receiver. We show that the ATTP constraint always remains active, and as the maximum ATTP P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">av</sub>\n\u2192 \u221e, the ergodic WSR approaches infinity similar to conventional non-CR networks. We propose a novel low-complexity suboptimal beamforming scheme termed \"Partially-Projected & Regularized Zero-Forcing Beamforming\" (PP-RZFBF) with a close-form beamformer, by combining the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) with the channel projection idea, to achieve a tradeoff between maximizing secondary throughput and suppressing secondary multiuser interference as well as the interference on PU. In order to analyze and optimize the performance of this scheme, we employ the large system analysis technique, in the limit as M and K approach infinity with a fixed ratio r=K\\M. This allows us to derive deterministic limiting approximations for the PP-RZFBF problem which enables us to determine asymptotically optimal beamformers for PP-RZFBF. In the large system limit, for the PP-RZFBF scheme, we also find that as P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">av</sub>\n\u2192 \u221e, the interference on PU caused by the secondary transmission is asymptotically removed. A special suboptimal beamforming scheme called \"CZFBF\" is also considered, which involves zero forcing all the interference, including the secondary multiuser interference as well as the interference imposed on PU. Various interesting comparisons between PP-RZFBF and CZFBF are provided. Numerical simulations illustrate that the asymptotically optimal beamformers for the PP-RZFBF scheme provide an excellent performance even for finite-sized systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum Rate Maximization for Cognitive MISO Broadcast Channels: Beamforming Design and Large Systems Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.031314.131097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6814382/06775033.pdf","startPage":"2383","endPage":"2401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031314.131097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Sum Rate Maximization for Cognitive MISO Broadcast Channels: Beamforming Design and Large Systems Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6775033/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299554","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum Rate Maximization for Cognitive MISO Broadcast Channels: Beamforming Design and Large Systems Analysis","sourcePdf":"2383-tw1405-yuan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126004S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6775033","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775036,"authors":[{"name":"Chang Li","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6814382/6775036/6775036-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chang Li (S'11) received the B.Eng. degree (First Class Hons.) in information and communication engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China, in 2010.

However, with more and more irregularly deployed base stations (BSs), it is becoming increasingly difficult to quantify the achievable network throughput or energy efficiency. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for downlink performance evaluation of small cell networks, based on a random spatial network model, where BSs and users are modeled as two independent spatial Poisson point processes. A new simple expression of the outage probability is derived, which is analytically tractable and is especially useful with multi-antenna transmissions. This new result is then applied to evaluate the network throughput and energy efficiency. It is analytically shown that deploying more BSs can always increase the network throughput, but the throughput will scale with the BS density first linearly, then logarithmically, and finally converge to a constant. On the other hand, increasing the number of BS antennas can decrease the outage probability exponentially, thus can always increase the network throughput. However, increasing the BS density or the number of transmit antennas will first increase and then decrease the energy efficiency if the non-transmission power or the circuit power consumption is less than certain thresholds, and the optimal BS density and the optimal number of BS antennas can be found. Otherwise, the energy efficiency will always decrease. Simulation results shall demonstrate that our conclusions based on the random network model are general and also hold in a regular grid-based model.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.031714.131020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031714.131020","startPage":"2505","endPage":"2517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6814382/06775036.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Small Cell Networks with Multi-Antenna Base Stations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Throughput and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Small Cell Networks with Multi-Antenna Base Stations","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299546","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6775036/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Small Cell Networks with Multi-Antenna Base Stations","sourcePdf":"2505-tw1405-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103189S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6775036","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6775037,"authors":[{"name":"Samira Niafar","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6814382/6775037/6775037-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Samira Niafar (S'14) received the B.

However, optimal resource allocation through FDPS is a complicated and challenging task when multiple input and multiple output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) technology is adopted. In this paper, we propose a new FDPS scheme for the 3GPP LTE downlink channels that optimally assigns time-frequency resources to users based on the proportional fairness metric. The proposed scheme jointly considers multiple system constraints imposed by the 3GPP LTE standard that arise in the MIMO mode selection and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection. Such scheduling problem is considered to be among the most difficult optimization problems. Our major contribution in this paper is that we model the FDPS problem as a unique binary linear programming problem and prove that the problem is totally unimodular. With the total unimodularity property, we are able to solve the complicated FDPS problem using efficient linear programming problem solvers. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the existing state-of-the-art MIMO proportional fair scheduling algorithms used in the FDPS problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6814382/06775037.pdf","startPage":"2412","endPage":"2421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.031314.130723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.031314.130723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimal Standard-Compliant MIMO Scheduler for LTE Downlink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Multiplexing","Downlink","Linear programming","Long Term Evolution","Scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal standard compliant MIMO scheduler","frequency domain packet scheduling","third generation partnership project","long term evolution system","multiple-input multiple-output","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA","3GPP LTE downlink channel","time-frequency resource","proportional fairness metric","MIMO mode selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE","frequency domain packet scheduling","total unimodularity","MIMO","proportional fairness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Optimal Standard-Compliant MIMO Scheduler for LTE Downlink","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6775037/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299556","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimal Standard-Compliant MIMO Scheduler for LTE Downlink","sourcePdf":"2412-tw1405-niafar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075841S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6775037","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775038,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6775038/6775038-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Li received the B.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, New Mexico, USA in 2009.

The wide frequency spectrum of interest is segmented into frequency sub-bands due to software and hardware limitations. These sub-bands can be non-contiguous, and each may contain an arbitrary number of channels from an arbitrary number of systems. It is assumed that the CR can only sense one sub-band at a time. Three sub-band selection policies are proposed to find spectrum opportunities taking into account realistic hardware reconfiguration energy consumptions and time delays. Two of the proposed policies rely on the individual channel Markov properties and the sub-band Markov properties, respectively. Although these two policies may achieve good performance, they rely on complete knowledge of RF environment dynamics and thus may become computationally demanding. The third sub-band selection policy based on Q-learning is proposed to circumvent this. Performance of the three policies are compared and discussed against a performance upper-bound of the optimal solution to the corresponding partially observable Markov decision process formulation. The suitability of the Q-learning technique is validated by showing that it achieves good performance through numerical results in both simulated and real measured RF environments.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031314.130900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","startPage":"2012","endPage":"2024","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06775038.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning-Aided Sub-Band Selection Algorithms for Spectrum Sensing in Wide-Band Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6775038/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning-Aided Sub-Band Selection Algorithms for Spectrum Sensing in Wide-Band Cognitive Radios","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252147","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning-Aided Sub-Band Selection Algorithms for Spectrum Sensing in Wide-Band Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"2012-tw1404-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101271S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6775038","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775039,"authors":[{"name":"Hongzhi Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6775039/6775039-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongzhi Guo (S'12) received the B.S. degree in Automation from Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

To this end, the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are envisioned to be deployed deep inside oil reservoirs to collect and report the physical and chemical information in real time. However, none of the existing wireless communication and networking technologies can support WSNs in oil reservoirs due to the very challenging environment and the extremely small device size. To address the problem, this paper proposes a new self-contained micro wireless sensor network framework based on the Magnetic Induction (MI) technique, which can enable the real-time and in-situ monitoring in oil reservoirs. Rigorous analytical models are developed to characterize the oil reservoir channel for both MI communication and energy transfer, which confirm the feasibility of the proposed self-contained sensor network framework. To enhance the system efficiency and reliability, high-permeability proppants are injected in the hydraulic fracture to increase mutual induction; while the tri-directional MI coil antenna is designed to achieve omnidirectional coverage.

The closed-form expression for the inductance of the ground via is provided in the case that two ground vias are arranged under the nonradiating edge of the AiP. The new expression takes account of the radius and length of the vias, the relative positions of vias, and the distances between via holes and the feeding point of the antenna. Based on the circuit model, the influences of vias on the performance of the AiP are analyzed. It is found that the bandwidth of the AiP can be effectively improved by properly arranging two via holes under the nonradiating edge of the antenna. Finally, an AiP with the center frequency of 5.12 GHz is realized, and a bandwidth of 400 MHz is obtained.

We further installed 1.15-km long fiber links in an accelerator building and measured the relative phase drift at the link outputs in a klystron gallery, which resulted in 6.6-fs and 31-fs rms timing drift maintained over 7 and 62 h, respectively. To achieve this performance, we combined a balanced optical cross-correlator (BOC)-based stabilized fiber link for remote timing transfer and an optical-microwave phase detector (OM-PD) for local optical-to-microwave synchronization. We identified the impact of power and polarization-state drift in the fiber link and amplitude-to-phase conversion in the OM-PD on the link stability. Based on this analysis, possible technical improvements enabling even higher timing precision and stability are identified.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6887381/06775256.pdf","startPage":"3742","endPage":"3748","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2312400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2312400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6887381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote Laser-Microwave Synchronization Over Kilometer-Scale Fiber Link With Few-Femtosecond Drift","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Masers","Synchronization","Optical fiber polarization","Fiber lasers","Phase measurement","Voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fibre lasers","microwave photonics","optical fibre polarisation","optical klystrons","optical links","optical modulation","phase modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote laser-microwave synchronization","kilometer-scale fiber link","few-femtosecond drift","mode-locked laser","microwave source","meter-to kilometer-scale fiber link","few-femtosecond RMS timing","overlapping Allan deviation","accelerator","klystron gallery","balanced optical cross-correlator","BOC-based stabilized fiber link","remote timing transfer","optical-microwave phase detector","OM-PD","local optical-to-microwave synchronization","polarization-state drift","amplitude-to-phase conversion","link stability","frequency 2.856 GHz","distance 610 m","time 2.7 fs","time 6.6 fs","time 31 fs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave photonics","noise measurement","optical pulses","phase locked loops","phase noise","radio link","timing jitter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Remote Laser-Microwave Synchronization Over Kilometer-Scale Fiber Link With Few-Femtosecond Drift","volume":"32","issue":"20","htmlLink":"/document/6775256/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14561020","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote Laser-Microwave Synchronization Over Kilometer-Scale Fiber Link With Few-Femtosecond Drift","sourcePdf":"jlt-kim-2312400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081869S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6887381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6887381","articleId":"6775256","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6775258,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Cupertino","affiliation":["Politecnico di Bari, 70126, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6949174/6775258/cuper-2312540-small.gif","p":["\nFrancesco Cupertino (M'08\u2013SM'12) received the Laurea degree and the\nPh.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.","From 1999 to 2000, he was with the PEMC research group, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K. Since July 2002,\nhe has been an Assistant Professor with the Politecnico di Bari.

The matching network in the low-band feed compensates for additional capacitance for the folded metal plate with a resonant length much less than 0.25 wavelength in the lower band (698-960 MHz) and enhances the antenna's impedance matching to achieve a wide lower band. The matching network in the high-band feed also enhances the antenna's impedance matching to achieve a wide higher band (1710-2690 MHz). In addition, the coupling gap in the high-band feed can reject the low-band frequency. Also, the matching network in the low-band (high-band) feed includes a bandpass circuit which can help reject the high-band (low-band) frequency. Good isolation between the two hybrid feeds can, hence, be obtained, which makes the antenna with simple structure and small size have good radiation performances in both lower and higher bands.

In our scheme, encryption of the downstream signal is obtained by applying exclusive or (xor) operation between optical network units' (ONUs') downstream signals and received upstream signals at the optical line terminal side. The upstream signals are used as secure keys for corresponding ONUs. Then the encrypted downstream signals are sent to the ONU sides, where the downstream signal can be retrieved by applying xor operation again between the encrypted downstream signal and the stored upstream signal. Since each ONU cannot obtain the upstream signals of other ONUs, only the ONU itself can recover its downstream signal from the encrypted downstream signal. Moreover, the secure key is dynamically changing along with the upstream signal, significantly improving the security of the downstream signal for the OFDM-PON system. A 5-Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation OFDM signal with xor-based encryption has been successfully implemented over a 25-km standard single-mode fiber. Experimental results verify that the encryption scheme can effectively prevent eavesdropping by malicious users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Encryption in OFDM-PON Employing Time-Variable Keys From ONUs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2311451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/6750774/06775279.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2311451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Encryption in OFDM-PON Employing Time-Variable Keys From ONUs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6775279/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7901006","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14178865","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Physical Layer Encryption in OFDM-PON Employing Time-Variable Keys From ONUs","sourcePdf":"jphot-cao-2311451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088136S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6750774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6750774","articleId":"6775279","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6775283,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Koohestani","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Laboratoire d'Electromagn\u00e9tisme et d'Acoustique, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Koohestani","id":"37542733900"},{"name":"Antonio A.

In this paper we investigate the power-to-phase coupling in two commercial high bandwidth P-I-N, near-IR photodetectors. We observe that a sudden change of the optical power induces a transient of the phase of the 20 GHz signal, at different time scales. The temperature rise of the photodetector junction is likely to be involved in this dynamical behaviour. The value of the bias voltage applied to the photodetector appears to control the size of the phase transients, as well as the optical power for which the slope of the amplitude-to-phase coupling cancels. The most efficient way to reduce amplitude to phase couplings consists in implementing optical demodulation, instead of electrical demodulation, of the microwave signal.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6887381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2312457","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6887381/06775285.pdf","startPage":"3759","endPage":"3767","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2312457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Measurement of a Microwave Optical Modulation: Characterisation and Reduction of Amplitude-to-Phase Conversion in 1.5 \u03bcm High Bandwidth Photodiodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Phase Measurement of a Microwave Optical Modulation: Characterisation and Reduction of Amplitude-to-Phase Conversion in 1.5 \u03bcm High Bandwidth Photodiodes","volume":"32","issue":"20","htmlLink":"/document/6775285/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14561012","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Measurement of a Microwave Optical Modulation: Characterisation and Reduction of Amplitude-to-Phase Conversion in 1.5 \u03bcm High Bandwidth Photodiodes","sourcePdf":"jlt-lintz-2312457-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068489S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6887381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6887381","articleId":"6775285","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6775286,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Chang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuan-Chang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37578271800"},{"name":"Tsung-Ming Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Ming","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37416047700"},{"name":"Ting-Chang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ting-Chang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37292029400"},{"name":"Kai-Huang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Tung-Fang Design University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Huang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37069474900"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38522621100"},{"name":"Zhi-Yang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhi-Yang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088714110"},{"name":"Jung-Hui Chen","affiliation":["Department of Chemistry, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Hui","lastName":"Chen","id":"38576482100"},{"name":"Tai-Fa Young","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Electro-Mechanical Engineering, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tai-Fa","lastName":"Young","id":"37562107300"},{"name":"Min-Chen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539622600"},{"name":"Tian-Jian Chu","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tian-Jian","lastName":"Chu","id":"38549647000"},{"name":"Syuan-Yong Huang","affiliation":["Department of Materials and Optoelectronic Science, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Syuan-Yong","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085584987"},{"name":"Yong-En Syu","affiliation":["Department of Physics, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yong-En","lastName":"Syu","id":"37705551900"},{"name":"Ding-Hua Bao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, School of Physics and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ding-Hua","lastName":"Bao","id":"37086628948"},{"name":"Simon M.

Then, a reliable filter with strict dissipativity is designed by solving a convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by standard numerical algorithms.

Accurately predicting the users' quality of experience (QoE) for rate-adaptive HTTP video streams is thus critical to achieve efficiency. An important aspect of understanding and modeling QoE is predicting the up-to-the-moment subjective quality of a video as it is played, which is difficult due to hysteresis effects and nonlinearities in human behavioral responses. This paper presents a Hammerstein-Wiener model for predicting the time-varying subjective quality (TVSQ) of rate-adaptive videos. To collect data for model parameterization and validation, a database of longer duration videos with time-varying distortions was built and the TVSQs of the videos were measured in a large-scale subjective study. The proposed method is able to reliably predict the TVSQ of rate adaptive videos. Since the Hammerstein-Wiener model has a very simple structure, the proposed method is suitable for online TVSQ prediction in HTTP-based streaming.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2312613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"2206","endPage":"2221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2312613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779706","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6779706/06775292.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Predictive models","Databases","Quality assessment","Video recording","Adaptation models","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","hypermedia","hysteresis","quality of experience","stochastic processes","time-varying systems","transport protocols","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypertext transfer protocol","HTTP video streams","rate adaptations","quality of experience","QoE","hysteresis effects","human behavioral responses","Hammerstein-Wiener model","time varying subjective quality","TVSQ","rate adaptive videos","time varying distortions"]},{"kwd":["QoE","HTTP-based streaming","time-varying subjective quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the Time\u2014Varying Subjective Quality of HTTP Video Streams With Rate Adaptations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775292/","volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6775292/","accessionNumber":"14219427","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"24723577","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the Time\u2014Varying Subjective Quality of HTTP Video Streams With Rate Adaptations","sourcePdf":"tip-heath-2312613-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094173S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6779706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6779706","articleId":"6775292","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6775293,"authors":[{"name":"Han Yuan","affiliation":["Laureate Institute for Brain Research, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37592390500"},{"name":"Bin He","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"He","id":"37332012000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"6775293","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":239,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4446},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"abstract":"Many studies over the past two decades have shown that people can use brain signals to convey their intent to a computer using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). BCI systems extract specific features of brain activity and translate them into control signals that drive an output. Recently, a category of BCIs that are built on the rhythmic activity recorded over the sensorimotor cortex, i.e., the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR), has attracted considerable attention among the BCIs that use noninvasive neural recordings, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG), and have demonstrated the capability of multidimensional prosthesis control. This paper reviews the current state and future perspectives of SMR-based BCI and its clinical applications, in particular focusing on the EEG SMR. The characteristic features of SMR from the human brain are described and their underlying neural sources are discussed. The functional components of SMR-based BCI, together with its current clinical applications, are reviewed. Finally, limitations of SMR-BCIs and future outlooks are also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6800026/06775293.pdf","startPage":"1425","endPage":"1435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2014.2312397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2014.2312397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces Using Sensorimotor Rhythms: Current State and Future Perspectives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Frequency modulation","Feature extraction","Electrodes","Three-dimensional displays","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","medical control systems","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","sensorimotor rhythms","brain signals","BCI systems","brain activity","control signals","rhythmic activity","sensorimotor cortex","noninvasive neural recordings","electroencephalography","multidimensional prosthesis control","EEG SMR","human brain","neural sources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI)","brain\u2013machine interface (BMI)","electroencephalography (EEG)","neural interface","sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Brain Waves","Brain-Computer Interfaces","Electrodes, Implanted","Electroencephalography","Feedback, Physiological","Humans","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Spinal Cord Diseases"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces Using Sensorimotor Rhythms: Current State and Future Perspectives","volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6775293/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14238924","pubMedId":"24759276","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces Using Sensorimotor Rhythms: Current State and Future Perspectives","sourcePdf":"tbme-he-2312397-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.222954S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6800026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"239","xplore-issue":"6800026","articleId":"6775293","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6775304,"authors":[{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6949175/6775304/li-2312416-small.gif","p":["\nLi Li received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems\nfrom Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2012.","He is currently with Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China.

To deal with this time-varying nature of available spectrum resource and achieve the ergodic sum capacity of all CRUs, we propose an optimal resource-allocation algorithm under the given constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve substantial capacity gains for CRUs over the traditional resource-allocation algorithm and maintain the statistical proportional rate constraints of all CRUs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06775304.pdf","startPage":"4334","endPage":"4343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2312416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2312416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Ergodic Sum Capacity of Fading Channels in OFDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Fading","OFDM","Optimization","Channel capacity","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cognitive radio","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodic sum capacity","fading channels","OFDMA","cognitive radio networks","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","CRN","cognitive radio users","primary users","cross-channel interference","long-term power transmission","long-term interference thresholds","statistical proportional fairness","spectrum resource","resource-allocation algorithm"]},{"kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","ergodic sum capacity","fading channels","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"On Ergodic Sum Capacity of Fading Channels in OFDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"63","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6775304/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14735170","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61071079 and 61300169"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Fund of the Sichuan Provincial Education Department","grantNumber":"14ZB0038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Ergodic Sum Capacity of Fading Channels in OFDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2312416-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075685S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6775304","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6775305,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Ismat Kadir","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Mohammad Ismat","lastName":"Kadir","id":"38543058300"},{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597300"},{"name":"KVS Hari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"KVS","lastName":"Hari","id":"37085406083"},{"name":"K.

Multiple-valued logic can decrease the average power required for level transitions and reduces the number of required interconnections, hence also reducing the impact of interconnections on overall energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a quaternary lookup table (LUT) structure, designed to replace or complement binary LUTs in field programmable gate arrays. The circuit is compatible with standard CMOS processes, with a single voltage supply and employing only simple voltagemode structures. A clock boosting technique is used to optimize the switches resistance and power consumption. The proposed implementation overcomes several limitations found in previous quaternary implementations published so far, such as the need for special features in the CMOS process or power-hungry current-mode cells. We present a full adder prototype based on the designed LUT, fabricated in a standard 130-nm CMOS technology, able to work at 100 MHz while consuming 122 \u03bcW. The experimental results demonstrate the correct quaternary operation and confirm the power efficiency of the proposed design.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2308302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027264","startPage":"306","endPage":"316","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7027264/06775312.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quaternary Logic Lookup Table in Standard CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6775312/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quaternary Logic Lookup Table in Standard CMOS","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14915130","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"2","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Funds through FCT-Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia","grantNumber":"PEst-OE/EEI/LA0021/2013 and QCell EXPL/EEI-ELC/1016/2012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quaternary Logic Lookup Table in Standard CMOS","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-brito-2308302-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114325S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7027264","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7027264","articleId":"6775312","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6775315,"authors":[{"name":"Petros Karamanakos","affiliation":["Institute for Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Petros Karamanakos (p.Karamanakos@ ieee.org) received his diploma and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

In many MPC problems, a long prediction horizon is required to ensure an adequate closed-loop performance in steady state and to avoid stability issues. However, the computational effort of solving the optimization problem underlying MPC problems with long prediction horizons is often very great, making the implementation of such schemes in real time a difficult and challenging task. To overcome this difficulty, three established methodologies are surveyed that yield long prediction horizons with a modest computational burden. Case studies are investigated to substantiate the merits of these schemes.

We propose a novel joint basis pursuit (JBP) algorithm that finds related sparse features in two modalities using conic programming and we integrate it into a two-step dictionary learning algorithm. The JBP differs from related convex algorithms because it finds joint sparsity models with different atoms and different coefficient values for intensity and depth. This is crucial for recovering generative models where the same sparse underlying causes (3D features) give rise to different signals (intensity and depth). We give a bound for recovery error of sparse coefficients obtained by JBP, and show numerically that JBP is superior to the group lasso algorithm. When applied to the Middlebury depth-intensity database, our learning algorithm converges to a set of related features, such as pairs of depth and intensity edges or image textures and depth slants. Finally, we show that JBP outperforms state of the art methods on depth inpainting for time-of-flight and Microsoft Kinect 3D data.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2312645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6779706/06775324.pdf","startPage":"2122","endPage":"2132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2312645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Joint Intensity-Depth Sparse Representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775324/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Joint Intensity-Depth Sparse Representations","volume":"23","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14219426","pubMedId":"24723574","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775324/","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Joint Intensity-Depth Sparse Representations","sourcePdf":"tip-tosic-2312645-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079714S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6779706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6779706","articleId":"6775324","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6775329,"authors":[{"name":"Rudrasis Chakraborty","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Sciences Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6990695/6775329/chakr-2308902-small.gif","p":["Rudrasis Chakraborty (S'11) received the bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India, and the Jadavpur University, Kolkata, respectively.","His current research interests include machine learning, dictionary learning, computer vision, and dimensionality reduction."]},"firstName":"Rudrasis","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37707308100"},{"name":"Nikhil R.

We explain how FSMLP can select essential features and discard derogatory and indifferent features. Such a method may pick up some useful but dependent (say correlated) features, all of which may not be needed. We then propose a general scheme for dealing with feature selection with \u201ccontrolled redundancy\u201d (CoR). The proposed scheme, named as FSMLP-CoR, can select features with a controlled redundancy both for classification and function approximation/prediction type problems. We have also proposed a new more effective training scheme named mFSMLP-CoR. The idea is general in nature and can be used with other learning schemes also. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms using several data sets including a synthetic data set. We also show that the selected features are adequate to solve the problem at hand. Here, we have considered a measure of linear dependency to control the redundancy. The use of nonlinear measures of dependency, such as mutual information, is straightforward. Here, there are some advantages of the proposed schemes. They do not require explicit evaluation of the feature subsets. Here, feature selection is integrated into designing of the decision-making system. Hence, it can look at all features together and pick up whatever is necessary. Our methods can account for possible nonlinear subtle interactions between features, as well as that between features, tools, and the problem being solved. They can also control the level of redundancy in the selected features. Of the two learning schemes, mFSMLP-CoR, not only improves the performance of the system, but also significantly reduces the dependency of the network's behavior on the initialization of connection weights.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2308902","startPage":"35","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6990695/06775329.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2308902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Selection Using a Neural Framework With Controlled Redundancy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Learning systems","Mutual information","Vectors","Correlation","Training data","Multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","feature selection","function approximation","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptron neural network","feature selection MLP","controlled redundancy","classification type problems","function approximation type problems","function prediction type problems","mFSMLP-CoR learning scheme","decision-making system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dimensionality reduction","feature selection","neural network","redundancy control."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Datasets as Topic","Decision Support Techniques","Humans","Learning","Neural Networks (Computer)","Perception"]},{"kwd":["Dimensionality reduction","feature selection","neural network","redundancy control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775329/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Feature Selection Using a Neural Framework With Controlled Redundancy","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6775329/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14811299","pubMedId":"25532154","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Selection Using a Neural Framework With Controlled Redundancy","sourcePdf":"tnnls-pal-2308902-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163591S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6990695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6990695","articleId":"6775329","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6775332,"authors":[{"name":"Kebin Yuan","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China","Beijing Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Rehabilitation Engineering, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6936399/6775332/6775332-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kebin Yuan (SM\u201913) received the Bachelor's degree in automation from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2010.

In this paper, we present a real-time fuzzy-logic-based terrain identification method with multisensor fusion. Five locomotion features, including the foot inclination angle at the first strike, the shank inclination angle at the first strike, foot strike sequence, the foot inclination angle at mid-stance, and the shank inclination angle at toe-off, are used to identify different terrains and terrain transitions. These features are measured by the fusion of two triaxis gyroscopes, two triaxis accelerometers, two force sensitive resistors, and a timer, which can be embedded into the prosthesis. Based on these features, a fuzzy-logic-based identification method is proposed to identify five terrains: level ground, stair ascent, stair descent, ramp ascent, and ramp descent. Moreover, a transition constraint function is developed to improve the identification performance. The execution time of the identification method is 0.79 ms \u00b1 0.02 ms (mean \u00b1 standard error of mean) and continuous terrain identification results show that the method can be operated online in real time. The average identification accuracy of 98.74% \u00b1 0.32% is obtained from experiments with six able-bodied and three amputee subjects during steady locomotion periods (no terrain transition). In locomotion transition periods, all the eight transitions we studied are correctly identified and the average identification delay is 9.06% \u00b1 3.46% of one gait cycle.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Foot","Sensors","Correlation","Prosthetics","Accuracy","Legged locomotion","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","fuzzy control","gait analysis","gyroscopes","identification","medical robotics","prosthetics","resistors","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisensor fusion","transtibial amputees","robotic transtibial prosthesis control","locomotion transitions","real-time fuzzy-logic-based terrain identification method","locomotion features","foot inclination angle","shank inclination angle","foot strike sequence","first-strike","mid-stance","toe-off","terrain transitions","feature measurement","triaxis gyroscopes","triaxis accelerometers","force sensitive resistors","timers","level ground","stair ascent","stair descent","ramp ascent","ramp descent","transition constraint function","identification performance improvement","execution time","standard mean error","average identification accuracy","able-bodied person","amputee person","steady locomotion periods","locomotion transition periods","average identification delay","gait cycle","to"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","locomotion transitions","multisensor fusion","terrain identification","transtibial prostheses"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2014.2309708","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/6936399/06775332.pdf","startPage":"618","endPage":"630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6936399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2014.2309708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-Logic-Based Terrain Identification with Multisensor Fusion for Transtibial Amputees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-Logic-Based Terrain Identification with Multisensor Fusion for Transtibial Amputees","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775332/","volume":"20","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775332/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14695907","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61005082 and Grant 61020106005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-Logic-Based Terrain Identification with Multisensor Fusion for Transtibial Amputees","sourcePdf":"tmech-wang-2309708-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084574S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6936399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6936399","articleId":"6775332","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6775334,"authors":[{"name":"Tri Kurniawan Wijaya","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6839066/6775334/6775334-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tri Kurniawan Wijaya (S'12) received the M.Sc. degree in computational logic from the Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany, and the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria, with distinction.

However, the analysis of baseline performance for residential customers has received less attention. In this paper, we analyze DR baselines for residential customers. Our analysis goes beyond accuracy and bias by understanding the impact of baselines on all stakeholders' profit. Using our customer models, we successfully show how customer participation changes depending on the incentive actually received. We found that, in general, bias is more relevant than accuracy for determining which baseline provides the highest profit to stakeholders. Consequently, this result provides a valuable insight into designing effective DR incentive schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When Bias Matters: An Economic Assessment of Demand Response Baselines for Residential Customers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2014.2309053","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6839066/06775334.pdf","startPage":"1755","endPage":"1763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2309053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6839066","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775334/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"When Bias Matters: An Economic Assessment of Demand Response Baselines for Residential Customers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6775334/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14396272","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"When Bias Matters: An Economic Assessment of Demand Response Baselines for Residential Customers","sourcePdf":"tsg-wijaya-2309053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06304S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6839066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6839066","articleId":"6775334","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6775335,"authors":[{"name":"Ulugbek S.

A novel method, called adaptive generalized approximate message passing (adaptive GAMP) is presented. It enables the joint learning of the statistics of the prior and measurement channel along with estimation of the unknown vector x. We prove that, for large i.i.d. Gaussian transform matrices, the asymptotic componentwise behavior of the adaptive GAMP is predicted by a simple set of scalar state evolution equations. In addition, we show that the adaptive GAMP yields asymptotically consistent parameter estimates, when a certain maximum-likelihood estimation can be performed in each step. This implies that the algorithm achieves a reconstruction quality equivalent to the oracle algorithm that knows the correct parameter values. Remarkably, this result applies to essentially arbitrary parametrizations of the unknown distributions, including nonlinear and non-Gaussian ones. The adaptive GAMP methodology thus provides a systematic, general and computationally efficient method applicable to a large range of linear-nonlinear models with provable guarantees.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2309005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6800061/06775335.pdf","startPage":"2969","endPage":"2985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2309005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate Message Passing With Consistent Parameter Estimation and Applications to Sparse Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775335/","displayDocTitle":"Approximate Message Passing With Consistent Parameter Estimation and Applications to Sparse Learning","volume":"60","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239001","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775335/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate Message Passing With Consistent Parameter Estimation and Applications to Sparse Learning","sourcePdf":"tit-kamilov-2309005-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169074S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6775335","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6775336,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Vazquez","affiliation":["Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Andaluc\u00c3\u00ada, ES"],"bio":{"p":["Sergio Vazquez (sergi@us.es) received his B.S, M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in industrial engineering from the University of Seville (US), Spain, in 2003, 2006, and 2010, respectively.

To address the challenge of impulse noise, a robust and efficient decoding scheme was devised for single-carrier convolutionally coded transmissions over memory impulse noise channels. By accommodating channel states but without relying on statistical knowledge of impulses, the Viterbi algorithm (VA) based on an expanded set of trellis states was employed to perform maximum-likelihood decoding. A detailed analysis of complexity was offered; the analytical results reinforced the efficiency of the proposed scheme compared with the traditional VA. The simulation results indicated that the proposed decoding scheme is compellingly robust: The bit error probability performance level attained using the proposed decoder is remarkably close to that of an optimal decoder, which uses impulse statistics; furthermore, the proposed decoder was superior to the alpha-penalty function decoder, which neglects the channel memory property and experiences an error floor under fairly general circumstances.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2312727","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06775344.pdf","startPage":"4344","endPage":"4356","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2312727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Decoding Scheme for Convolutionally Coded Transmission Through a Markov Gaussian Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Decoding Scheme for Convolutionally Coded Transmission Through a Markov Gaussian Channel","volume":"63","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6775344/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14735196","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC-101-2221-E-011-072-MY2, NSC 101-2221-E-011-069-MY3 and NSC 101-2221-E-011-073"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Decoding Scheme for Convolutionally Coded Transmission Through a Markov Gaussian Channel","sourcePdf":"tvt-tseng-2312727-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084939S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6775344","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6775362,"authors":[{"name":"Hector A.

There are two conventional spectrum sensing approaches: quiet and active. However, these conventional approaches have several problems. In quiet sensing, the quiet period degrades the SU capacity. With active sensing, the SU capacity is also degraded by the need for additional resource consumption and the mismatch in feedback information. In order to mitigate these problems, the structure of simultaneous PU sensing and data transmission is introduced. This structure is equipped with antenna isolation and self-interference cancellation in which the communication and the sensing radios are already assumed to be significantly isolated. This approach is designed so that the SU transmitter can sense PU signals and transmit data signals at the same time by dividing its spatial resources. Expanding on this work, we propose a concept of \"TranSensing\" which adaptively uses spatial resource according to the surrounding environments. To effectively use TranSensing, we propose a two-stage algorithm (TSA). Finally, the impact of residual interference on TranSensing is investigated. Simulation results show that TranSensing with TSA enhances the SU capacity over the conventional quiet or active sensing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06775369.pdf","startPage":"1948","endPage":"1959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.030614.130532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.030614.130532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Sensing and Transmission in Cognitive Radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Transmitting antennas","Data communication","Interference","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference suppression","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","white spectrum","secondary user","antenna isolation","self-interference cancellation","SU transmitter","PU signals","TranSensing","two-stage algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","correlated MIMO","spectrum sensing","simultaneous sensing and transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Sensing and Transmission in Cognitive Radio","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6775369/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252167","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Sensing and Transmission in Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"1948-tw1404-heo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134118S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6775369","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775370,"authors":[{"name":"Keivan Ronasi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6775370/6775370-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keivan Ronasi was born in Isfahan, Iran in 1981.

For a small number of users, determining the maximum possible degrees of freedom as well as the feasibility of interference alignment in MIMO systems is well studied. However, the issues of scheduling in systems employing interference alignment and serving a large number of users have received little attention so far. In this paper, we study the problem of joint scheduling, interference alignment, and packet admission control in MIMO wireless systems with the goal of maximizing system throughput subject to stability constraints. We formulate a stochastic network optimization problem and propose a scheduling and interference alignment (SIA) algorithm. In each time slot, SIA schedules some users among many competing ones to transmit data, and determines encoding and decoding matrices for the selected users. Packet admission control is performed in each time slot. In addition, we propose a heuristic semi-distributed algorithm (SDSIA), which has a lower computational complexity than the SIA algorithm. Via simulation, we evaluate the performance of SIA and SDSIA for different algorithm parameters and different numbers of users. We also compare the performance of SDSIA with other approaches which do not simultaneously exploit interference alignment and scheduling and find that the combination of these two techniques increases the achievable data rate dramatically.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput-Efficient Scheduling and Interference Alignment for MIMO Wireless Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.031314.122040","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06775370.pdf","startPage":"1779","endPage":"1789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031314.122040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775370/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Throughput-Efficient Scheduling and Interference Alignment for MIMO Wireless Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6775370/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252170","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput-Efficient Scheduling and Interference Alignment for MIMO Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"1779-tw1404-ronasi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116211S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6775370","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775372,"authors":[{"name":"Caijun Zhong","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Institute of Information and Communication Engineering, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6775372/6775372-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Caijun Zhong (S'07-M'10) received the B.S. degree in Information Engineering from the Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in Information Security in 2006, Ph.D. degree in Telecommunications in 2010, both from University College London, London, United Kingdom.

For MMSE receivers, exact closed-form expressions for the ergodic sum-rate of the system are derived. In addition, simplified expressions are obtained for the key parameters dictating the sum-rate performance of the system in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime (i.e., high SNR slope and power offset) and low SNR regime (i.e., minimum energy per information bit required to convey any positive rate and the wideband slope). While for ZF receivers, tight closed-form upper and lower bounds for the ergodic sum-rate of the system are derived. It is analytically proven that the ZF and MMSE receivers achieve the same sum rate performance in the high SNR regime. Moreover, for both MMSE and ZF receivers, the achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of Rayleigh-product MIMO channels is characterized. The findings suggest that a larger number of scatterers will improve the the performance of Rayleigh-product MIMO channels with linear receivers, and the ZF receivers achieve the same performance as the MMSE receivers in Rayleigh-product MIMO channels in the high SNR regime. Moreover, it is demonstrated that as long as the number of the scatterers is greater than the number of receive antennas, linear receivers achieve the optimal DMT.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06775372.pdf","startPage":"2270","endPage":"2281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.031314.131478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031314.131478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Rayleigh-Product MIMO Channels with Linear Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Wideband","Educational institutions","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiplexing","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh-product MIMO channels","linear minimum mean-square-error receiver","zero-forcing receivers","ZF receivers","MMSE receivers","exact closed-form expressions","ergodic sum-rate","sum-rate performance","high signal-to-noise ratio regime","SNR","closed-form upper bounds","lower bounds","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","optimal DMT","receive antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MMSE receiver","MIMO systems","Rayleigh-product channels","SUM-rate","ZF receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Rayleigh-Product MIMO Channels with Linear Receivers","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6775372/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252152","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Rayleigh-Product MIMO Channels with Linear Receivers","sourcePdf":"2270-tw1404-zhong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087998S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6775372","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6775375,"authors":[{"name":"Daiming Qu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Daiming","lastName":"Qu","id":"37274417000"},{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Li","id":"38184476700"},{"name":"Tao Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279307300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"6775375","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1034},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775375","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Parity check codes","Complexity theory","Block codes","Vectors","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","graph theory","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertible subset LDPC code","PAPR reduction","OFDM systems","low complexity code","low density parity check code","disjoint invertible subsets","error correction code","modified progressive edge growth construction algorithm","multicarrier communication","Tanner graphs","peak-to-average power ratio reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","low density parity-check codes (LDPC)","progressive edge-growth (PEG)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a new family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, called as invertible subset LDPC (IS-LDPC) code, for peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in OFDM systems with low complexity. An IS-LDPC code has a number of disjoint invertible subsets, and each invertible subset can be independently inverted to generate other valid codewords of the LDPC code. To construct IS-LDPC codes with good error-correcting performance, we propose a modified progressive edge-growth construction algorithm and verify its effectiveness by analyzing the constructed Tanner graphs. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the IS-LDPC codes exhibit good error-correcting performance and the proposed PAPR reduction scheme based on IS-LDPC codes significantly reduces the PAPR. Compared with the existing coding-based candidate generation schemes, the proposed scheme has a much lower searching complexity when the codeword is transmitted by multiple OFDM symbols.

Due to the increasing number of autonomous heterogeneous devices in future mobile networks, an efficient resource allocation scheme is required to maximize network throughput and achieve higher spectral efficiency. In this paper, performance of network-integrated D2D communication under channel uncertainties is investigated where D2D traffic is carried through relay nodes. Considering a multi-user and multi-relay network, we propose a robust distributed solution for resource allocation with a view to maximizing network sum-rate when the interference from other relay nodes and the link gains are uncertain. An optimization problem is formulated for allocating radio resources at the relays to maximize end-to-end rate as well as satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for cellular and D2D user equipments under total power constraint. Each of the uncertain parameters is modeled by a bounded distance between its estimated and bounded values. We show that the robust problem is convex and a gradient-aided dual decomposition algorithm is applied to allocate radio resources in a distributed manner. Finally, to reduce the cost of robustness defined as the reduction of achievable sum-rate, we utilize the chance constraint approach to achieve a trade-off between robustness and optimality. The numerical results show that there is a distance threshold beyond which relay-aided D2D communication significantly improves network performance when compared to direct communication between D2D peers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252187","htmlLink":"/document/6775376/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation Under Channel Uncertainties for Relay-Aided Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying LTE-A Cellular Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation Under Channel Uncertainties for Relay-Aided Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying LTE-A Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"2322-tw1404-hasan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.191217S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6775376","onlineDate":"19 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6775388,"authors":[{"name":"Tawan Panichcharoenrat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tawan","lastName":"Panichcharoenrat","id":"37085484209"},{"name":"Wilaiporn Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Wilaiporn","lastName":"Lee","id":"37291454600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1424-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1423-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6775388","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","convex programming","estimation theory","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iBLUE method","improved best linear unbiased estimation method","outer area","inner area","convex hull algorithm","time of arrival","received signal strength","location estimation techniques","parallel schemes","serial schemes","cognitive radio system","hybrid RSS-TOA localization techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Localization","Cognitive radio","Received signal strength","Time of arrival"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775388","doi":"10.1109/KST.2014.6775388","publicationTitle":"2014 6th International Conference on Knowledge and Smart Technology (KST)","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed two hybrid RSS/TOA localization techniques in cognitive radio system including serial and parallel schemes.

To effectively render realistic virtual environments, the difference between desired and rendered dynamics must be small. In this paper, we analyze the closed-loop dynamics of haptic displays for three common virtual environments: a spring, a damper, and a spring-damper, including the effects of time delay and low-pass filtering. Using a linear model, we identify important parameters for accuracy in terms of \u201ceffective impedances,\u201d a conceptual tool that decomposes the display's closed-loop impedance to components with physical analogs. Our results establish bandwidth limits for rendering effective stiffness and damping. The stiffness bandwidth is limited by the virtual stiffness and device mass, and the damping bandwidth is limited by the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter. Time delay reduces the effective damping of spring and spring-damper displays, reduces the effective mass for damper displays, and can introduce effective jerk feedback; otherwise delay has negligible effect on accuracy (when the system is stable). Experimental data gathered with a Phantom Premium 1.5 validates the theoretical analysis. This work informs haptic display design by presenting how closed-loop behavior changes with key parameters.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Haptic interfaces","Damping","Impedance","Delays","Shock absorbers","Springs","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","computer displays","damping","delays","force feedback","haptic interfaces","low-pass filters","rendering (computer graphics)","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop stiffness","damping accuracy","impedance-type kinesthetic haptic display","arbitrary desired dynamics render\u00efng","human operator","force feedback","realistic virtual environment rendering","rendered dynamics","closed-loop dynamics","time delay","low-pass filtering","linear model","effective impedance","display closed-loop impedance decomposition","stiffness bandwidth","virtual stiffness","device mass","damping bandwidth","cut-off frequency","spring-damper display","jerk feedback","system stability","Phantom Premium 1.5","closed-loop behavior"]},{"kwd":["L.2.0.a [Haptics]: Kinesthetic devices","L.2.0.o [Haptics]: Transparency","L.2.0.u [Haptics] System design and analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HAPTICS.2014.6775439","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Haptics Symposium (HAPTICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Haptics Symposium (HAPTICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766335/6775411/06775439.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HAPTICS.2014.6775439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-loop stiffness and damping accuracy of impedance-type haptic displays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Closed-loop stiffness and damping accuracy of impedance-type haptic displays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775439/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775439/","accessionNumber":"14182289","conferenceDate":"23-26 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Feb. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-loop stiffness and damping accuracy of impedance-type haptic displays","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"097102colonnese.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050576S","chronDate":"23-26 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766335","isNumber":"6775411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766335","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6775411","articleId":"6775439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6775475,"authors":[{"name":"Heather Culbertson","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Heather","lastName":"Culbertson","id":"38232839100"},{"name":"Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Delgado","affiliation":["University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, US"],"firstName":"Juan Jos\u00e9","lastName":"L\u00f3pez Delgado","id":"37086731040"},{"name":"Katherine J.

HaTT includes 100 haptic texture and friction models, the recorded data from which the models were made, images of the textures, and the code and methods necessary to render these textures using an impedance-type haptic interface such as a SensAble Phantom Omni. This paper reviews our previously developed methods for modeling haptic virtual textures, describes our technique for modeling Coulomb friction between a tooltip and a surface, discusses the adaptation of our rendering methods for display using an impedance-type haptic device, and provides an overview of the information included in the toolkit. Each texture and friction model was based on a ten-second recording of the force, speed, and high-frequency acceleration experienced by a handheld tool moved by an experimenter against the surface in a natural manner. We modeled each texture's recorded acceleration signal as a piecewise autoregressive (AR) process and stored the individual AR models in a Delaunay triangulation as a function of the force and speed used when recording the data. To increase the adaptability and utility of HaTT, we developed a method for resampling the texture models so they can be rendered at a sampling rate other than the 10 kHz used when recording data. Measurements of the user's instantaneous normal force and tangential speed are used to synthesize texture vibrations in real time. These vibrations are transformed into a texture force vector that is added to the friction and normal force vectors for display to the user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6775475/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14182247","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"One hundred data-driven haptic texture models and open-source methods for rendering on 3D objects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One hundred data-driven haptic texture models and open-source methods for rendering on 3D objects","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"319325culbertson.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071819S","chronDate":"23-26 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766335","isNumber":"6775411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766335","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6775411","articleId":"6775475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6775528,"authors":[{"name":"Sangyul Park","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sangyul","lastName":"Park","id":"37076805900"},{"name":"Dongjun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Dongjun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37077171500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3131-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2324-7355"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2324-7347"}],"articleNumber":"6775528","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"abstract":"We propose a configuration-space (C-space) based data-driven haptic rendering framework, which, by relying on the dynamics/kinematics formulation in the C-space, enables us to naturally address the haptic interaction of multi-link virtual proxy with visco-elastic type deformable virtual objects, while also allowing for quick rendering of multi-point contact between the virtual proxy and the virtual objects.

Its usage is increasing because of possible applications like electric vehicles, which require an efficient motor drive. However, most control techniques obtain speed from the shaft encoder. These are the disadvantages which are unacceptable for most applications. Thus, in present, research in this area is mostly focused on applying speed sensorless and obtains robust induction motor. The ability of Artificial Neural Networks to map arbitrary nonlinear function has been used to investigate estimation of speed in induction motor, where the inputs of the network are the voltage and current of stator. This work has attracted attention in recent years, though very little work has been done so far because of the complexity of the problem. This work makes an important contribution to the area of induction motor by off-line trained speed estimators, using d-q axis dynamic equations.

Power-level control is a crucial technique which can deeply affect the operation stability and efficiency of PWRs. Comparing with the classical power-level control, the advanced power-level control may strengthen both the closed-loop stability and control performance by feeding back internal state-variables. However, not all of the internal state variables of a PWR can be measured directly. To implement advanced power-level control laws, it is necessary to develop a state-observer to reconstruct the unmeasurable state-variables. Since a PWR is naturally a complex nonlinear system with its parameters varying with the powerlevel, fuel burnup, Xenon isotope production, control rod worth and etc, it is meaningful to design a nonlinear observer for the PWR with adaptability to system uncertainties. Due to this and the strong learning capability of the multilayer artificial neural network (MNN), an MNN-based nonlinear adaptive observer is given for PWRs. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved theoretically that this newly-built observer can provide bounded and convergent state-observation. This observer is then applied to the state-observation of a special PWR, i.e. the nuclear heating reactor (NHR), and numerical simulation results not only verify its feasibility but also show the relationship between the performance and parameter values of this newly-built observer.","doi":"10.1109/CAC.2013.6775712","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAC.2013.6775712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775686","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765548/6775686/06775712.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural-network-based adaptive state-observer for pressurized water reactors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775712/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural-network-based adaptive state-observer for pressurized water reactors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775712/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14181897","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","conferenceDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural-network-based adaptive state-observer for pressurized water reactors","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"02222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075426S","chronDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765548","isNumber":"6775686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765548","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6775686","articleId":"6775712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6775747,"authors":[{"name":"Hongxiu Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power Transmission and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hongxiu","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37086749810"},{"name":"Yong Lei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Fluid Power Transmission and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Lei","id":"38468074900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0333-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0332-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6775747","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Automation","Laboratories","Reliability","Safety","Real-time systems","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controller area networks","fault tolerant computing","inference mechanisms","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data driven root cause analysis","intermittent connection faults","controller area networks","networked automation systems","information exchange","CAN","system fault","network fault","discrete random process theory","quasiperiod pattern recognition method","root cause reasoning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CAN","intermittent connection","root cause analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775747","doi":"10.1109/CAC.2013.6775747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAC.2013.6775747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775686","publicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765548/6775686/06775747.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data driven root cause analysis for intermittent connection faults in controller area networks","abstract":"In networked automation systems, network plays a central role in information exchange.

The proposed method consists of three main parts: the first part is a searching method which searches for vanishing point candidates by multiple population genetic algorithm, the second part is a locally tangent-based voting method which obtains the value of the fitness function for the first part, and the last part is a local dominant texture orientation estimation method which applies Gabor filter banks to estimate the local dominant orientation of the vanishing point candidate and its voters for the second part. The proposed method has been tested on a vanishing point dataset which contains over 200 various road images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is both efficient and effective in detecting vanishing point compared with some state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775770/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14181893","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775770/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","conferenceDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Road vanishing-point detection: A multi-population genetic algorithm based approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Road vanishing-point detection: A multi-population genetic algorithm based approach","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"08080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05872S","chronDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765548","isNumber":"6775686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765548","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6775686","articleId":"6775770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6775777,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsheng Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Dongsheng","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532174300"},{"name":"Chen Peng","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085553466"},{"name":"Long Jin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Jin","id":"38247242500"},{"name":"Yingbiao Ling","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yingbiao","lastName":"Ling","id":"37085559595"},{"name":"Yunong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yunong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279965700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0333-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0332-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6775777","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Convergence","Arrays","Problem-solving","Mathematical model","Integrated circuit modeling","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","neural nets","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ZFs","Zhang generalized inverse","Z-type methodology flexibility","time-varying generalized inverse","ZGI","time-varying left generalized inverse","TVLGI","Zhang left generalized inverse","Zhang functions","Z-type model design method","Getz-Marsden dynamic system","G-M dynamic system","linear activation function array","AF array","global exponential convergence","neural nets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Z-type models","Zhang problem solving","Generalized inverse","Getz-Marsden dynamic system","Neural nets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775777","abstract":"This paper demonstrates the flexibility of Z-type methodology for generating multiple solution-models of time-varying problems.

In this paper, a general process model (GPM) for unanticipated fault diagnosis is established. And combined with the characteristics of monitoring data, the corresponding diagnosis methods are researched. The model and the methods are used for online unanticipated fault detection, isolation and recognition. The GPM for the unanticipated fault diagnosis is designed, by adopting a three-layer progressive structure, which is comprised of an inherent detection layer (IDL), an unanticipated isolation layer (UIL) and an unanticipated recognition layer (URL). Several key problems in the GPM are analyzed, including the establishment and evaluation of detection statistics, the extraction of fault feature direction, and the design of fault isolation criterion and the calculation of contribution factor. The proposed model and methods are driven by pure data and they can detect and diagnose the unanticipated fault. The proposed approach is evaluated by using an example of a satellite's attitude control system, and excellent results have been obtained.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAC.2013.6775778","publicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765548/6775686/06775778.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"464","doi":"10.1109/CAC.2013.6775778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven diagnosing for unanticipated fault by a general process model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven diagnosing for unanticipated fault by a general process model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6775778/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14181974","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775778/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven diagnosing for unanticipated fault by a general process model","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"08888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078934S","chronDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765548","isNumber":"6775686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765548","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6775686","articleId":"6775778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6775790,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Tan","affiliation":["Institute of Unmanned System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tan","id":"37711245300"},{"name":"Xiangjing An","affiliation":["Institute of Unmanned System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xiangjing","lastName":"An","id":"37565563900"},{"name":"Tao Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Unmanned System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37334114200"},{"name":"Hangen He","affiliation":["Institute of Unmanned System, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Hangen","lastName":"He","id":"37291666400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0333-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0332-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6775790","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"abstract":"This paper extends one state-of-the-art filter-based depth recovery method in dynamic environments with motion assistance and sampling. Our method fuses a depth data stream and a visual image stream, well calibrated, to achieve a high quality depth representation of the dynamic environments. For motion assistance, we use the optical flow between visual images to calculate the position of each point in target frame, and use the coordinates of this position as our new features named as Projection Coordinates (PC). After using these new features together with classical features (such as color, image coordinates, and time) to build a whole feature space, we propose a sampling-based High Dimensional Gaussian Filter (HDGF) framework for depth recovery. For any target point, we first find its k nearest neighbors in the feature space, which have corresponding known depth values, and calculate its distance to each neighbor. Then, we use a HDGF to integrate these k distances and k known depth values, to estimate the depth of the target point. Our method shows significant advantages in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Computer vision","Dynamics","Visualization","Conferences","Optical imaging","Image motion analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","filtering theory","image classification","image colour analysis","image fusion","image motion analysis","image representation","image sequences","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling-based depth recovery","dynamic environments","motion assistance","filter-based depth recovery method","motion sampling","depth data stream","visual image stream","stream fusion","high quality depth representation","optical flow","position coordinates","projection coordinates","PC","color feature","image coordinates feature","time feature","feature space","sampling-based high dimensional Gaussian filter","HDGF","k nearest neighbors","depth values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image processing","depth recovery","dynamic environments","motion assistance","sampling","high dimensional Gaussian filter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CAC.2013.6775790","publicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765548/6775686/06775790.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAC.2013.6775790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-based depth recovery in dynamic environments with motion assistance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-based depth recovery in dynamic environments with motion assistance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775790/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775790/","accessionNumber":"14182005","conferenceDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-based depth recovery in dynamic environments with motion assistance","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"100100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044965S","chronDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765548","isNumber":"6775686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765548","xplore-issue":"6775686","articleId":"6775790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6775828,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanwen Yang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yuanwen","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086747043"},{"name":"Yi Mao","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Mao","id":"37086743099"},{"name":"Peng Yang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086742702"},{"name":"Yuanmeng Jiang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yuanmeng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086744286"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0333-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0332-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6775828","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6775828","abstract":"In this paper, to solve the unit commitment problem economically and quickly, an improved firefly algorithm (FA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm including both discrete and continuous parts was proposed.

The inheritance from earlier state and constraints to later period of time for running time and shutdown time were considered in repair strategy. The continuous PSO was used in units' load dispatch after the process of deciding starting-stopping states, where constraints of power balance, unit ramp, spinning reserve and lower and upper limits were considered. Deal with the upper limits using Penalty function. To solve the constraints of power balance, zooming in the particles of each dimension variables same proportionally, and through sharing the penalty terms among particle swarms the constraints of units' ramping rates are settled. Simulation results of 10-unit and 24-hour system show that the proposed method is correct, effective and predominant.","doi":"10.1109/CAC.2013.6775828","startPage":"718","endPage":"722","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765548/6775686/06775828.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Chinese Automation Congress","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAC.2013.6775828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The unit commitment problem based on an improved firefly and particle swarm optimization hybrid algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Power systems","Genetic algorithms","Educational institutions","Optimization","Time factors","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","particle swarm optimisation","power generation dispatch","power generation scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unit commitment problem","firefly algorithm","FA","particle swarm optimization algorithm","PSO algorithm","continuous algorithm","discrete binary real coded firefly algorithm","unit load dispatching","starting-stopping state","power balance constraint","spinning reserve","penalty function","unit ramping rate","time 24 h"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unit commitment","firefly algorithm","particle swarm optimization","penalty function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6775828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"The unit commitment problem based on an improved firefly and particle swarm optimization hybrid algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6775828/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","conferenceDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14182040","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The unit commitment problem based on an improved firefly and particle swarm optimization hybrid algorithm","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"138138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080681S","chronDate":"7-8 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765548","isNumber":"6775686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765548","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6775686","articleId":"6775828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6775844,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chao","affiliation":["Teaching and Research Institute of College Computer, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Chao","id":"37086775128"},{"name":"Zhao Yue","affiliation":["Teaching and Research Institute of College Computer, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Yue","id":"37086775281"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0333-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0332-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6775844","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"abstract":"The application of cloud computing technology provides a new idea to the development of mobile learning.

High crest factor signal forces a power amplifier in communication systems to back-off which leads to power efficiency degradation. Several techniques have been proposed in literature to mitigate the high peaks in OFDM signal; however most of them suffer from complexity and PAPR performance. In this paper a novel crest factor scheme based on recursive optimum frequency domain matrix is proposed which requires only two IFFT which results in significant reduction in the computational complexity.

The presented algorithm works directly in the time domain (pre-FFT method) by using the redundant information of the cyclic prefix and can be applied to any unitary or non-unitary constellation. Furthermore, all extracted parameters can be used to evaluate the signal quality within the receiver and build up applications such as Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) channel estimation or adaptive synchronization algorithm design, especially for Software Defined Radio (SDR) applications.

This is a significant chunk (70-80%) of the total SDRAM bandwidth and hence drives the bandwidth requirements. There is lot of overlap between the reference data required for every partition. This paper describes 2D or a block based caching scheme which exploits the commonality of reference pixel fetches across various partitions and thereby reducing the SDRAM bandwidth and power.

It is also known by many other names such as power line carrier and broadband using power line communication. PLC is used in a wide range of applications, like home automation, Internet access and also smart grid communication. However, due to the nature of the communication link (over power lines), PCL suffers the effect of different noise components. In this paper, asynchronous noise is further analyzed in PLC systems using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). It is well-known that the above noise is one the critical elements to be modeled and analyzed. In this paper, the OFDM sub-carriers are modulated using BPSK, 4-QAM and 16-PSK.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761345/6775879/06776046.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)","doi":"10.1109/ICCE.2014.6776046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE.2014.6776046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of OFDM-based power line communication under asynchronous noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","OFDM","Bit error rate","Power line communications","Binary phase shift keying","Smart grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","noise","OFDM modulation","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM based power line communication","PLC systems","asynchronous noise","home automation","Internet access","smart grid communication","BPSK","4-QAM","16-PSK"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Line Communication","OFDM","Impulsive Noise","Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)","inverse FFT (IFFT)","inverse FFT (IFFT)","Additive Gaussian Noise(AWGN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance of OFDM-based power line communication under asynchronous noise","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776046/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14181512","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","conferenceDate":"10-13 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of OFDM-based power line communication under asynchronous noise","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p371jagannathan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039301S","chronDate":"10-13 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6761345","isNumber":"6775879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761345","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6775879","articleId":"6776046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6776078,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Ik Park","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Ik","lastName":"Park","id":"37086667096"},{"name":"Heung Mook Kim","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Heung Mook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292766600"},{"name":"Jeongchang Kim","affiliation":["Korea Maritime University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongchang","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293495200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1291-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1290-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-3994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-4001"}],"articleNumber":"6776078","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"abstract":"This paper proposes an efficient implementation of enhanced min-sum algorithm (EMSA) for DVB-S2 LDPC decoding.

In conjunction with a powerful processor, this is a flexible and cheap possibility to develop communication systems. Due to the low development costs compared to the development in hardware and the high flexibility, SDRs have become popular in research and development. In order to ease the development of SDR applications, a generic platform-independent C++ toolkit has been developed. It supports data-dominated systems using multi-core architectures.

Simulation results show that particle filtering converges to the true track faster than Kalman filtering, at the price of higher computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLC-based indoor positioning system with tracking capability using Kalman and particle filters","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)","doi":"10.1109/ICCE.2014.6776093","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761345/6775879/06776093.pdf","startPage":"476","endPage":"477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE.2014.6776093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"VLC-based indoor positioning system with tracking capability using Kalman and particle filters","conferenceDate":"10-13 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776093/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14181602","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLC-based indoor positioning system with tracking capability using Kalman and particle filters","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p476ganti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085244S","chronDate":"10-13 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6761345","isNumber":"6775879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761345","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6775879","articleId":"6776093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6776116,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Using iterative receiver between the MISO detector and the decoder can approximate the optimal receiver performance. In this paper, we propose to use a modified soft K-Best List Sphere Decoder (KB-LSD) that iteratively uses the soft output LLR from LDPC decoder to calculate a prior LLR of the Maximum A Posterior Probability (MAP) of each transmitted symbol as a cost function of each child in the tree to decode the MISO SFBC to reach near optimal soft output MAP detection. We adapt the number of K paths chosen by the KB-LSD and the number of LDPC iterations according to the channel quality to achieve optimum receiver performance with reduced complexity of the system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6775879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCE.2014.6776140","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (ICCE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6761345/6775879/06776140.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"579","doi":"10.1109/ICCE.2014.6776140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive iterative decoding of MISO-BICM for DVB-T2","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive iterative decoding of MISO-BICM for DVB-T2","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6776140/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14181524","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776140/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive iterative decoding of MISO-BICM for DVB-T2","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"p576elbanna.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073506S","chronDate":"10-13 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6761345","isNumber":"6775879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6761345","xplore-issue":"6775879","articleId":"6776140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6776160,"authors":[{"name":"Vinod Mall","affiliation":["Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, Gujrat"],"firstName":"Vinod","lastName":"Mall","id":"38246784900"},{"name":"Anil K.

In this paper, we have proposed a real-time anomaly detection algorithm by utilizing cues from the motion vectors in H.264/AVC compressed domain. The discussed work is principally motivated by the observation that motion vectors (MVs) exhibit different characteristics during anomaly. We have observed that H.264 motion vector magnitude contains relevant information which can be used to model the usual behavior (UB) effectively. This is subsequently extended to detect abnormality/anomaly based on the probability of occurrence of a behavior. Additionally, we have suggested a hierarchical approach through Motion Pyramid for High Resolution videos to further increase the detection rate. The proposed algorithm has performed extremely well on UMN and Peds Anomaly Detection Video datasets, with a detection speed of >150 and 65-75 frames per sec in respective datasets resulting in more

theory of signal reconstruction via compressed sensing in order to obtain a high-resolution image derived by using a single down-sampled version of the same image. First, we enforce sparse overcomplete representations on the low-resolution patches of the input image. Then, using the sparse coefficients as obtained above, we reconstruct a high-resolution output image. A blurring matrix is introduced in order to enhance the incoherency between the sparsifying dictionary and the sensing matrices which also resulted in better preservation of image edges and other textures. When compared with the similar techniques, the proposed method yields much better result both visually and quantitatively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCVPRIPG.2013.6776176","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth National Conference on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Graphics (NCVPRIPG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth National Conference on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Graphics (NCVPRIPG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765546/6776148/06776176.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/NCVPRIPG.2013.6776176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single image super-resolution using compressive sensing with learned overcomplete dictionary","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Single image super-resolution using compressive sensing with learned overcomplete dictionary","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6776176/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14181786","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776176/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single image super-resolution using compressive sensing with learned overcomplete dictionary","confLoc":"Jodhpur, India","sourcePdf":"Paper225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071651S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765546","isNumber":"6776148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765546","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6776148","articleId":"6776176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6776181,"authors":[{"name":"Arindam Das","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Narula Institute of Technology, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Das","id":"37061289500"},{"name":"Ujjwal Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit, Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Ujjwal","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37270044800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1588-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1586-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6776181","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776181","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Handwriting recognition","Character recognition","Handheld computers","Benchmark testing","Text recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Android (operating system)","handwriting recognition","image retrieval","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ISIgraphy tool","online handwriting sample database generation","online handwriting recognition","Indian scripts","Technology Development for Indian Languages","TDIL","Ministry of Communication and Information Technology","MC&IT","India","research and development works","Android platform","handheld devices","data collection","Google Play","stored data retrieval","stored data display","electronic mail"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Online handwriting recognition","database generation","online handwriting database"]}],"abstract":"Online handwriting recognition research has recently received significant thrust. Specifically for Indian scripts, handwriting recognition has not been focused much till in the near past. However, due to generous Government funding through the group on Technology Development for Indian Languages (TDIL) of the Ministry of Communication & Information Technology (MC&IT), Govt. of India, research in this area has received due attention and several groups are now engaged in research and development works for online handwriting recognition in different Indian scripts. An extensive bottleneck of the desired progress in this area is the difficulty of collection of large sample databases of online handwriting in various scripts. Towards the same, recently a user-friendly tool on Android platform has been developed to collect data on handheld devices. This tool is called ISIgraphy and has been uploaded in the Google Play for free download. This application is designed well enough to store handwritten data samples in large scales in user-given file names for distinct users. Its use is script independent, meaning that it can collect and store handwriting samples written in any language, not necessarily an Indian script. It has an additional module for retrieval and display of stored data. Moreover, it can directly send the collected data to others via electronic mail.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCVPRIPG.2013.6776181","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth National Conference on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Graphics (NCVPRIPG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth National Conference on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Graphics (NCVPRIPG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765546/6776148/06776181.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/NCVPRIPG.2013.6776181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISIgraphy: A tool for online handwriting sample database generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"ISIgraphy: A tool for online handwriting sample database generation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6776181/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14181831","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776181/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISIgraphy: A tool for online handwriting sample database generation","confLoc":"Jodhpur, India","sourcePdf":"Paper344.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06572S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765546","isNumber":"6776148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765546","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6776148","articleId":"6776181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6776186,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The performance of RBFNN depends on the design of the structure of RBFNN, which includes optimal center selection and spread of RBF units, number of neurons at hidden layer, weights etc. Design of hidden layer of RBFNN also includes the choice of basis functions which is proposed to be of Multiquadric basis functions. The shape of Multiquadric basis function plays an important role in the performance of RBFNN in face recognition. A novel evolutionary shape parameter optimization technique inspired by the attractiveness of the natural fireflies is proposed and is used in the design of Multiquadric basis functions for the given face database. The algorithm is tested on two benchmarked face databases ORL and Indian face databases. The proposed technique significantly outperforms the performance of the Gaussian basis functions based RBFNN in terms of face recognition accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/NCVPRIPG.2013.6776196","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth National Conference on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Graphics (NCVPRIPG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765546/6776148/06776196.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth National Conference on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Graphics (NCVPRIPG)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCVPRIPG.2013.6776196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary design of Multiquadric radial basis functions neural network for face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Shape","Databases","Accuracy","Radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","face recognition","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary design","multiquadric radial basis functions neural network","face recognition","RBFNN","optimal center selection","evolutionary shape parameter optimization technique","natural fireflies","face databases ORL","Indian face databases","Gaussian basis functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face Recognition","Firefly","Multiquadric basis functions","Shape Parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary design of Multiquadric radial basis functions neural network for face recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776196/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14181795","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary design of Multiquadric radial basis functions neural network for face recognition","confLoc":"Jodhpur, India","sourcePdf":"Paper151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059322S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765546","isNumber":"6776148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765546","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6776148","articleId":"6776196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6776198,"authors":[{"name":"Aniruddha Acharya K","affiliation":["Video Anaytics Laboratory, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"lastName":"Aniruddha Acharya K","id":"37086780000"},{"name":"R.

It has been successfully applied in various computer vision algorithms like object detection, object tracking, robotic mapping and large scale image retrieval. Although SIFT descriptors are highly robust towards scale and rotation variations, the high computational complexity of the SIFT algorithm inhibits its use in applications demanding real time response, and in algorithms dealing with very large scale databases. This paper presents a parallel implementation of SIFT on a GPU, where we obtain a speed of around 55 fps for a 640\u00d7480 image. One of the main contributions of our work is the novel combined kernel optimization that has led to a significant improvement of 21.79% in the execution speed.

The 3D skeleton joint co-ordinates of the user provided by motion capture system are used to analyze the dynamics of the action being performed. The temporal variance of each joint of the skeleton and its time weighted variance serve as the features for classification. The time weighted variance feature embeds temporal information in the feature and helps in discriminating confusing actions such as sit-down and stand-up. These features can be extracted rapidly and suitable for real-time recognition.

With a few notable exceptions, most previous works in the last several decades have focused on recognizing faces captured in a laboratory setting. However, with the introduction of databases such as LFW and Pubfigs, face recognition community is gradually shifting its focus on much more challenging unconstrained settings. Since its introduction, LFW verification benchmark is getting a lot of attention with various researchers contributing towards state-of-the-results. To further boost the unconstrained face recognition research, we introduce a more challenging Indian Movie Face Database (IMFDB) that has much more variability compared to LFW and Pubfigs. The database consists of 34512 faces of 100 known actors collected from approximately 103 Indian movies. Unlike LFW and Pubfigs which used face detectors to automatically detect the faces from the web collection, faces in IMFDB are detected manually from all the movies. Manual selection of faces from movies resulted in high degree of variability (in scale, pose, expression, illumination, age, occlusion, makeup) which one could ever see in natural world. IMFDB is the first face database that provides a detailed annotation in terms of age, pose, gender, expression, amount of occlusion, for each face which may help other face related applications.","doi":"10.1109/NCVPRIPG.2013.6776225","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Fourth National Conference on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Graphics (NCVPRIPG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6765546/6776148/06776225.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Fourth National Conference on Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing and Graphics (NCVPRIPG)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NCVPRIPG.2013.6776225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indian Movie Face Database: A benchmark for face recognition under wide variations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Databases","Motion pictures","Face recognition","Lighting","Manuals","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","face recognition","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Indian movie face database","human face recognition","computer vision","LFW databases","Pubfigs databases","LFW verification benchmark","IMFDB","face detectors","Web collection","variability degree","face selection","scale variability","pose variability","expression variability","illumination variability","occlusion variability","makeup variability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Indian Movie Face Database: A benchmark for face recognition under wide variations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776225/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14181829","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indian Movie Face Database: A benchmark for face recognition under wide variations","confLoc":"Jodhpur, India","sourcePdf":"Paper337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056362S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6765546","isNumber":"6776148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6765546","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6776148","articleId":"6776225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":6776227,"authors":[{"name":"Nitin J.

The panchromatic (Pan) and multi-spectral (MS) images provided by many satellites have high spatial and high spectral resolutions, respectively. The pan-sharpened image which has high spatial and spectral resolutions is obtained by using these images. Since the NSCT is shift invariant and it has better directional decomposition capability compared to contourlet transform, we use it to extract high frequency information from the available Pan image. First, two level NSCT decomposition is performed on the Pan image which has high spatial resolution. The required high frequency details are obtained by using the coarser subband available after the two level NSCT decomposition of the Pan image. The coarser sub-band is subtracted from the original Pan image to obtain these details. These extracted details are then added to MS image such that the original spectral signature is preserved in the final fused image. The experiments have been conducted on images captured from different satellite sensors such as IKonos-2, Worlview-2 and Quickbird. The traditional quantitative measures along with quality with no reference (QNR) index are evaluated to check the potential of the proposed method.

This antenna has stair-slots on the ground and two p-i-n diodes are used for switching the antenna's polarization in linear polarization (LP), left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) and right-hand circular polarization (RHCP). The structure is concise and easy to optimize, and dc bias network is very simple. The measured impedance (-10-db S11) and 3-dB axial-ratio (AR) bandwidths are about 180 and 37 MHz, respectively, at the center frequency around 2.46 GHz for both LHCP and RHCP. Compared to the reference antennas (antenna with loop slots on the ground and antenna with L-shaped slots on the ground), the bandwidths of -10-dB S11 and 3-dB AR are greatly enhanced. The asymmetrical slotted ground excites TM10 and TM01 modes with different resonant frequency to generate CP radiation, and because of the stair-slots, instead of loop slots and L-shaped slots, the lower resonant frequency decreases and the higher one increases. Thus, the bandwidths are improved. The antenna has good switchable and radiation performances. It could be used for wireless local area network (WLAN) (2.4-2.5 GHz) in wireless communication systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","volume":"13","accessionNumber":"14219294","publicationDate":"2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776390/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bandwidth Enhancement of a Polarization-Reconfigurable Patch Antenna With Stair-Slots on the Ground","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bandwidth Enhancement of a Polarization-Reconfigurable Patch Antenna With Stair-Slots on the Ground","sourcePdf":"lawp-yang-2312971-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054869S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6719497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6719497","articleId":"6776390","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6776391,"authors":[{"name":"Vobulapuram Ramesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6913024/6776391/6776391-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vobulapuram Ramesh Kumar (S\u201913) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Bapatla Engineering College, Bapatla, India, in 2007, and the M.Tech. degree from National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India, in 2010.

The antenna employs a single feed and two crossed asymmetric dipoles as the primary radiating elements. In order to achieve a low profile and broadband characteristics in terms of impedance matching and 3-dB axial-ratio (AR) bandwidths at both bands, a dual-band AMC is utilized as a reflector of the antenna. The AMC structure utilizes four T-shaped slits in a unit-cell patch to significantly reduce its first and second resonant frequency ratio, and consequently its first and second resonances are easily adjusted for the desired operating frequencies. For performance verification, an antenna prototype was fabricated with an overall 2.4-GHz frequency size of 0.576\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n \u00d7 0.576\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n \u00d7 0.088\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n (72 \u00d7 72 \u00d7 11 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n).

The diode-seeding and the master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) design allow for the construction of extremely versatile laser systems that can operate over wide ranges of peak power, pulse energy and repetition rate in the ultrashort picosecond to the long nanosecond pulsed regimes. We present a record peak power of 130 kW and pulse energy of 5 \u03bcJ in picosecond mode, while demonstrating user-defined pulse-shaping capabilities at millijoule pulse energy levels in the nanosecond regime from essentially the same amplifier system. The system architecture as well as important design and power scaling considerations are discussed in detail. Additionally, we highlight recent results in the application of these MOPA systems and their high performance TDFA stages in such diverse application areas as next generation telecommunication networks, mid-infrared supercontinuum generation and mid-infrared gas detection in hollow-core photonic bandgap fibers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2014.2312933","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum

Electrical and fluidic testing demonstrates good bonding of the electrical and fluidic microbumps; the average resistance of a single electrical microbump is 13.5 mQ. The bonded fluidic microbumps are successfully tested up to 100 kPa without any leakage. Moreover, the power supply noise (PSN) of 3-D chip stacks is analyzed using a compact physical model. Based on the model, increasing the number of power/ground pads is effective in suppressing PSN, motivating the need for fine-pitch electrical microbumps.

The design of a biochip with DNA computing as a carrier has become a key area in the development of a DNA molecular computer. The half adder, as the basic unit of various arithmetic units, has a complex structure that directly affects the overall complexity of a computer's structure. In this study, a half adder on a microfluidic chip is developed by means of bio-reaction. This technology is combined with a biochip and adopts glass and polydimethylsiloxane to fabricate a microscale hybrid chip. Using a DNA strand as an operand, realization of the half adder on a microfluidic chip is achieved by controlling the annealing and denaturation of double-stranded DNA. The computing results are rapidly and accurately obtained by detecting the presence of double-stranded DNA in a solution by agarose gel electrophoresis. The microfluidic half-adder chip accurately realizes half-adder computations and overcomes the shortcomings of traditional integrated circuit half adders, optical half adders, and chemical molecule half adders, such as complex structure, limited component size, and low accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2014.2311792","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2014.2311792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/6823760/06776462.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Adders","Microfluidics","Microvalves","Electrodes","Glass","Annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","annealing","biochemistry","biocomputing","bioMEMS","biomolecular electronics","biotechnology","electrophoresis","glass","microfluidics","polymers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical molecule half adders","optical half adders","integrated circuit half adders","agarose gel electrophoresis","denaturation","annealing","microscale hybrid chip","polydimethylsiloxane","glass","bioreaction","DNA molecular computer","biochip design","DNA computing","double-stranded DNA","microfluidic half adder chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Agarose gel electrophoresis","DNA computing","half adder","microfluidic chip","polydimethylsiloxane"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computers, Molecular","DNA","Dimethylpolysiloxanes","Electrodes","Equipment Design","Microfluidic Analytical Techniques"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Microfluidic Half Adder Chip Based on Double-Stranded DNA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Microfluidic Half Adder Chip Based on Double-Stranded DNA","pubMedId":"24691162","htmlLink":"/document/6776462/","accessionNumber":"14349279","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61073101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Microfluidic Half Adder Chip Based on Double-Stranded DNA","sourcePdf":"tnb-huang-2311792-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064694S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"6823760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6823760","articleId":"6776462","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6776466,"authors":[{"name":"Dario Petri","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6895337/6776466/petri-2308996-small.gif","p":["Dario Petri (M'92\u2013SM'05\u2013F'09) received the M.Sc.

In this paper, a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based algorithm based on a dynamic phasor model (referred to as interpolated dynamic DFT-based synchrophasor estimator) is used to estimate not only amplitude and phase of the collected waveforms, but also their frequency and rate of change of frequency.

The sub-carriers though, experience different degrees of fading and thus, the received power is different for different sub-carriers; while some frequencies experience deep fades, others are relatively unaffected. In this paper, we make a case for redistributing the power across the sub-carriers (subject to a fixed power budget constraint) to better cope with this frequency selectivity. Specifically, we design a joint power and rate adaptation scheme (called JPRA for short) wherein power redistribution is combined with sub-carrier level rate adaptation to yield significant throughput benefits. We further consider three variants of JPRA: (a) JPRA-Basic where, the power is redistributed across sub-carriers so as to support a maximum common rate across all the sub-carriers (b) JPRA-Intermediate where, the power is redistributed across sub-carriers so as to support a maximum common rate across a \u201csubset\u201d of sub-carriers such that the aggregate rate is maximized. (c) JPRA-Adaptive where, the goal is to redistribute power such that the transmission time of a packet is minimized. While the first two variants decrease transceiver complexity and are simpler, the third is geared towards achieving the maximum throughput possible. We implement all three variants of JPRA on our WARP radio testbed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that JPRA can provide a 35 percent improvement in total network throughput in testbed experiments compared to FARA, a scheme where only sub-carrier level rate adaptation is used. We also perform simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of JPRA in larger scale networks.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2014.2312716","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6971280/06776473.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2014.2312716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sub-Carrier Level Power Allocation in OFDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776473/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sub-Carrier Level Power Allocation in OFDMA Networks","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14805539","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776473/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sub-Carrier Level Power Allocation in OFDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-singh-2312716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086726S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6971280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6971280","articleId":"6776473","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6776507,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Pei","affiliation":["Chair of Software Engineering, Department of Computer Science, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/6815702/6776507/6776507-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Pei received the PhD degree in computer science from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University, China.

To provide high-quality fix suggestions and to enable automation of the whole debugging process, AutoFix relies on the presence of simple specification elements in the form of contracts (such as pre- and postconditions). Using contracts enhances the precision of dynamic analysis techniques for fault detection and localization, and for validating fixes. The only required user input to the AutoFix supporting tool is then a faulty program annotated with contracts; the tool produces a collection of validated fixes for the fault ranked according to an estimate of their suitability. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we applied AutoFix to over 200 faults in four code bases of different maturity and quality (of implementation and of contracts). AutoFix successfully fixed 42 percent of the faults, producing, in the majority of cases, corrections of quality comparable to those competent programmers would write; the used computational resources were modest, with an average time per fix below 20 minutes on commodity hardware. These figures compare favorably to the state of the art in automated program fixing, and demonstrate that the AutoFix approach is successfully applicable to reduce the debugging burden in real-world scenarios.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6815702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2014.2312918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/6815702/06776507.pdf","startPage":"427","endPage":"449","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2014.2312918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Fixing of Programs with Contracts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Automated Fixing of Programs with Contracts","volume":"40","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6776507/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299401","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776507/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Fixing of Programs with Contracts","sourcePdf":"tse-furia-2312918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.186799S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"6815702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6815702","articleId":"6776507","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":6776519,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6823767/6776519/zhang-2310240-small.gif","p":["\nQing Zhang received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science and\ntechnology from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently working toward the\nPh.D. degree in the School of Computer.","His research interests include image and video processing and computational photography."]},"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085501560"},{"name":"Chunxia Xiao","affiliation":["School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6823767/6776519/xiao-2310240-small.gif","p":["\nChunxia Xiao received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Hunan Normal\nUniversity, Changsha, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the State Key Laboratory of CAD\n& CG, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2006.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.

We first construct a significance map which highlights the difference between cloud regions and noncloud regions. Based on the significance map and the proposed optimal threshold setting, we obtain a coarse cloud detection result which classifies the input aerial photograph into the candidate cloud regions and noncloud regions. In order to accurately detect the cloud regions from the candidate cloud regions, we then construct a robust detail map derived from a multiscale bilateral decomposition to guide us in removing noncloud regions from the candidate cloud regions. Finally, we further perform a guided feathering to achieve our final cloud detection result, which detects semitransparent cloud pixels around the boundaries of cloud regions. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of both visual and quantitative comparisons, and the evaluation results show that our proposed method works well for the cloud detection of color aerial photographs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14333158","volume":"52","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6776519/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cloud Detection of RGB Color Aerial Photographs by Progressive Refinement Scheme","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB725303"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41271431"},{"fundingName":"New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0441"},{"fundingName":"Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of Computer Aided Design and Computer Graphics","grantNumber":"A1208"},{"fundingName":"Key grant project of Hubei province","grantNumber":"2013AAA020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Detection of RGB Color Aerial Photographs by Progressive Refinement Scheme","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2310240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081518S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6823767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6823767","articleId":"6776519","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6776522,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Sigurdsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6823767/6776522/sigur-2303155-small.gif","p":["\nJakob Sigurdsson (S'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the\nUniversity of Iceland, Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include statistical signal processing, remote sensing, and image processing."]},"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Sigurdsson","id":"38502617400"},{"name":"Magnus Orn Ulfarsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6823767/6776522/ulfar-2303155-small.gif","p":["\nMagnus Orn Ulfarsson (S'00\u2013M'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees\nfrom the University of Iceland, Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of\nMichigan, Ann Arbor, MI USA, in 2007.","In 2007, he joined the University of Iceland, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

We propose spin-memristor threshold logic (SMTL) gates, which employ a memristive cross-bar array to perform current-mode summation of binary inputs, whereas the low-voltage fast-switching spintronic threshold devices carry out the threshold operation in an energy efficient manner. Field-programmable SMTL gate arrays can operate at a small terminal voltage of ~50 mV, resulting in ultralow power consumption in gates as well as programmable interconnect networks. We evaluate the performance of SMTL using threshold logic synthesis.

With N amplifiers driving N loads, a favorite choice is a \u201cdecoupling\u201d network, which is a lossless reciprocal network that has N input ports connected to the sources and N output ports connected to the loads. The decoupling network transforms the coupled impedance of the loads into the uncoupled characteristic impedance of the sources. Any incident signal at the input ports of the network is transferred, without reflection, to the loads. Decoupling networks can be realized by generalized \u03a0-networks of lumped and distributed impedances, depending on the design frequency. Although the impedance requirements of the network are unique, its realization is not, and networks that involve many impedances can be difficult to lay out on circuit boards. In this paper, we establish that a decoupling network requires a minimum of N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n+N impedances for N arbitrarily coupled loads, and provide a systematic method for realizing this lower bound. We also provide methods for selectively eliminating impedances. We give an example where only 4N impedances are needed for loads that have coupling symmetry.

For this reason, renaming a program entity, i.e., altering the entity identifier, is an important activity during software evolution. Developers rename when they feel that the name of an entity is not (anymore) consistent with its functionality, or when such a name may be misleading. A survey that we performed with 71 developers suggests that 39 percent perform renaming from a few times per week to almost every day and that 92 percent of the participants consider that renaming is not straightforward. However, despite the cost that is associated with renaming, renamings are seldom if ever documented-for example, less than 1 percent of the renamings in the five programs that we studied. This explains why participants largely agree on the usefulness of automatically documenting renamings. In this paper we propose REanaming Program ENTities (REPENT), an approach to automatically document-detect and classify-identifier renamings in source code. REPENT detects renamings based on a combination of source code differencing and data flow analyses. Using a set of natural language tools, REPENT classifies renamings into the different dimensions of a taxonomy that we defined. Using the documented renamings, developers will be able to, for example, look up methods that are part of the public API (as they impact client applications), or look for inconsistencies between the name and the implementation of an entity that underwent a high risk renaming (e.g., towards the opposite meaning). We evaluate the accuracy and completeness of REPENT on the evolution history of five open-source Java programs. The study indicates a precision of 88 percent and a recall of 92 percent. In addition, we report an exploratory study investigating and discussing how identifiers are renamed in the five programs, according to our taxonomy.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2014.2312942","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/6815702/06776542.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2014.2312942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6815702","startPage":"502","endPage":"532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"REPENT: Analyzing the Nature of Identifier Renamings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"REPENT: Analyzing the Nature of Identifier Renamings","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299403","dateOfInsertion":"14 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6776542/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REPENT: Analyzing the Nature of Identifier Renamings","sourcePdf":"tse-arnaoudova-2312942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147812S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"6815702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6815702","articleId":"6776542","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6776556,"authors":[{"name":"Michael C.

However, obstacle interactions impose constraints that conform the robot body into arbitrary shapes regardless of actuator positions. Generally, these effects cannot be wholly sensed on a continuum manipulator and, therefore, render model-based controllers incorrect, leading to artificial singularities and unstable behavior. We present a task-space closed-loop controller for continuum manipulators that does not rely on a model and can be used in constrained environments. Using an optimal control strategy on a tendon-driven robot, we demonstrate this method, which we term model-less control, which allows the manipulator to interact with several constrained environments in a stable manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in controlling continuum manipulators without using a model.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2014.2309194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/6869067/06776556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2014.2309194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6869067","startPage":"880","endPage":"889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Less Feedback Control of Continuum Manipulators in Constrained Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-Less Feedback Control of Continuum Manipulators in Constrained Environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14501255","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6776556/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Less Feedback Control of Continuum Manipulators in Constrained Environments","sourcePdf":"tro-yip-2309194-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116618S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6869067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"6869067","articleId":"6776556","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6776560,"authors":[{"name":"Sayanan Sivaraman","affiliation":["Laboratory for Intelligent and Safe Automobiles, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6910343/6776560/sivar-2309055-small.gif","p":["\nSayanan Sivaraman (M'07) received the B.S. degree from University of\nMaryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 2007 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from University of California, San Diego, La\nJolla, CA, USA, in 2009 and 2013, respectively, all in electrical engineering, with a focus on intelligent systems,\nrobotics, and controls.","He is with Volkswagen Group of America, Electronics Research Laboratory, Belmont, CA.

The DPDM is a flexible representation and readily accepts data from a variety of sensor modalities to represent the on-road environment as a spatially coded data structure, encapsulating spatial, dynamic, and legal information. Using the DPDM, we develop a general predictive system for LCMs. We formulate the LCM assistance system to solve for the minimum-cost solution to merge or change lanes, which is solved efficiently using dynamic programming over the DPDM. Based on the DPDM, the LCM system recommends the required acceleration and timing to safely merge or change lanes with minimum cost. System performance has been extensively validated using real-world on-road data, including urban driving, on-ramp merges, and both dense and free-flow highway conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Radar tracking","Vehicle dynamics","Laser radar","Road transportation","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","driver information systems","dynamic programming","probability","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic probabilistic drivability maps","probabilistic compact representation","on-road environment","DPDM","predictive lane change and merge driver assistance","predictive LCM driver assistance","highway driving","urban driving","sensor modalities","spatially coded data structure","spatial information encapsulation","dynamic information encapsulation","legal information encapsulation","general predictive system","minimum-cost solution","dynamic programming","free-flow highway conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic programming","lane change","merge","predictive driver assistance","probabilistic modeling"]},{"kwd":["Dynamic programming","lane change","merge","predictive driver assistance","probabilistic modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TITS.2014.2309055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/6910343/06776560.pdf","startPage":"2063","endPage":"2073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6910343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2014.2309055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Probabilistic Drivability Maps for Lane Change and Merge Driver Assistance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Probabilistic Drivability Maps for Lane Change and Merge Driver Assistance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776560/","volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776560/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14615787","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Probabilistic Drivability Maps for Lane Change and Merge Driver Assistance","sourcePdf":"tits-sivaraman-2309055-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146381S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6910343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6910343","articleId":"6776560","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":6776562,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Yin","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6776562/yin-2312885-small.gif","p":["\nShen Yin (M'12) received the B.E. degree in automation from Harbin\nInstitute of Technology, Harbin, China, and the M.Sc. degree in control and information systems and the Ph.D. degree in\nelectrical engineering and information technology from the University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany."," He is currently an Associate Professor at Harbin Institute of Technology.

Nevertheless, belief-propagation (BP) based decoding of these codes suffers from the error-floor problem, i.e., an abrupt change in the slope of the error-rate curve that occurs at very low error rates. Recently, a new type of decoders termed finite alphabet iterative decoders (FAIDs) were introduced. The FAIDs use simple Boolean maps for variable node processing, and can surpass the BP-based decoders in the error floor region with very short word length. We restrict the scope of this paper to regular d\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">v</sub>\n=3 LDPC codes on the BSC channel. This paper develops a low-complexity implementation architecture for the FAIDs by making use of their properties. Particularly, an innovative bit-serial check node unit is designed for the FAIDs, and a small-area variable node unit is proposed by exploiting the symmetry in the Boolean maps. Moreover, an optimized data scheduling scheme is proposed to increase the hardware utilization efficiency. From synthesis results, the proposed FAID implementation needs only 52% area to reach the same throughput as one of the most efficient standard Min-Sum decoders for an example (7807, 7177) LDPC code, while achieving better error-correcting performance in the error-floor region. Compared to an offset Min-Sum decoder with longer word length, the proposed design can achieve higher throughput with 45% area, and still leads to possible performance improvement in the error-floor region.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2309896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6805240/06776564.pdf","startPage":"1366","endPage":"1375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6805240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2309896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders for LDPC Codes: Optimization, Architecture and Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776564","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders for LDPC Codes: Optimization, Architecture and Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776564/","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14265374","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776564/","volume":"61","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-0846331, ECCS-0802159, CCF-0963726 and CCF-1314147"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004795","fundingName":"Institut Universitaire de France"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders for LDPC Codes: Optimization, Architecture and Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcsi-cai-2309896-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150656S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6805240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6805240","articleId":"6776564","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6776565,"authors":[{"name":"Tossaporn Surinkaew","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tossaporn","lastName":"Surinkaew","id":"37071297700"},{"name":"Issarachai Ngamroo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Issarachai","lastName":"Ngamroo","id":"37314238300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1949-3029"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1949-3037"}],"articleNumber":"6776565","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Damping","Uncertainty","Power system stability","Wind turbines","Voltage control","Synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","compensation","optimisation","power generation control","power system stability","robust control","synchronous generators","uncertain systems","vibration control","wind power","wind power plants","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated robust control","DFIG wind turbines","doubly fed induction generator wind turbine","PSS","power system stabilizer","power system oscillation stabilization","system uncertainties","intermittent wind power","generating condition","loading condition","power system stabilizing controllers","synchronous generator","inverse output multiplicative perturbation","POD structure","PSS structure","second-order lead-lag compensator","parameter optimization problem","firefly algorithm","IEEE-39 bus New England system","power oscillation damper"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine","firefly algorithm","power system oscillation","power system stabilizer (PSS)","robust control","system uncertainties"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776565","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2014.2308358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2014.2308358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6837545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/6837545/06776565.pdf","startPage":"823","endPage":"833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Robust Control of DFIG Wind Turbine and PSS for Stabilization of Power Oscillations Considering System Uncertainties","abstract":"Uncertainties in power systems, such as intermittent wind power, generating and loading conditions may cause the malfunction of power system stabilizing controllers, which are designed without considering such uncertainties. To enhance the robustness of stabilizing controllers against system uncertainties, this paper proposes a new coordinated robust control of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine equipped with power oscillation damper (POD) and synchronous generator installed with power system stabilizer (PSS) for stabilization of power system oscillations. Without the difficulty of mathematical representation, the inverse output multiplicative perturbation is used to model system uncertainties. The structure of POD and PSS is specified as a practical second-order lead/lag compensator with single input. The parameters optimization of POD and PSS is conducted so that the stabilizing performance and robustness of POD and PSS are augmented. The improved firefly algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem and achieve the POD and PSS parameters automatically. Simulation study in the modified IEEE-39 bus New England system included with DFIG wind turbines ensures that the robustness and stabilizing performance of the proposed coordinated DFIG with POD and PSS are much superior to those of the conventional DFIG with POD and PSS under various severe disturbances and system uncertainties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776565/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6776565/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14396253","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Robust Control of DFIG Wind Turbine and PSS for Stabilization of Power Oscillations Considering System Uncertainties","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Robust Control of DFIG Wind Turbine and PSS for Stabilization of Power Oscillations Considering System Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"tste-ngamroo-2308358-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03496S","chronDate":"July  2014","isNumber":"6837545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"73","articleId":"6776565","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6776566,"authors":[{"name":"Mahardhika Pratama","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University Of New South Wales, Canberra, BC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/7070767/6776566/prata-small.gif","p":["Mahardhika Pratama (M\u201912) was born in Surabaya, Indonesia.

It adopts an open structure and plug and play concept where automatic knowledge building, rule-based simplification, knowledge recall mechanism, and soft feature reduction can be carried out on the fly with limited expert knowledge and without prior assumptions to underlying data distribution. In this paper, three state-of-the-art classifier architectures engaging multi-input-multi-output, multimodel, and round robin architectures are also critically analyzed. The efficacy of the pClass has been numerically validated by means of real-world and synthetic streaming data, possessing various concept drifts, noisy learning environments, and dynamic class attributes. In addition, comparative studies with prominent algorithms using comprehensive statistical tests have confirmed that the pClass delivers more superior performance in terms of classification rate, number of fuzzy rules, and number of rule-base parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776566/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15019711","volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6776566/","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"pClass: An Effective Classifier for Streaming Examples","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FWF","grantNumber":"I328-N23"},{"fundingName":"Austrian COMET-K2 programme"},{"fundingName":"Austrian federal government"},{"fundingName":"Johannes Kepler University"},{"fundingName":"K2-COMET Consortium"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"pClass: An Effective Classifier for Streaming Examples","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-pratama-2312983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117006S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"7070767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7070767","articleId":"6776566","onlineDate":"20 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6776569,"authors":[{"name":"Daksha Yadav","affiliation":["Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6776454/6776569/yadav-2313025-small.gif","p":["Daksha Yadav received the B.Tech. degree in computer science from the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi, India, in 2013.

These uncorrected CFOs destroy the orthogonality among subcarriers, causing inter-carrier interference and multi-user interference, which degrade the system performance severely. In this paper, novel time-domain multi-user interference cancellation schemes for OFDMA uplink are proposed. They employ an architecture with multiple OFDMA-demodulators to compensate for the impacts of multi-user CFOs at the base station's side. Analytical and numerical evaluations show that the proposed schemes achieve a significant performance gain compared to the conventional receiver and a reference frequency-domain multi-user interference cancellation scheme. In a particular scenario, a maximum CFO of up to 40% of the subcarrier spacing can be tolerated, and the CFO-free performance is maintained in the OFDMA uplink.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6776574/06776577.pdf","startPage":"1164","endPage":"1171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.021414.070718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.021414.070718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776574","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-User Interference Cancellation Schemes for Carrier Frequency Offset Compensation in Uplink OFDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","OFDM","Receivers","Interference cancellation","Estimation","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulators","frequency division multiple access","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser interference cancellation schemes","carrier frequency offset compensation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA system","orthogonality","intercarrier interference","multiuser interference","system performance","time-domain multiuser interference cancellation","multiple OFDMA-demodulators","multiuser CFO","base station","performance gain","receiver","reference frequency-domain multiuser interference cancellation","maximum CFO","CFO-free performance","OFDMA uplink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synchronization","OFDMA","uplink","timing offset","frequency offset","multi-user interference cancellation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multi-User Interference Cancellation Schemes for Carrier Frequency Offset Compensation in Uplink OFDMA","volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6776577/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14181457","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-User Interference Cancellation Schemes for Carrier Frequency Offset Compensation in Uplink OFDMA","sourcePdf":"1164-tw1403-huan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161196S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6776577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6776586,"authors":[{"name":"Ashish Bagwari","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, Uttarakhand Technical University, Dehradun, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9754/6776581/6776586/6776586-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ashish Bagwari (M'10) received the B.Tech. and M.Tech.

The first stage consists of multiple energy detectors, where each energy detector (ED) has a single antenna with fixed threshold for making a local binary decision. If required, the second stage comprised of ED with adaptive double threshold is invoked. The detection performance of the proposed scheme is compared with a cyclostationary-based sensing method and adaptive spectrum sensing scheme. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme improves detection performance and outperforms the cyclostationary-based sensing method and adaptive spectrum sensing by 12.3% and 14.4% at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) setting of as low as -8 dB, respectively. Performance was also measured in terms of sensing time and scheme has smaller sensing time than cyclostationary detection and adaptive spectrum sensing scheme in the order of 4.3 and 0.1 ms at -20-dB SNR, respectively. Furthermore, the scheme was analyzed in conjunction with cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), where each cognitive radio (CR) user used two-stage spectrum sensing detectors for local detection and sent detection decisions to the fusion center to give the final decision based on hard decision OR rule. It is further found that the proposed two-stage spectrum sensing scheme with CSS achieves spectrum detection performance in the order of 0.9 for an SNR value of as low as -19 dB as the number of CR users (K) is 10.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Fall  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Fall  2013","volume":"36","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"14182324","publicationDate":"Fall 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776586/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Based on Two-Stage Detectors With Multiple Energy Detectors and Adaptive Double Threshold in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Based on Two-Stage Detectors With Multiple Energy Detectors and Adaptive Double Threshold in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"cjece-bagwari-2303519-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073403S","chronDate":"Fall  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"6776581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6776581","articleId":"6776586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6776589,"authors":[{"name":"Paul de Kerret","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, Eurecom Campus SophiaTech, 450 Route des Chappes, 06410 Biot, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6814382/6776589/6776589-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paul de Kerret graduated in 2009 from Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications de Bretagne, France and obtained a diploma degree in electrical engineering from Munich University of Technology (TUM), Germany.

Incompleteness of CSIT refers to the perfect knowledge at each transmitter (TX) of only a sub-matrix of the global channel matrix, where the sub-matrix is specific to each TX. This paper investigates the notion of IA feasibility for CSIT configurations being as incomplete as possible, as this leads to feedback overhead reductions in practice. We distinguish between antenna configurations where (i) removing a single antenna makes IA unfeasible, referred to as tightly-feasible settings, and (ii) cases where extra antennas are available, referred to as super-feasible settings. We show conditions for which IA is feasible in strictly incomplete CSIT scenarios, even in tightly-feasible settings. For such cases, we provide a CSIT allocation policy preserving IA feasibility while reducing significantly the amount of CSIT required. For super-feasible settings, we develop a heuristic CSIT allocation algorithm which exploits the additional antennas to further reduce the size of the CSIT allocation. As a byproduct of our approach, a simple and intuitive algorithm for testing feasibility of single stream IA is provided.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6814382/06776589.pdf","startPage":"2563","endPage":"2573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.031914.121848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031914.121848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment with Incomplete CSIT Sharing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Resource management","Antennas","Interference","Equations","Nickel","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment","heuristic CSIT allocation algorithm","K-user MIMO interference channel","IC","global channel matrix","feedback overhead reductions","antenna configurations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference alignment","interference channel","channel state information","degrees-of-freedom"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment with Incomplete CSIT Sharing","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6776589/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299551","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment with Incomplete CSIT Sharing","sourcePdf":"2563-tw1405-paul.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095521S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6776589","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6776590,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Che Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6814382/6776590/6776590-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying-Che Hung was born in Taichung, Taiwan, in 1983.

Using beamforming can significantly improve the receive SNR of OFDM systems. However, the combination of transmit signals after beamforming deteriorates the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which has long been considered a major issue of OFDM systems. High PAPR not only complicates the design of the power amplifier, but also increases power consumption. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the PAPR performance of MIMO OFDM systems that adopt either one of the two popular beamforming schemes, i.e. MRT (maximum ratio transmission) and EGT (equal gain transmission). The analysis considers different numbers of channel taps after sampling. The results may provide important reference for practical designs when evaluating the required power amplifiers and power consumption. Moreover, the theoretical results show that MRT OFDM systems generally perform much worse than EGT OFDM systems in terms of PAPR. Furthermore, motivated from the derived results, PAPR reduction algorithms are proposed for both MRT OFDM and EGT OFDM systems. It is worth to mention that for MRT OFDM systems, the proposed algorithm can improve both PAPR and bit error rate; for EGT OFDM systems, the proposed algorithm improves PAPR while it only slightly degrades bit error rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6814382/06776590.pdf","startPage":"2588","endPage":"2600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.031914.130347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031914.130347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Analysis and Mitigation Algorithms for Beamforming MIMO OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Array signal processing","MIMO","Vectors","Baseband","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","signal sampling","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR analysis","mitigation algorithms","beamforming MIMO OFDM system","SNR","peak-to-average power ratio","power amplifier","MRT","maximum ratio transmission","EGT","equal gain transmission","channel taps","sampling","power consumption","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO OFDM","beamforming","precoding","peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR","low power","maximum ratio transmission","MRT","equal gain transmission","EGT","extreme value theory","beta distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Analysis and Mitigation Algorithms for Beamforming MIMO OFDM Systems","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6776590/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299584","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Analysis and Mitigation Algorithms for Beamforming MIMO OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"2588-tw1405-hung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07765S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6776590","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6776591,"authors":[{"name":"Cuong T.

In this paper, we study the pricing effect on the equilibrium behaviors of selfish secondary users' (SUs') data packets which are served by a CR base station (BS). From the SUs' point of view, a spectrum access decision on whether to join the queue of the BS or not is characterized through an individual optimal strategy that is joining the queue with a joining probability. This strategy also requires each SU to know the average queueing delay, which is a non-trivial problem. Toward this end, we provide queueing delay analysis by using the M/G/1 queue with breakdown. From the BS's point of view, we consider a duopoly market based on the two paradigms: the opportunistic dynamic spectrum access (O-DSA) and the mixed O-DSA & dedicated dynamic spectrum access (D-DSA). In the first paradigm, two co-located opportunistic-spectrum BSs utilize freely spectrum-holes to serve SUs. Then, we show the advantages of the cooperative scenario due to the unique solution that can be obtained in a distributed manner by using the dual decomposition algorithms. For the second paradigm, there are one opportunistic-spectrum BS and one dedicated-spectrum BS. We study a price competition between two BSs as a Stackelberg game. The cooperative behavior between two BSs is modeled as a bargaining game. In both paradigms, bargain revenues of the cooperation are always higher than those due to competition in both cases. Extensive numerical analysis is used to validate our derivation.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.031914.131363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6814382/06776591.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031914.131363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"2574","endPage":"2587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Pricing for Duopoly in Cognitive Radio Networks: Cooperate or not Cooperate?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Pricing for Duopoly in Cognitive Radio Networks: Cooperate or not Cooperate?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776591/","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6776591/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299582","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Pricing for Duopoly in Cognitive Radio Networks: Cooperate or not Cooperate?","sourcePdf":"2574-tw1405-do.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201373S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6776591","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6776592,"authors":[{"name":"Ali T.

Therefore, an optimization is needed to find the best tradeoff between latency and power saving. In this paper, we first develop an analytical model to estimate power saving achieved and latency incurred by DRX mechanism for active and background mobile traffic. A tradeoff scheme is then formulated to maintain a balance between these two performance parameters based on operator's preference for power saving and latency requirement of traffic. The analytical model is validated using system level simulation results obtained from OPNET Modeler. The results show that the proposed tradeoff scheme is efficient in keeping a balance between power saving and latency. The results also indicate that DRX short cycles are very effective in reducing latency for active traffic, while shorter inactivity timer is desirable for background traffic to enhance power saving. We also proposed a mechanism to switch DRX configuration based on traffic running at UE, using UE assistance procedure recently adopted by 3GPP in Release 11. DRX configuration switching increases the power saving significantly without any noticeable increase in latency of active traffic.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.031914.131298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6814382/06776592.pdf","startPage":"2614","endPage":"2625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.031914.131298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device Power Saving and Latency Optimization in LTE-A Networks Through DRX Configuration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776592/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Device Power Saving and Latency Optimization in LTE-A Networks Through DRX Configuration","volume":"13","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14299562","htmlLink":"/document/6776592/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device Power Saving and Latency Optimization in LTE-A Networks Through DRX Configuration","sourcePdf":"2614-tw1405-koc.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075386S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6814382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6814382","articleId":"6776592","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6776594,"authors":[{"name":"Donghun Lee","affiliation":["Electronics Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6814382/6776594/6776594-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Donghun Lee received the B.

Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained more attention and successfully applied to process high-dimensional data composed not only of single modality but also of multimodal information. We introduced DNNs to construct multimodal association model which can reconstruct one modality from the other modality. Our model is composed of two DNNs: one for image compression and the other for audio-visual sequential learning. We tried to reproduce synaesthesia phenomenon by training our model with the multimodal data acquired from psychological experiment. Cross-modal association experiment showed that our model can reconstruct the same or similar images from sound as synaesthetes, those who experience synaesthesia.

However, for higher SIR they exhibit differences because the inter-carrier interference is not normally distributed, violating our assumptions.","publicationTitle":"WSA 2014; 18th International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"WSA 2014; 18th International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel7/6776877/6776878/06776902.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit Error Probability for Pilot-Symbol-Aided OFDM Channel Estimation in Doubly-Selective Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776902/","displayDocTitle":"Bit Error Probability for Pilot-Symbol-Aided OFDM Channel Estimation in Doubly-Selective Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","conferenceDate":"12-13 March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit Error Probability for Pilot-Symbol-Aided OFDM Channel Estimation in Doubly-Selective Channels","confLoc":"Erlangen, Germany","sourcePdf":"453584024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028733S","chronDate":"12-13 March 2014","isNumber":"6776878","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6776877","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6776902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6776914,"authors":[{"name":"Baskaran Anand","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Baskaran","lastName":"Anand","id":"37085508386"},{"name":"Indoria Aakash","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Indoria","lastName":"Aakash","id":"37086720263"},{"name":"Akshay","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita University, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"lastName":"Akshay","id":"37086720952"},{"name":"Varatharajan Varrun","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Varatharajan","lastName":"Varrun","id":"37086721758"},{"name":"Murali Krishna Reddy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Murali Krishna","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37086719222"},{"name":"Tejaswi Sathyasai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"Tejaswi","lastName":"Sathyasai","id":"37086717437"},{"name":"M.

It provides an efficient technique to obtain the best optimized result in the search space. This algorithm ensures a faster rate of convergence to the desired solution whose precision can be preset by the user. The inertia parameter is varied linearly with iteration number, which results in more accurate solution for unimodal functions. The control over the precision value acts as a trade-off between the convergence time and precision of the desired solution, and it can be viewed as a performance parameter. Swarm convergence is followed by a mutation process, which further improves the obtained result by enhancing the local search ability of some particles. The results show that the solution with predefined precision level can be obtained with the minimum number of iterations.","doi":"10.1109/SPIN.2014.6776914","startPage":"20","endPage":"24","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766412/6776904/06776914.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2014.6776914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvisation of particle swarm optimization algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Signal processing algorithms","Convergence","Accuracy","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","iterative methods","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization algorithm improvisation","PSO algorithm","convergence rate","inertia parameter","iteration number","convergence time","performance parameter","swarm convergence","mutation process","local search ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","Swarm Intelligence","Global Optimization","Mutation","Swarm Convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Improvisation of particle swarm optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776914/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","conferenceDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14198397","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvisation of particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077932S","chronDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766412","isNumber":"6776904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766412","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6776904","articleId":"6776914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6776916,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The algorithms are implemented using Matlab and the performance evaluation are done based on average relative error in recovery and the probability of error in signal support. The results of the experimental evaluation using generic sparse data are presented.

Godard's Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) was the very first blind equalization algorithm that could be used in two dimensional digital communication systems. It requires the knowledge of statistical properties of the transmitted data symbols to perform channel equalization. Picchi and Prati by modifying the standard Decision-Directed Algorithm proposed a new Blind Equalization Algorithm known as \"Stop-and-Go\" Decision-Directed Algorithm.

This underutilized spectrum causes hurdle in implementation of emerging wireless technologies which require more frequency spectrum. Cognitive radio (CR) has provided a promising solution to the current spectral requirement problem by efficient spectrum sharing. Spectrum sensing (SS) is one of the key feature that has to be performed in CR networks. Many SS techniques are present based upon different parameters in the past. Among these technique, radiometric detection uses a general purpose method that can be used in all condition in spite of signal structure and signal type. But, the performance of radiometric detection scheme is greatly degraded especially in low signal to noise ratio (SNR) environments. In those situation, an appropriate setting of the detection threshold could lead to a significant improvement in detection scheme. In this paper, new scheme for radiometric detection has been proposed for low SNR environment. Simulation result shows improved performance over conventional scheme in low SNR environment.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2014.6776971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776904","startPage":"322","endPage":"326","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766412/6776904/06776971.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low SNR radiometric detection in cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6776971/","displayDocTitle":"Low SNR radiometric detection in cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14198341","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low SNR radiometric detection in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063453S","chronDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766412","isNumber":"6776904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766412","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6776904","articleId":"6776971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6776973,"authors":[{"name":"Mona Aggarwal","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Dwarka, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Mona","lastName":"Aggarwal","id":"37085343277"},{"name":"Parul Garg","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Dwarka, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Parul","lastName":"Garg","id":"37397967000"},{"name":"Parul Puri","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Dwarka, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Parul","lastName":"Puri","id":"37085351111"},{"name":"Prabhat Kumar Sharma","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Dwarka, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Prabhat Kumar","lastName":"Sharma","id":"38546977100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2866-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2865-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6776973","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":312},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776973","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Optical fiber communication","Optical refraction","Optical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","error statistics","optical communication","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical wireless communication system","dual-hop OWC system","relay-assisted link","decode and forward relaying protocol","atmospheric turbulence channels","gamma-gamma fading statistics","exact closed form expressions","outage probability","average bit-error rate","power series representations","modified Bessel function","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atmospheric turbulence","bit-error rate (BER)","decode and forward","optical wireless communication (OWC) systems"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the performance of the cooperative optical wireless communication (OWC) systems under the effect of atmospheric turbulence.

The quality of services (QoS) means acceptable data transfer rate, signal to noise ratio (SNR), and bit error rate (BER). It can be achieved by management of resources in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system. The main issue in OFDMA systems is allocation of sub-carriers and power among different types of users. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for heterogeneous users in OFDMA system. Two different types of users are considered on the basis of required quality of services that is sensitive user (SU) and general user (GU). While the priority is given to the sensitive users, some resources are also allocated to general users to keep the system fair. The complexity of algorithm is also a major issue and it can be reduced by allocation of subcarrier and power sequentially. The water-filling method applies for power allocation among users in SU category and equal power distribution among the users in GU category to avoid the calculation burden of CPU.","doi":"10.1109/SPIN.2014.6776987","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766412/6776904/06776987.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2014.6776987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fair adaptive resource allocation algorithm for heterogeneous users in OFDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776987/","displayDocTitle":"Fair adaptive resource allocation algorithm for heterogeneous users in OFDMA system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14198345","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776987/","conferenceDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair adaptive resource allocation algorithm for heterogeneous users in OFDMA system","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122883S","chronDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766412","isNumber":"6776904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766412","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6776904","articleId":"6776987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6776995,"authors":[{"name":"Mayur Agarwal","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Electrical Communication Engg, IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Mayur","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37086314555"},{"name":"Neha Agrawal","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication AI-Falah, Faridabad, India"],"firstName":"Neha","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37086647509"},{"name":"Md.

The algorithm requires only shift and add operations and this simplicity encourages its implementation in hardware. Traditional CORDIC architectures have focused on radix-2 implementations because of their higher accuracy. However these architectures are slow, requiring a lot of iterations to converge to a given solution. Radix-4 and higher radix architectures have been proposed to speed up the process by reducing the number of iterations, but they suffer from poor accuracy. In this paper a hybrid-radix approach to CORDIC implementation is proposed. By using this approach the algorithm can be implemented with higher speed, lower power and lesser area utilization and at the same time a good accuracy can be achieved. Further the hybrid-radix architecture has been retimed resulting in an increase in the overall throughput which is particularly important in DSP applications.","doi":"10.1109/SPIN.2014.6776996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2014.6776996","startPage":"453","endPage":"457","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766412/6776904/06776996.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid-radix approach for efficient implementation of unfolded CORDIC architectures for FPGA platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid-radix approach for efficient implementation of unfolded CORDIC architectures for FPGA platforms","conferenceDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776996/","accessionNumber":"14198424","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776996/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid-radix approach for efficient implementation of unfolded CORDIC architectures for FPGA platforms","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077063S","chronDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766412","isNumber":"6776904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766412","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6776904","articleId":"6776996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6776998,"authors":[{"name":"Durga Digdarsini","affiliation":["Space Applications Centre (SAC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Durga","lastName":"Digdarsini","id":"37085856494"},{"name":"Mahesh Kumar","affiliation":["Space Applications Centre (SAC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Mahesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085816127"},{"name":"Gopichand Khot","affiliation":["Space Applications Centre (SAC), Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Gopichand","lastName":"Khot","id":"37398686400"},{"name":"T.

A wavelet transform based algorithm which involves multi-rate signal processing, is realizedto distinguish QAM, PSK and FSK digital modulation signal in noisy environment. The approach is to use wavelet transform to extract the transient characteristics ina digital modulation signal to identify the type of modulation. The optimum thresholds are derivedfrom rigorous simulation in MATLAB/Simulinkunder the condition that the input noise is Additive WhiteGaussian (AWGN). The performance of the identification schemeis investigated through simulations. The design is implemented and tested in Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA based card.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766412/6776904/06776998.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"469","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","doi":"10.1109/SPIN.2014.6776998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN.2014.6776998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6776998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of automatic modulation recognition system for advanced SATCOM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Frequency shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","field programmable gate arrays","frequency shift keying","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","satellite communication","software radio","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA","AWGN","additive white Gaussian","MATLAB/Simulink","wavelet transform","noisy environment","FSK digital modulation signal","PSK digital modulation signal","QAM digital modulation signal","multirate signal processing","AMR algorithm","SDR","software defined radio","digital modulation type","automatic identification","advanced SATCOM system","automatic modulation recognition system","FPGA implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AMR","PSK","FSK","QAM","SDR","AWGN","FPGA","Wavelet","Multi-Rate signal Processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6776998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of automatic modulation recognition system for advanced SATCOM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6776998/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14198439","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","conferenceDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of automatic modulation recognition system for advanced SATCOM system","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054449S","chronDate":"20-21 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766412","isNumber":"6776904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766412","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6776904","articleId":"6776998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6777030,"authors":[{"name":"Kunja Bihari Swain","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand"],"firstName":"Kunja Bihari","lastName":"Swain","id":"37086656747"},{"name":"S.

The model includes several new algorithms for analyzing graphic designs, including the prediction of perceived importance, alignment detection, and hierarchical segmentation. Given the model, we use optimization to synthesize new layouts for a variety of single-page graphic designs.

The focus of this paper is the pose problem which remains largely overlooked in most real-world applications. Specifically, we focus on one-to-one matching scenarios where a query face image of a random pose is matched against a set of gallery images. We propose a method that relies on two fundamental components: (a) A 3D modeling step to geometrically correct the viewpoint of the face. For this purpose, we extend a recent technique for efficient synthesis of 3D face models called 3D Generic Elastic Model. (b) A sparse feature extraction step using subspace modeling and \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-minimization to induce pose-tolerance in coefficient space. This in return enables the synthesis of an equivalent frontal-looking face, which can be used towards recognition. We show significant performance improvements in verification rates compared to commercial matchers, and also demonstrate the resilience of the proposed method with respect to degrading input quality. We find that the proposed technique is able to match non-frontal images to other non-frontal images of varying angles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Feature Extraction for Pose-Tolerant Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2313124","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6889065/06777283.pdf","startPage":"2061","endPage":"2073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2313124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6889065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Feature Extraction for Pose-Tolerant Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6777283/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14564278","pubMedId":"26352635","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Feature Extraction for Pose-Tolerant Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tpami-prabhu-2313124-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075992S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6889065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6889065","articleId":"6777283","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6777291,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6949175/6777291/liu-2313180-small.gif","p":["\nWei Liu (M'07) received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering\nand the Ph.D. degree in electronics and information engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology,\nWuhan, China, in 1999 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong\nUniversity of Science and Technology.

A major requirement on the network is the ability to provide unidentifiability and unlinkability for mobile nodes and their traffic. Although a number of anonymous secure routing protocols have been proposed, the requirement is not fully satisfied. The existing protocols are vulnerable to the attacks of fake routing packets or denial-of-service broadcasting, even the node identities are protected by pseudonyms. In this paper, we propose a new routing protocol, i.e., authenticated anonymous secure routing (AASR), to satisfy the requirement and defend against the attacks. More specifically, the route request packets are authenticated by a group signature, to defend against potential active attacks without unveiling the node identities. The key-encrypted onion routing with a route secret verification message is designed to prevent intermediate nodes from inferring a real destination. Simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed AASR protocol with improved performance as compared with the existing protocols.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2313180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06777291.pdf","startPage":"4585","endPage":"4593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2313180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AASR: Authenticated Anonymous Secure Routing for MANETs in Adversarial Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"AASR: Authenticated Anonymous Secure Routing for MANETs in Adversarial Environments","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6777291/","accessionNumber":"14735156","volume":"63","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371080 and 61301127"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AASR: Authenticated Anonymous Secure Routing for MANETs in Adversarial Environments","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-2313180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072628S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6777291","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6777295,"authors":[{"name":"Junil Choi","affiliation":["Purdue University, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Lafayette, IN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6895322/6777295/6777295-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Junil Choi (S'12) received his B.S.

Most literature on massive MIMO systems assumes time division duplexing (TDD), although frequency division duplexing (FDD) dominates current cellular systems. Due to the large number of transmit antennas at the base station, currently standardized approaches would require a large percentage of the precious downlink and uplink resources in FDD massive MIMO be used for training signal transmissions and channel state information (CSI) feedback. To reduce the overhead of the downlink training phase, we propose practical open-loop and closed-loop training frameworks in this paper. We assume the base station and the user share a common set of training signals in advance. In open-loop training, the base station transmits training signals in a round-robin manner, and the user successively estimates the current channel using long-term channel statistics such as temporal and spatial correlations and previous channel estimates. In closed-loop training, the user feeds back the best training signal to be sent in the future based on channel prediction and the previously received training signals. With a small amount of feedback from the user to the base station, closed-loop training offers better performance in the data communication phase, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, the number of transmit antennas is large, or prior channel estimates are not accurate at the beginning of the communication setup, all of which would be mostly beneficial for massive MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2313020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2313020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6895322/06777295.pdf","startPage":"802","endPage":"814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Training Techniques for FDD Massive MIMO Systems: Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Training With Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Training Techniques for FDD Massive MIMO Systems: Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Training With Memory","volume":"8","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777295/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581793","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777295/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Training Techniques for FDD Massive MIMO Systems: Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Training With Memory","sourcePdf":"jstsp-choi-2313020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088977S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6895322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"307","xplore-issue":"6895322","articleId":"6777295","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6777298,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Quesada-Barriuso","affiliation":["Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Tecnolox\u00edas da Informaci\u00f3n, University of Santiago de Compostela, R\u00faa de Jenaro de la Fuente Dom\u00ednguez, Santiago de Compostela, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Quesada-Barriuso","id":"38468585900"},{"name":"Francisco Arg\u00fcello","affiliation":["Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Tecnolox\u00edas da Informaci\u00f3n, University of Santiago de Compostela, R\u00faa de Jenaro de la Fuente Dom\u00ednguez, Santiago de Compostela, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Arg\u00fcello","id":"37352465100"},{"name":"Dora B.

The first part of the paper is of a tutorial nature, addressing recent advances in cognitive perception and cognitive control, which are the dual of each other. The study of cognitive perception, viewed from the perspective of Bayesian inference, starts with sparse coding, well known in neuroscience. However, sparse coding could become ill-posed, particularly when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In such situations, stability is a necessary requirement, which can only be satisfied if there is sufficient information in the observables. To satisfy this requirement, the sparse-coding algorithm is augmented by the addition of information filtering (i.e., a special case of Bayesian filtering). Accordingly, the performance of sparse coding is improved under the influence of perceptual attention. This improvement enhances the cognitive perceptor to separate relevant information from irrelevant information. Next, moving into cognitive control, viewed from the perspective of Bellman's dynamic programming, two ideas are exploited: entropic state of the perceptor, and the definition of reward as an invertible function of two entropic states, namely, the current state and its immediate past value. The net result of building on these two ideas is a modified form of Bellman's dynamic programming, and, therefore, a new reinforcement learning algorithm, which not only outperforms traditional reinforcement learning algorithms, but also offers some highly desirable properties. Among them is a linear law of computational complexity, which is the best that it could be. The second part of the paper addresses two challenging problems: first, how to mediate between cognitive control and cognitive perception and, second, how to formulate a procedure for risk control. The first problem is resolved by making use of probabilistic reasoning, a branch of probability theory, which leads into the formulation of a probabilistic reasoning machine. With this mediation in place, the conditions for overall system stability are derived, thereby confirming the probabilistic reasoning machine as the overall system stabilizer. The second challenge is risk control, which is by far the most challenging of them all: In the presence of an unexpected disturbance in the environment, risk is brought under control by mimicking the predict and preadapt function, which is considered to be the overarching function in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. To be specific, motor control is expanded by the inclusion of a new preadaptive control mechanism, which involves two different sets of actions: One set is made up of possible actions identified by the policy in the motor control. The other set involves a window of experiences (i.e., optimal actions) gained in the past. In a novel way, by exploiting these two sets, we end up with a preadaptive control mechanism in the form of a closed-loop feedback structure, which brings with it control (executive) attention.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Cognitive Dynamic Systems: Cognitive Neuroscience and Engineering Learning From Each Other","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2014.2311211","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/6777968/06777299.pdf","startPage":"608","endPage":"628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2014.2311211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777968","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777299","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"On Cognitive Dynamic Systems: Cognitive Neuroscience and Engineering Learning From Each Other","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"102","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6777299/","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14196386","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Cognitive Dynamic Systems: Cognitive Neuroscience and Engineering Learning From Each Other","sourcePdf":"jproc-haykin-2311211-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092133S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6777968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6777968","articleId":"6777299","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6777300,"authors":[{"name":"Tuba Yilmaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah StateUniversity, Logan, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6823189/6777300/6777300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tuba Yilmaz (S'12) received the B.S. degree from Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2007, the M.S. degree from Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering and computer science from Queen Mary, University of London, London, U.K., in 2013.","Currently, she is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Power Electronics Laboratory at Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA.

It was observed that the input impedance of the resonator is sensitive to the changes in the dielectric properties and, hence, to the realistic glucose level changes in the blood layer.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6823189/06777300.pdf","startPage":"3064","endPage":"3075","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2313139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2313139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband Tissue Mimicking Phantoms and a Patch Resonator for Evaluating Noninvasive Monitoring of Blood Glucose Levels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Tissue Mimicking Phantoms and a Patch Resonator for Evaluating Noninvasive Monitoring of Blood Glucose Levels","htmlLink":"/document/6777300/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14362316","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Tissue Mimicking Phantoms and a Patch Resonator for Evaluating Noninvasive Monitoring of Blood Glucose Levels","sourcePdf":"tap-hao-2313139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065515S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6823189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6823189","articleId":"6777300","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6777301,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico M.

In this work, we propose-to the best of our knowledge-the first VLSI design enabling high-throughput data detection in single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA)-based large-scale MIMO systems. We propose a new approximate matrix inversion algorithm relying on a Neumann series expansion, which substantially reduces the complexity of linear data detection. We analyze the associated error, and we compare its performance and complexity to those of an exact linear detector. We present corresponding VLSI architectures, which perform exact and approximate soft-output detection for large-scale MIMO systems with various antenna/user configurations. Reference implementation results for a Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX980T FPGA show that our designs are able to achieve more than 600 Mb/s for a 128 antenna, 8 user 3GPP LTE-based large-scale MIMO system. We finally provide a performance/complexity trade-off comparison using the presented FPGA designs, which reveals that the detector circuit of choice is determined by the ratio between BS antennas and users, as well as the desired error-rate performance.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2313021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2313021","startPage":"916","endPage":"929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6895322/06777306.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale MIMO Detection for 3GPP LTE: Algorithms and FPGA Implementations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale MIMO Detection for 3GPP LTE: Algorithms and FPGA Implementations","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14581791","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6777306/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1265332, ECCS-1232274, EECS-0925942 and CNS-0923479"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale MIMO Detection for 3GPP LTE: Algorithms and FPGA Implementations","sourcePdf":"jstsp-studer-2313021-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192988S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6895322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"242","xplore-issue":"6895322","articleId":"6777306","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6777313,"authors":[{"name":"Aly El Gamal","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Aly El Gamal (S'09) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from Cairo University, Cairo, in 2007, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nile University, Cairo, in 2009, the M.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in 2013, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.","He worked as an intern in the Office of the Chief Scientist Department of Qualcomm Inc., in 2012.

In this paper, the capacity gain achieved through CoMP transmission is studied in various models of wireless networks that have practical significance. The capacity gain is analyzed through the degrees of freedom (DoF) criterion. The DoF available for communication provides an analytically tractable way to characterize the capacity of interference channels. The considered channel model has K transmitter/receiver pairs, and each receiver is interested in one unique message from a set of K independent messages. Each message can be available at more than one transmitter. The maximum number of transmitters at which each message can be available, is defined as the cooperation order M. For fully connected interference channels, it is shown that the asymptotic per user DoF, as K goes to infinity, remains at 1/2 as M is increased from 1 to 2. Furthermore, the same negative result is shown to hold for all M \u2265 2 for any message assignment that satisfies a local cooperation constraint. On the other hand, when the assumption of full connectivity is relaxed to local connectivity, and each transmitter is connected only to its own receiver as well as L neighboring receivers, it is shown that local cooperation is optimal. The asymptotic per user DoF is shown to be at least max {1/2, 2M/(2M + L)} for locally connected channels, and is shown to be 2M/(2M + 1) for the special case of Wyner's asymmetric model where L = 1. An interesting feature of the proposed achievability scheme is that it relies on simple zero-forcing transmit beams and does not require symbol extensions. Also, to achieve the optimal per user DoF for Wyner's model, messages are assigned to transmitters in an asymmetric fashion unlike traditional assignments where message i has to be available at transmitter i. It is also worth noting that some receivers have to be inactive, and fractional reuse is needed to achieve equal DoF for all users.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6816018/06777313.pdf","startPage":"3483","endPage":"3498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2313083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2313083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816018","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Channels With Coordinated Multipoint Transmission: Degrees of Freedom, Message Assignment, and Fractional Reuse","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Channel models","Radio transmitters","Interference channels","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","next generation networks","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference channel capacity","coordinated multipoint transmission","degrees of freedom","message assignment","fractional reuse","CoMP transmission","next generation wireless networks","capacity gain","DoF criterion","K transmitter-receiver pairs","channel model","K independent messages","local cooperation constraint","Wyner asymmetric model","zero-forcing transmit beams","L neighboring receivers"]},{"kwd":["CoMP Transmission","interference-aware backhaul design","irreducible message assignments","locally connected channels","zero-forcing transmit beam-forming","interference avoidance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Interference Channels With Coordinated Multipoint Transmission: Degrees of Freedom, Message Assignment, and Fractional Reuse","volume":"60","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6777313/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14301811","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF under Award CCF-0904619 through the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"},{"fundingName":"Intel and Motorola Solutions"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Channels With Coordinated Multipoint Transmission: Degrees of Freedom, Message Assignment, and Fractional Reuse","sourcePdf":"tit-veeravalli-2313083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211855S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6816018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6816018","articleId":"6777313","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6777323,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Kiouseloglou","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, Grenoble Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6802373/6777323/kious-2310497-small.gif","p":["Athanasios Kiouseloglou (S'14) received the Electrical and Computer Engineering degree from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2012.

We cast the problem as mapping high-dimensional eye image features to low-dimensional gaze positions, and propose an adaptive linear regression (ALR) method as the key to our solution. The ALR method adaptively selects an optimal set of sparsest training samples for the gaze estimation via \u2113\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n-optimization. In this sense, the number of required training samples is significantly reduced for high accuracy estimation. In addition, by adopting the basic ALR objective function, we integrate the gaze estimation, subpixel alignment and blink detection into a unified optimization framework. By solving these problems simultaneously, we successfully handle slight head motion, image resolution variation and eye blinking in appearance-based gaze estimation. We evaluated the proposed method by conducting experiments with multiple users and variant conditions to verify its effectiveness.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6889065/06777326.pdf","startPage":"2033","endPage":"2046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2313123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2313123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6889065","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Linear Regression for Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Head","Feature extraction","Estimation","Training","Magnetic heads","Accuracy","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","gaze tracking","image motion analysis","image resolution","optimisation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive linear regression","ALR method","appearance-based gaze estimation","eye image features","\u21131-optimization","subpixel alignment","blink detection","slight head motion","image resolution variation","eye blinking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eye","gaze estimation","face and gesture recognition","sub-pixel alignment","blink detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Linear Regression for Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation","volume":"36","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6777326/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14564279","pubMedId":"26352633","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Linear Regression for Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation","sourcePdf":"tpami-lu-2313123-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100188S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6889065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6889065","articleId":"6777326","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6777328,"authors":[{"name":"Kristopher Buchanan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6823189/6777328/6777328-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kristopher Buchanan (S\u201907) received B.S. degrees in both electrical engineering and computer engineering in 2009 (magna cum laude) from the University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV, USA, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D degree in the same major.","Since November 2003, he has been a member of the Army National Guard and currently holds the rank of 1st LT, and from 2012\u20132013, he was deployed to Afghanistan on a Quick Reaction Force Security Forces Advisory Team and served as the signal combat advisor in Support of OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM.

However, if sleep time is not properly scheduled, significant delays can occur, which is undesirable in delay-constrained applications. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient sleep-scheduling protocol for maximizing the sleep time lengths of each node while satisfying the delay constraints. We first consider the single-user case and present the basic steps that the node takes to decide when and how long it can sleep. For the multiuser scenario, to mitigate channel contention in packet downloading after sleeping, the sleep schedules requested by the nodes are coordinated by the access point (AP) to avoid overlapping active epochs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sleep-scheduling algorithm achieves lower loss rate while achieving higher energy efficiency than that of the existing GreenCall method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jun 2014","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14379475","htmlLink":"/document/6777330/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Sleep Scheduling for Delay-Constrained Applications Over WLANs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1053777 and CNS-1320736"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Sleep Scheduling for Delay-Constrained Applications Over WLANs","sourcePdf":"tvt-cao-2313114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070907S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6777330","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6777339,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Darwish","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/6936952/6777339/darwi-2313185-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Darwish received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.

The main feature of the proposed topology is that the energy storage elements, such as inductors and capacitors, can be reduced in order to improve the reliability, and reduce size and total cost. The buck-boost inherent characteristic of the Cuk converter, depending on the time-varying duty ratio, provides flexibility for standalone and grid connected applications when the required output ac voltage is lower or greater than the dc side voltage. This property is not found in the conventional current source inverter when the dc input current is always greater than the ac output or in the conventional voltage source inverter as the output ac voltage is always lower than the dc input. The proposed system allows much smaller, more reliable nonelectrolytic capacitors to be used for energy source filtering. The new three-phase inverter is convenient for photovoltaic applications where continuous input currents are required for maximum power point tracking operation. Average large and small signal models are used to study the Cuk converter's nonlinear operation. The basic structure, control design, and MATLAB/SIMULINK results are presented.

Due to the multihop transmission of network-layer handoff signaling packets, handoff performance in WMNs can be largely degraded by the increasing number of wireless hops as well as the channel access contentions between data and signaling packets in the mesh backbone. However, these issues are ignored in existing handoff solutions and multichannel medium-access control schemes. In this paper, we address the seamless handoff support from a different perspective and propose a gateway scheduling-based (GaS) beamforming scheme for handoff support in single-radio multichannel multihop WMNs. Our proposed beamforming scheme can realize single-hop handoff signaling packet transmissions and eliminate the channel contentions between data and signaling packets. Simulation results show that the total handoff delay is significantly improved using our proposed GaS beamforming scheme under various scenarios, as compared with existing handoff solutions in multihop WMNs. In addition, due to the single-hop transmission of signaling packets, the signaling overhead in the wireless mesh backbone can be substantially reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","volume":"63","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"14735184","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777343/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"GaS: A Gateway Scheduling-Based Beamforming Scheme for Handoff Support in Wireless Mesh Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"0855200, 0915599, 0953644,  1218751 and 1343355"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaS: A Gateway Scheduling-Based Beamforming Scheme for Handoff Support in Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-xie-2313144-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090828S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6777343","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6777392,"authors":[{"name":"Marie Zwingelstein-Colin","affiliation":["Gif sur Yvette, SUPELEC - Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio, France"],"firstName":"Marie","lastName":"Zwingelstein-Colin","id":"38271056300"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Gif sur Yvette, SUPELEC - Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6777392","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Automatic repeat request","MIMO","Covariance matrices","Correlation","Approximation methods","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","automatic repeat request","covariance matrices","feedback","MIMO communication","optimisation","resource allocation","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random matrix theory","resource allocation","correlated MIMO systems","ARQ feedback","partial feedback","spatially correlated MIMO link","ARQ protocol","MAC layer","design framework","RMT based approximation","covariance matrix","positive-negative acknowledgment bits","ACK-NAK","asymptotic optimization analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","resource allocation","random matrix theory","ARQ","partial feedback"]}],"abstract":"We consider resource allocation under partial feedback in a spatially correlated MIMO link, when the ARQ protocol is implemented at the MAC layer.

In order to make the algorithm suitable for the multi-cell network with a large number of remote radio heads (RRHs), a low complexity robust design is proposed based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Exploiting the elegant properties of ADMM algorithm, the complicated relationship between the optimization objective and the per-antenna power constraint is decoupled by introducing an auxiliary variable. Meanwhile the complexity of the proposed algorithm is also significantly reduced.

In this letter, a symbol scaling technique is proposed for spatial modulation in the multiple-input-single-output (MISO) channel that enhances this minimum distance. It achieves this by aligning the phase of the relevant channels so that the received symbol phases are distributed in uniformly spaced angles in the received SM constellation. In contrast to existing amplitude-phase scaling schemes that are data-dependent and involve an increase in the transmitted signal power for ill conditioned channels, here a phase-only shift is applied. This allows for data-independent, fixed per-antenna scaling and leaves the symbol power unchanged. The results show an improved SM performance and diversity for the proposed scheme compared to existing amplitude-phase scaling techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777399/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","volume":"18","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14318796","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6777399/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Diversity of Spatial Modulation in MISO Channels by Phase Alignment","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Improving the Diversity of Spatial Modulation in MISO Channels by Phase Alignment","sourcePdf":"729-cl1405-masouros.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0671S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6818356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6818356","articleId":"6777399","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6777400,"authors":[{"name":"Chengjun Tang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chengjun","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085650326"},{"name":"Hong Shen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Shen","id":"38239554000"},{"name":"Ming Jiang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37287359500"},{"name":"Chunming Zhao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Lab., Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chunming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37287523600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6777400","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":402},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Labeling","Optimization","Complexity theory","Bit error rate","Interleaved codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved codes","optimisation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized VDMM framework","protograph-based LDPC coded BICM","generalized variable degree matched mapping framework","bit-interleaved coded modulation systems","deploying protograph-based low-density parity-check codes","optimal G-VDMM scheme","extrinsic information transfer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BICM","EXIT","P-LDPC","bit interleaving"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777400","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6818356/06777400.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.030914.132509","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.030914.132509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6818356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Generalized VDMM for Protograph-Based LDPC Coded BICM","abstract":"In this letter, we develop a generalized variable degree matched mapping (G-VDMM) framework to accommodate any protograph structure and modulation order in bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems deploying protograph-based low-density parity-check (P-LDPC) codes.

The problem is formulated as joint AS and transmit covariance matrix design optimization problem which maximizes the achievable rate from the transmitter to the information-decoding receiver subject to the energy-harvesting constraint and the transmit power constraint. To solve the problem, we relax the binary constraints on the AS matrices and restrict the transmit covariance matrix to be diagonal. The AS matrices and the transmit covariance matrix are optimized iteratively by our proposed iterative AS algorithm. We also propose a low-complexity non-iterative norm-based algorithm which optimizes the AS matrices and the transmit covariance matrix sequentially. It is shown from simulation results that the achievable rates of proposed algorithms approach that of the AS scheme which is optimized by exhaustive search.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.031514.140136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6818356/06777403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.031514.140136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6818356","startPage":"789","endPage":"792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Selection for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer in MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Selection for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer in MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14318784","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6777403/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna Selection for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer in MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"789-cl1405-zhao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046389S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6818356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6818356","articleId":"6777403","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6777406,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Niu","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Institute of Industrial Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Niu","id":"37404786800"},{"name":"Masayuki Iwai","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Institute of Industrial Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Iwai","id":"37394737800"},{"name":"Kaoru Sezaki","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Institute of Industrial Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kaoru","lastName":"Sezaki","id":"37283196800"},{"name":"Li Sun","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Sun","id":"38489339400"},{"name":"Qinghe Du","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qinghe","lastName":"Du","id":"37267188400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6777406","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":917},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Communication system security","Fading","Physical layer","Security","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","fading channels","power control","radio receivers","source coding","telecommunication control","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fountain codes","secure wireless delivery","secure delivery scheme","fountain-coded transmission","receivers","independent channel fading","packet reception rate","eavesdropper","power control","destination channel","fountain-coded transmission","source-destination channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secure wireless delivery","fountain codes","physical layer security","transmit power control"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a secure delivery scheme that exploits fountain codes is analyzed. For fountain-coded transmission, the receivers have to obtain a sufficient number of fountain packets to recover the original data. Secure delivery can be achieved if the legitimate user receives enough fountain packets first. For this purpose, we utilize the independent channel fading of different users to ensure a higher packet reception rate at the destination. The channel fading is competent if the destination is known to have a better average channel condition than that of the eavesdropper; otherwise, transmit power control relative to the destination channel is employed. Numerical results show that the intercept probability is reduced to zero exponentially as the number of source packets increases. Moreover, due to the ordinary fountain-coded transmission, the achievable data rate of the delivery depends only on the source-destination channel capacity rather than the system secrecy capacity.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.030914.140030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6818356/06777406.pdf","startPage":"777","endPage":"780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.030914.140030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6818356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Fountain Codes for Secure Wireless Delivery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777406/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Fountain Codes for Secure Wireless Delivery","volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14318783","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777406/","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Fountain Codes for Secure Wireless Delivery","sourcePdf":"777-cl1405-niu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056786S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6818356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6818356","articleId":"6777406","onlineDate":"21 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6777517,"authors":[{"name":"Dabo Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dabo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37309476800"},{"name":"Yiguang Hong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Systems and Control, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yiguang","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276996700"},{"name":"Xinghu Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Systems and Control, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinghu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37077730100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6777517","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1283},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-agent systems","Indexes","Mathematical model","Regulators","Lead","Nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov methods","multi-agent systems","nonlinear dynamical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed output regulation","nonlinear multiagent systems","host internal model","h-IM","interaction digraph","directed spanning tree","constructive Lyapunov protocol","FitzHugh-Nagumo","FHN","Lorenz type nonlinear dynamic networks"]},{"kwd":["Consensus","distributed control","multi-agent systems","output regulation"]}],"abstract":"This note presents a host internal model (h-IM) approach to distributed output regulation of reaching nonlinear leader-following consensus.

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the existing visualization methods used in evolutionary multiobjective optimization, showing their outcomes on two novel 4-D benchmark approximation sets. In addition, a visualization method that uses prosection (projection of a section) to visualize 4-D approximation sets is proposed. The method reproduces the shape, range, and distribution of vectors in the observed approximation sets well and can handle multiple large approximation sets while being robust and computationally inexpensive. Even more importantly, for some vectors, the visualization with prosections preserves the Pareto dominance relation and relative closeness to reference points. The method is analyzed theoretically and demonstrated on several approximation sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15019517","htmlLink":"/document/6777535/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Visualization of Pareto Front Approximations in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization: A Critical Review and the Prosection Method","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"research program P2-0209"},{"fundingName":"research projects L2-3651 and J2-4120, all funded by the Slovenian Research Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Visualization of Pareto Front Approximations in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization: A Critical Review and the Prosection Method","sourcePdf":"tevc-tusar-2313407-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10298S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"7070844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"7070844","articleId":"6777535","onlineDate":"24 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6777538,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Chen","affiliation":["School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6949175/6777538/hchen-2313458-small.gif","p":["\nHao Chen (S'11) received the B.Eng. degree in automatic control from\nNational University of Defense Technology, Changsa, China, in 2006 and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in control\nsystems from the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 2009.

Our proposed algorithm is referred to as the online mixture of Gaussian-estimator-aided MBER (OMG-MBER) equalizer. Specifically, a mixture of Gaussian-based probability density function (pdf) estimator is used to model the pdf of the decision variable, for which a novel online pdf update algorithm is derived to track the incoming data. With the aid of this novel online mixture of Gaussian-based sample-by-sample updated pdf estimator, our adaptive nonlinear equalizer is capable of updating its equalizer's parameters sample by sample to aim directly at minimizing the RBF nonlinear equalizer's achievable bit error rate (BER). The proposed OMG-MBER equalizer significantly outperforms the existing online nonlinear MBER equalizer, known as the least bit error rate equalizer, in terms of both the convergence speed and the achievable BER, as is confirmed in our simulation study.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Kernel","Probability density function","Bit error rate","Vectors","Least squares approximations","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","error statistics","estimation theory","Gaussian processes","radial basis function networks","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive nonlinear equalizer","radial basis function model","RBF model","minimum bit error rate criterion","interference channel","cochannel interference","CCI","Gaussian-estimator-aided MBER","OMG-MBER equalizer","probability density function","Gaussian-based sample-by-sample updated pdf estimator","convergence speed","pdf estimator","MBER criterion"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive nonlinear equalizer","minimum bit error rate (MBER)","mixture of Gaussians","probability density function (pdf)","radial basis function (RBF)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2313458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06777538.pdf","startPage":"4265","endPage":"4276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2313458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Nonlinear Equalizer Using a Mixture of Gaussian-Based Online Density Estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Nonlinear Equalizer Using a Mixture of Gaussian-Based Online Density Estimator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777538/","volume":"63","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777538/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14735159","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010418","fundingName":"Defence Science and Technology Laboratory","grantNumber":"EP/H012516/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Nonlinear Equalizer Using a Mixture of Gaussian-Based Online Density Estimator","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2313458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132237S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6777538","onlineDate":"24 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6777542,"authors":[{"name":"Anzhong Hu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6895322/6777542/6777542-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anzhong Hu received the B.Eng. degree from Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China, in 2009.

The traditional ESPRIT-based methods are valid only for one-dimensional (1-D) localization of the ID sources. By contrast, in the proposed approach the signal subspace is constructed for estimating the nominal azimuth and elevation direction-of-arrivals and the angular spreads. The proposed estimator enjoys closed-form expressions and hence it bypasses the searching over the entire feasible field. Therefore, it imposes significantly lower computational complexity than the conventional 2-D estimation approaches. Our analysis shows that the estimation performance of the proposed approach improves when the large-scale/massive MIMO systems are employed. The approximate Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound of the proposed estimator for the 2-D localization is also derived. Numerical results demonstrate that albeit the proposed estimation method is comparable with the traditional 2-D estimators in terms of performance, it benefits from a remarkably lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2313409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2313409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6895322/06777542.pdf","startPage":"996","endPage":"1011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ESPRIT-Based Approach for 2-D Localization of Incoherently Distributed Sources in Massive MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"An ESPRIT-Based Approach for 2-D Localization of Incoherently Distributed Sources in Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"8","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777542/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581800","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777542/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271188"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ESPRIT-Based Approach for 2-D Localization of Incoherently Distributed Sources in Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"jstsp-lv-2313409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.205675S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6895322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"6895322","articleId":"6777542","onlineDate":"24 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6777551,"authors":[{"name":"Xue-Xin Liu","affiliation":["Synopysis Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7046457/6777551/liu-2309606-small.gif","p":["Xue-Xin Liu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Riverside, CA, USA, in 2005, 2008, and 2013, respectively.","He is currently with Synopsys, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA, as a Senior Research and Development Engineer.

In this paper, we study coordinated beamforming optimization for multicell multiple-input-single-output (MISO) downlink systems using energy efficiency as a criterion, which is still an open problem to the best of our knowledge. The optimization problem of interest is nonconvex and in a fractional form. To solve it, we first reveal that finding the solution of the problem is equivalent to searching for a particular point on the Pareto boundary of the newly defined energy-efficiency rate tuples. Then, we propose to use a set of interference temperature (IT)-constrained beamforming optimization problems to characterize the energy-efficiency rate Pareto boundary. Based on that, two efficient iterative algorithms are developed to reach the Pareto optimality and thus to solve the primary problem. We show that the proposed algorithms can be carried out in a decentralized manner and are guaranteed to converge. Then, these algorithms are extended to consider imperfect channel state information (CSI) using the worst-case design. Numerical results are finally provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and they exhibit the great potential of the coordinated beamforming optimization in improving the energy efficiency of the cellular network. In particular, the results also illustrate that our proposed algorithms achieve most of the achievable performance gain with a small number of iterations and thereby with limited backhaul overhead in a time-division duplexing (TDD) system.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2313460","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06777555.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2313460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"4302","endPage":"4314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Energy-Efficient Coordinated Beamforming for Multicell Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Energy-Efficient Coordinated Beamforming for Multicell Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777555/","volume":"63","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6777555/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14735192","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2013ZX03003006-002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271018, 61372101 and 61222102"},{"fundingName":"Research Project of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20130019, BK2011597, BK2012021 and BE2012167"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0088"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Energy-Efficient Coordinated Beamforming for Multicell Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-huang-2313460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098183S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6777555","onlineDate":"24 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6777556,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Ling Ban","affiliation":["Institute of Electromagnetics and School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, P.

Moreover, a three-element bandstop matching circuit is designed to generate an additional resonance for bandwidth enhancement of the lower band. Ultimately, up to five resonances are achieved to cover the desired 704-960- and 1710-2690-MHz bands.

GPUs have tremendous computing potential for data-parallel applications, and the emergence of GPUs has led to proliferation of GPU-accelerated applications. This proliferation has also led to systems in which many applications are competing for access to GPU resources, and efficient utilization of the GPU resources is critical to system performance. Prior techniques of temporal multitasking can be employed with GPU resources as well, but not all GPU kernels make full use of the GPU resources. There is, therefore, an unmet need for spatial multitasking in GPUs. Resources used inefficiently by one kernel can be instead assigned to another kernel that can more effectively use the resources. In this paper we propose a software-hardware solution for efficient spatial-temporal multitasking and a software based emulation framework for our system. We pair an efficient heuristic in software with hardware leaky-bucket based thread-block interleaving to implement spatial-temporal multitasking. We demonstrate our techniques on various GPU architecture using nine representative benchmarks from CUDA SDK. Our experiments on Fermi GTX480 demonstrate performance improvement by up to 46% (average 26%) over sequential GPU task execution and 37% (average 18%) over default concurrent multitasking. Compared with the state-of-the-art Kepler K20 using Hyper-Q technology, our technique achieves up to 40% (average 17%) performance improvement over default concurrent multitasking.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7036147/06777559.pdf","startPage":"748","endPage":"760","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2313342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2313342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7036147","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient GPU Spatial-Temporal Multitasking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Graphics processing units","Multitasking","Resource management","Schedules","Bandwidth","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems","multiprogramming","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU spatial-temporal multitasking","software based emulation framework","hardware leaky-bucket","GPU architecture","CUDA SDK","Fermi GTX480","sequential GPU task execution","default concurrent multitasking","Kepler K20","Hyper-Q technology","thread-block interleaving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","spatial","temporal","multitasking","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Efficient GPU Spatial-Temporal Multitasking","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6777559/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14915377","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient GPU Spatial-Temporal Multitasking","sourcePdf":"tpds-liang-2313342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075639S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7036147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7036147","articleId":"6777559","onlineDate":"24 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6777560,"authors":[{"name":"Nour-Eddine Lasmar","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Group, IMS Laboratory, Institut Polytechnique de Bordeaux, Pessac, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6779706/6777560/lasma-2313232-small.gif","p":["Nour-Eddine Lasmar (S'09\u2013M'14) received the M.Sc. degree (with first class Honors.) degree in computer sciences and telecommunications from the University of Sciences, Rabat, Morocco, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in signal and image processing from the University of Bordeaux I, France, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently a Research Engineer with ENSTA Bretagne, Brest, France.

The strength of the proposed topology lies in a novel, extended unbalance three-level vector modulation technique that can generate the correct ac voltage under unbalanced dc voltage conditions. This paper presents the design philosophy of the proposed configuration and the theoretical framework of the proposed modulation technique. A new control algorithm for the proposed system is also presented in order to control the power delivery between the solar PV, battery, and grid, which simultaneously provides maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operation for the solar PV. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is investigated by the simulation of several scenarios, including battery charging and discharging with different levels of solar irradiation. The proposed methodology and topology is further validated using an experimental setup in the laboratory.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6815993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2014.2309698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/6815993/06777562.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"365","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2014.2309698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solar PV and Battery Storage Integration using a New Configuration of a Three-Level NPC Inverter With Advanced Control Strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Solar PV and Battery Storage Integration using a New Configuration of a Three-Level NPC Inverter With Advanced Control Strategy","volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6777562/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14302028","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solar PV and Battery Storage Integration using a New Configuration of a Three-Level NPC Inverter With Advanced Control Strategy","sourcePdf":"tec-sutanto-2309698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074163S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6815993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6815993","articleId":"6777562","onlineDate":"24 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":6777564,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Savazzi","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Institute of the Italian National Research Council (CNR), Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Savazzi","id":"37295196900"},{"name":"Vittorio Rampa","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Institute of the Italian National Research Council (CNR), Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Rampa","id":"37296060200"},{"name":"Umberto Spagnolini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Umberto","lastName":"Spagnolini","id":"37269649600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-4662"},{"format":"CD","value":"2372-2541"}],"articleNumber":"6777564","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2534},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777564","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Solid modeling","Cloud computing","Large-scale systems","Smart design","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","cloud computing","graph theory","IEC standards","industrial plants","Internet of Things","production engineering computing","radio access networks","solid modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Factory of Things","connectivity modeling","cloud-based wireless network technologies","industrial plants","connectivity prediction","deployment validation","layout design procedures","network information flow","harsh propagation environments","heterogeneous radio access technologies","Internet of Things paradigm","IoT paradigm","comprehensive industry-standard methods","wireless coverage prediction","virtual network deployment","post-layout verification","post-layout validation","radio signal coverage","industrial environments","building blockage","wireless infrastructure","interference-limited radio access scenarios","machine-type communication quality","network layout","oil refinery site","three-dimensional CAD","3D CAD","industry-standard ISA IEC 62734 devices","graph-theoretic approach","node deployment","connectivity properties","industry-standard CAD-based planning systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Factory-of-Things (FoT)","Internet-of-Things (IoT)","industrial wireless communication","machine-type connectivity","network deployment optimization","smart-factory","wireless channel modeling"]}],"abstract":"Large-scale adoption of dense cloud-based wireless network technologies in industrial plants is mandatorily paired with the development of methods and tools for connectivity prediction and deployment validation. Layout design procedures must be able to certify the quality (or reliability) of network information flow in industrial scenarios characterized by harsh propagation environments. In addition, these procedures must account for possibly coexisting heterogeneous radio access technologies as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, easily allow post-layout validation steps, and be integrated by industry-standard CAD-based planning systems. The goal of the paper is to set the fundamentals for comprehensive industry-standard methods and procedures supporting plant designer during wireless coverage prediction, virtual network deployment, and post-layout verification. The proposed methods carry out the prediction of radio signal coverage considering typical industrial environments characterized by highly dense building blockage. They also provide a design framework to properly deploy the wireless infrastructure in interference-limited radio access scenarios. In addition, the model can be effectively used to certify the quality of machine-type communication by considering also imperfect descriptions of the network layout. The design procedures are corroborated by experimental measurements in an oil refinery site [modeled by three-dimensional (3-D) CAD] using industry-standard ISA IEC 62734 devices operating at 2.4 GHz.

As the performance increases, the energy consumption in these systems also increases significantly. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is considered an efficient scheme to achieve the goal of saving energy, because it allows processors to dynamically adjust their supply voltages and/or execution frequencies to work on different power/energy levels. In this paper, we consider scheduling non-preemptive frame-based tasks on DVFS-enabled heterogeneous multiprocessor platforms with the goal of achieving minimal overall energy consumption. We consider three types of heterogeneous platforms, namely, dependent platforms without runtime adjusting, dependent platforms with runtime adjusting, and independent platforms. For these three platforms, we first formulate the problems as binary integer programming problems, and then, relax them as convex optimization problems, which can be solved by the well-known interior point method. We propose a Relaxation-based Iterative Rounding Algorithm (RIRA), which tries to achieve the task set partition, that is closest to the optimal solution of the relaxed problems, in every step of a task-to-processor assignment. Experiments and comparisons show that our RIRA produces a better performance than existing methods and a simple but naive method, and achieves near-optimal scheduling under most cases. We also provide comprehensive complexity, accuracy and scalability analysis for the RIRA approach by investigating the interior-point method and by running specially designed experiments. Experimental results also show that the proposed RIRA approach is an efficient and practically applicable scheme with reasonable complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2313338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7036147/06777565.pdf","startPage":"810","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2313338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7036147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing Energy Consumption for Frame-Based Tasks on Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777565/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing Energy Consumption for Frame-Based Tasks on Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Platforms","volume":"26","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14915378","htmlLink":"/document/6777565/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing Energy Consumption for Frame-Based Tasks on Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Platforms","sourcePdf":"tpds-li-2313338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084876S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7036147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7036147","articleId":"6777565","onlineDate":"24 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6777576,"authors":[{"name":"Ali H.

We study the implications of clock drift and communication latency on the accuracy of clock synchronization when scaling the network diameter. Starting with a theoretical analysis of synchronization protocols, we prove tight bounds on the synchronization error in a model that assumes independently and randomly distributed communication delays and slowly changing drifts. While this model is more optimistic than traditional worst-case analysis, it much better captures the nature of real-world systems such as wireless networks. The bound on the synchronization accuracy, which is roughly the square root of the network diameter, is achieved by the novel PulseSync protocol. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PulseSync is able to meet the predictions from theory and tightly synchronizes large networks. This contrasts against an exponential growth of the skew incurred by the state-of-the-art protocol for wireless sensor networks. Moreover, PulseSync adapts much faster to network dynamics and changing clock drifts than this protocol.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2014.2309805","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7122959/06777583.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2014.2309805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7122959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PulseSync: An Efficient and Scalable Clock Synchronization Protocol","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777583","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777583/","displayDocTitle":"PulseSync: An Efficient and Scalable Clock Synchronization Protocol","volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15201228","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777583/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PulseSync: An Efficient and Scalable Clock Synchronization Protocol","sourcePdf":"tnet-lenzen-2309805-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08757S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7122959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7122959","articleId":"6777583","onlineDate":"24 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6777585,"authors":[{"name":"Le Zheng","affiliation":["Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6805240/6777585/6777585-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Le Zheng (S'05) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from University of California in Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, and the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, China, in 2009 and 2007, respectively.

Considering the similarity of the cases that the system is unobservable and that the system becomes unobservable if a critical measurement or a critical pair is removed from the measurement set, a unified algorithm of PMU placement for state estimation combining observability analysis and bad data detection into a single iterative procedure is presented. In each iteration of the algorithm, PMU placement is performed to make the system observable, or make critical measurements become non-critical, or make critical pairs become non-critical pairs, respectively. Based on Theorem 3.1 in \u201cA direct numerical method for observability analysis\u201d (Gou and Abur, IEEE Trans. Power Syst., vol. 15, no. 2, pp. 625-630, May 2000), this paper presents an improved optimal PMU placement algorithm wherein each iteration is performed by a significantly smaller integer linear programming (ILP) model whose size is governed by the rank deficiency of the Jacobian matrix resulting from the configuration of conventional measurements. The proposed formulation thus leads to a far more smaller and simpler ILP problem compared to existing methods. Additional results are also presented to identify critical measurement pairs. The proposed approach is illustrated on the IEEE 14- and 118-bus systems.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2307577","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6926883/06777591.pdf","startPage":"2573","endPage":"2580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2307577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926883","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified PMU Placement for Observability and Bad Data Detection in State Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unified PMU Placement for Observability and Bad Data Detection in State Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777591/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14682678","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified PMU Placement for Observability and Bad Data Detection in State Estimation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-gou-2307577-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050774S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6926883","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6926883","articleId":"6777591","onlineDate":"24 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6777704,"authors":[{"name":"Debasis Dawn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"firstName":"Debasis","lastName":"Dawn","id":"37311683200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2501-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2377-9144"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-9152"}],"articleNumber":"6777704","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":915},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","Switching circuits","Power generation","Power measurement","Switches","Millimeter wave transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","low-power electronics","millimetre wave power amplifiers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter wave power amplifier","CMOS switching power amplifier","V-band power amplifier","W-band power amplifier","low power transmitter applications","SOI CMOS process","class-AB amplifier","class-E switching mode topology","size 45 nm","frequency 52 GHz","voltage 1.0 V","gain 7 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimeter wave","CMOS","switching","power amplifier","transmitter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777704","abstract":"Millimeter-wave switching power amplifiers are developed both in V-band and in W-band targeting successful line-up implementations in low-power transmitter applications using 45nm SOI CMOS process.

While the behavioral models known in the literature mainly focus on the precise description of the PA nonlinearity in terms of amplitude-modulation-to-amplitude-modulation (AM-AM) and amplitude-modulation-to-phase-modulation (AM-PM) distortions, the model introduced here, also predicts the DC current flowing from the power supply to the PA. This allows to optimize the battery current while keeping the out-of-channel interference within specification limits. In a case study, the DC current and the amplitude distortions of a PA, designed for IEEE 802.11b/g/n applications are predicted with a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of -39.92 dB and -47.07 dB, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6777718/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14197255","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel power amplifier behavioral model for improving the linearity-efficiency tradeoff","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel power amplifier behavioral model for improving the linearity-efficiency tradeoff","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"181NGVHK0NaXqWp2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049742S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6767435","isNumber":"6777691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767435","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6777691","articleId":"6777718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6777743,"authors":[{"name":"S.

One of these radars operates over the frequency range of 2-8 GHz and is referred to as the \u201csnow radar\u201d. The other operates over the frequency range of 12-18 GHz and is called the \u201cKu-band radar\u201d or \u201cKu-band altimeter\u201d. Both radars use a Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FM-CW) transmit signal with about 150 mW of power. The radars have been operated on NASA long-range P-3 and DC-8 aircraft to collect data over snow-covered sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic, as well as over the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The results from recent data show that we can determine the thickness of snow from about 20 cm to 200 cm over sea ice and can map near surface internal layers to a depth of about 50 m in the dry snow zone with the snow radar. We are currently developing a radar that operates over the frequency range of 2-18 GHz and an antenna array to perform multi-polarized measurements. In this paper we will provide a brief overview of the current radars and present results from data collected with these radars over sea ice and the ice sheets. We will also discuss the design of the radar being developed and our plans to collect data over the ice sheets and over snow on ice and land.","doi":"10.1109/IMaRC.2013.6777743","publicationTitle":"IEEE MTT-S International Microwave and RF Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE MTT-S International Microwave and RF Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767435/6777691/06777743.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMaRC.2013.6777743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-wideband radars for remote sensing of snow and ice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-wideband radars for remote sensing of snow and ice","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777743/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14197254","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-wideband radars for remote sensing of snow and ice","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"248NH1T7bXuLzXr2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048916S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6767435","isNumber":"6777691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767435","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6777691","articleId":"6777743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6777754,"authors":[{"name":"Akhilesh Jain","affiliation":["RF Systems Division, Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore, India"],"firstName":"Akhilesh","lastName":"Jain","id":"37310196700"},{"name":"D.

The traditional technologies used in the backhaul, copper, radio links and optical fibers, either cannot offer high data-rate, or are expensive. In this paper, we propose mixed integer programming models to facilitate upgrading the cellular backhaul using the free space optical (FSO) technology, a cost-effective and high-bandwidth solution. Since the optical signal is transmitted along line-of-sight and FSO links are sensitive to weather conditions, we incorporate mirrors in the models to provide alternative paths for pairs of FSO nodes without line-of-sight, and increase the path diversity to enhance the resilience. Optical fibers existing in the backhaul are considered in the models and reused to decrease the upgrading cost and improve reliability. The presented models can deliver topologies for various requirements on cost and resilience. They can also be used to develop topology planning and optimization tools.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766882/6777759/06777766.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","doi":"10.1109/IWOW.2013.6777766","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWOW.2013.6777766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777759","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of cellular backhaul topology using the FSO technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mirrors","Optical fiber communication","Optical sensors","Topology","Reliability","Network topology","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","integer programming","optical fibre communication","optical links","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization tools","topology planning","FSO links","line-of-sight links","optical signal","free space optical technology","mixed integer programming models","optical fibers","cellular backhaul networks","high-speed services","mobile devices","FSO technology","cellular backhaul topology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Design of cellular backhaul topology using the FSO technology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777766/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14209205","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of cellular backhaul topology using the FSO technology","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"07p6li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080335S","chronDate":"21-21 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766882","isNumber":"6777759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766882","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6777759","articleId":"6777766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6777774,"authors":[{"name":"Imran Shafique Ansari","affiliation":["Computer Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Makkah Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Imran Shafique","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37679657400"},{"name":"Ferkan Yilmaz","affiliation":["ITU ARI-3 Teknokent, Vodafone Technology in Turkey, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ferkan","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"37408923000"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Computer Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Makkah Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1188-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6777774","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Barium","Conferences","Wireless communication","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterodyne detection","intensity modulation","optical links","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF/FSO dual-hop transmission systems","dual-branch transmission system","direct radiofrequency link","dual-hop relay","free-space optical links","intensity modulation/direct detection","heterodyne detection","selection combining diversity scheme","Rayleigh fading distribution","gamma-gamma fading distribution","closed-form expressions","cumulative distribution function","probability density function","moment generating function","end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio","Meijer's G function","outage probability","M-ary modulation schemes","ergodic capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetric dual-hop relay system","optical wireless communications","free-space optical (FSO) communications"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we present the performance analysis of a dual-branch transmission system composed of a direct radio frequency (RF) link and a dual-hop relay composed of asymmetric RF and free-space optical (FSO) links.

However, FSO links are quite sensitive to atmospheric conditions. Fog droplets, but also raindrops and snowflakes, may introduce severe path attenuation which drastically reduces the channel availability. A parametric model to simulate droplets scattering effects on FSO links (from visible to near infrared wavelengths) is proposed in terms of scattering coefficients, albedo factor and asymmetry coefficient as function of the particle water content. Both single and multiple scattering effects are shown and discussed. A prototype of a stochastic time series generator of FSO rain attenuation is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/IWOW.2013.6777777","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766882/6777759/06777777.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWOW.2013.6777777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hydrometeor scattering and stochastic modeling for free-space optical channel characterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777777/","displayDocTitle":"Hydrometeor scattering and stochastic modeling for free-space optical channel characterization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14197237","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777777/","conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hydrometeor scattering and stochastic modeling for free-space optical channel characterization","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"18p58mori.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074914S","chronDate":"21-21 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766882","isNumber":"6777759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766882","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6777759","articleId":"6777777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6777778,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Brazda","affiliation":["Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Prague 4, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Brazda","id":"37945157000"},{"name":"Ondrej Fiser","affiliation":["Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Prague 4, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ondrej","lastName":"Fiser","id":"37284198400"},{"name":"Carlo Capsoni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Capsoni","id":"37264927300"},{"name":"Roberto Nebuloni","affiliation":["CNR-IEIIT, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Nebuloni","id":"37318454400"},{"name":"Petr Pesice","affiliation":["Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Prague 4, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Pesice","id":"37945158900"},{"name":"Zuzana Chladova","affiliation":["Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Prague 4, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zuzana","lastName":"Chladova","id":"37945158800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1188-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6777778","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Clouds","Atmospheric measurements","Optical fiber communication","Optical attenuators","Conferences","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clouds","optical dispersion","optical links","optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free space optical link attenuation","drop size distribution","Khrgian-Mazin model","particle surface area","liquid water content","Czech Republic","Milesovka hill","cloud microphysics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["free space optics","attenuation","visibility","liquid water content","particle surface area","drop size distribution"]}],"abstract":"Our experimental site is located on the top of the Milesovka hill in the Czech Republic.

We discuss this unbalanced SOA operation and analytically derive the first order statistics of the optical signal at the SOA output, giving emphasis on the scintillation index and the fade probability.

The SM technique represents a low complexity, alternative method of increasing the number of bits transmitted per symbol. The technique depends on the natural disparity in the channel parameters of optical sources that occupy different positions in space. As a result, the error performance of an SM technique is heavily influenced by the receiver location with respect to the optical sources as well as how similar or dissimilar the channel gain values are. Simulation results for three transmitting LED sources in a room show that for a mobile receiver to ensure wireless communication at a symbol error rate of 10-6, up to 109 dB of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is required. This high SNR requirement will undoubtedly impose limitations on the system particularly when the receiver is mobile and the available optical power is limited.","doi":"10.1109/IWOW.2013.6777797","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (IWOW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766882/6777759/06777797.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWOW.2013.6777797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777759","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Merits and limitations of spatial modulation for optical wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Merits and limitations of spatial modulation for optical wireless communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777797/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14197244","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6777797/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Merits and limitations of spatial modulation for optical wireless communications","confLoc":"Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK","sourcePdf":"38p152popoola.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067203S","chronDate":"21-21 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766882","isNumber":"6777759","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766882","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6777759","articleId":"6777797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6777814,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

This paper focuses on the design and implementation of a fast FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Array) based architecture using reversible contrast mapping (RCM) based image watermarking algorithm. The specialty of this architecture attracts to the fact of clock-less encoder design and implementation which makes the design faster. The encoder module response time is independent of clock frequency, so the embedding of the watermark is possible as soon as the input is fetched. The schematic based design and implementation of the VLSI architecture have been done with Xilinx 14.1 on Spartan 3E FPGA family. The encoder requires 528 4-input LUTs and 303 slices. On the contrary, the decoder requires 613 LUTs and 347 slices. The maximum clock frequency of the decoder is 45 MHz. The results show the viability of low cost, high speed realtime use of the proposed VLSI architecture.","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766336/6777807/06777819.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EICT.2014.6777819","doi":"10.1109/EICT.2014.6777819","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of fast FPGA based architecture for reversible watermarking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of fast FPGA based architecture for reversible watermarking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777819/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6777819/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197067","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of fast FPGA based architecture for reversible watermarking","confLoc":"Khulna, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"1084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137951S","chronDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766336","isNumber":"6777807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766336","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6777807","articleId":"6777819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6777821,"authors":[{"name":"Anindya Bijoy Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Anindya Bijoy","lastName":"Das","id":"37085348541"},{"name":"Mohammed Imamul Hassan Bhuiyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mohammed Imamul Hassan","lastName":"Bhuiyan","id":"37295966400"},{"name":"S.

Sensing the licensed spectrum to seek for spatiotemporal information of any possible spectrum hole is the first step needed to be performed by the CR devices. In this paper we propose an adaptive threshold technique to extract spectrum hole information from Multi-taper Spectrum Estimator (MSE) estimated spectrum. It has been found that when threshold is adapted depending on the change in noise level and presence of primary or secondary signals in a TV band, the detection performance improves compared to fixed threshold. A 400 kHz band was split into 20kHz sub bands to verify the possibility of splitting the TV bands into 200kHz bands from CR usage perspective. From analytical calculations and MATLAB simulations it has been shown that if TV band is viewed as 200 kHz sub-band channels from CR perspective; blocking probability for CR operation can be reduced. In addition it has also been shown that sensing multiple TV bands simultaneously can help CRs to find more opportunities with minor impact on system complexity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EICT.2014.6777828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777807","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766336/6777807/06777828.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum hole identification in multiple TV bands by adaptive threshold multi-taper spectrum estimator for cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6777828/","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum hole identification in multiple TV bands by adaptive threshold multi-taper spectrum estimator for cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197042","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum hole identification in multiple TV bands by adaptive threshold multi-taper spectrum estimator for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Khulna, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"1116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077744S","chronDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766336","isNumber":"6777807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766336","xplore-issue":"6777807","articleId":"6777828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6777829,"authors":[{"name":"Shumit Saha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Khulna, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Shumit","lastName":"Saha","id":"38488976300"},{"name":"Md.

In a spectrum sharing network, where secondary user can communicate simultaneously along with the primary user in the same frequency band, one of the challenges is to obtain balance between two conflicting goals that are to minimize the interference to the primary users and to improve the performance of the secondary user. In our paper we have considered a primary link and a secondary link (cognitive link) in a fading channel. To improve the performance of the secondary user by maintaining the Quality of Service (Qos) to the primary user, we considered varying the transmit power of the cognitive user. For this we proposed ANFIS based opportunistic power control strategy with primary user's SNR and primary user's interference channel gain as inputs. By using fuzzy inference system, Qos of primary user is adhered and there is no need of complex feedback channel from primary receiver. The simulation results of the proposed strategy shows better performance than the one without power control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777837/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14197059","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777837/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ANFIS based opportunistic power control for cognitive radio in spectrum sharing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANFIS based opportunistic power control for cognitive radio in spectrum sharing","confLoc":"Khulna, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"1163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044181S","chronDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766336","isNumber":"6777807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766336","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6777807","articleId":"6777837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6777841,"authors":[{"name":"Elham Hosseini","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Iran"],"firstName":"Elham","lastName":"Hosseini","id":"37085427626"},{"name":"Abolfazl Falahati","affiliation":["Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), Iran"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Falahati","id":"37300886700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2299-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2297-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6777841","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Interference channels","Cognitive radio","Algorithm design and analysis","Interference constraints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation grouping scheme","OFDM-based cognitive radio system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","primary user receivers","primary user frequency band","interference power level","subcarriers","interference constraint","water filling algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Power Allocation Algorithm","OFDM","Water Filling Algorithm"]}],"abstract":"A power allocation grouping scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based Cognitive Radio systems is proposed that can improve capacity while the interference power for primary user receivers stays at constant level. In this scheme, all idle subcarriers are divided into four groups based on the inserted interference power level into the primary user frequency band. Then, the power is allocated to subcarriers in two stages. At the first stage, considering interference constraint, the power is assigned to subcarriers into groups 1, 2 and 3. At the second stage, the remaining power is allocated to other idle subcarriers with water filling algorithm.

The design of a mobile satellite communication antenna named as Parabolic Helix and link budget optimization of the proposed antenna system are illustrated in this paper. The proposed antenna has a gain of 15.95dB, directivity of 19.36dBi; return loss value of -28.0573dB, Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) of 1.08, bandwidth of 68.3MHz, antenna efficiency of 45.6% and 3dB angular beamwidth i.e., the Half Power Beamwidth (HPBW) of 29.5deg. The resonant frequency of the antenna array is 5.982 GHz. The proposed antenna system can be used for C-band applications like satellite communications transmissions, Wi-Fi, cordless telephones, weather radar systems and other wireless systems. The antenna system is designed and simulated in the CST Microwave Studio. Link budgets are performed in order to analyze the critical factors in the transmission chain and to optimize the performance characteristics, such as transmission power, system noise temperature, figure of merit and so on. The link budget determines what size antenna i s to use, power requirements and in general, the overall customer satisfaction.

Adaptive Channel Estimation (ACE) is a widely used estimation technique for MIMO-OFDM systems. Different types of channel estimator like least mean square (LMS), normalized least square (NLMS) are applied to ACE. LMS algorithm has low complexity but it suffers from high minimum mean square error (MMSE) performance. Normalized least mean square algorithm (NLMS) provides low MMSE performance with poor convergence rate. In this paper, an improved sign data normalized least mean square (SDNLMS) channel estimation technique is proposed which improves the convergence rate and computational complexity of NLMS algorithm, while maintaining low MMSE performance for channel estimation (CE). Simulation results show that SDNLMS CE method provides faster convergence rate with low MMSE and computational complexity, which is clearly better than NLMS and LMS method in a MIMO-OFDM system. Therefore SDNLMS CE method can be highly compatible for ACE process.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766336/6777807/06777867.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","doi":"10.1109/EICT.2014.6777867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EICT.2014.6777867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity SDNLMS Adaptive Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Least squares approximations","Convergence","OFDM","Computational complexity","Adaptive systems","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","convergence","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity SDNLMS adaptive channel estimation","MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency domain multiplexing","wireless communication systems","least mean square algorithm","normalized least square LMS algorithm","minimum mean square error performance","MMSE performance","sign data normalized least mean square","NLMS algorithm","CE method","ACE process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","LMS","NLMS","SDNLMS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity SDNLMS Adaptive Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777867/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197009","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity SDNLMS Adaptive Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Khulna, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"1282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05116S","chronDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766336","isNumber":"6777807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766336","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6777807","articleId":"6777867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6777868,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A number of PSO based methods have been investigated for solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the popular combinatorial problem. The velocity for solving TSP is the Swap Sequence (SS) with several Swap Operators (SOs) and all SOs of a SS are applied maintaining order on a particle and gives a new tour i.e., a particle having new solution in the PSO. This study investigates a new PSO based method, called Velocity Tentative PSO (VTPSO), for solving TSP where calculated velocity SS is considered as tentative velocity. VTPSO evaluates a number of tentative tours applying SOs one after another sequentially and the final tour is considered as the best tentative tour. VTPSO is shown to produce optimal solution within a minimal time when compared with traditional PSO based methods in solving benchmark TSPs. The reason behind the less time requirement is revealed from the experimental analysis is that VTPSO converge faster due to intermediate tour evaluation.","doi":"10.1109/EICT.2014.6777868","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766336/6777807/06777868.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EICT.2014.6777868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Velocity Tentative Particle Swarm Optimization to solve TSP","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["velocity tentative particle swarm optimization","TSP","traveling salesman problem","population based optimization technique","swap sequence","SS","swap operators","SO","VTPSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Traveling Salesman Problem and Swap Sequence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Velocity Tentative Particle Swarm Optimization to solve TSP","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6777868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197061","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Velocity Tentative Particle Swarm Optimization to solve TSP","confLoc":"Khulna, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"1284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053716S","chronDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766336","isNumber":"6777807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766336","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6777807","articleId":"6777868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6777877,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Hamja","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Mymensingh Engineering College, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Hamja","id":"37086650852"},{"name":"Md.

Coherent detection permits the optical field parameters (amplitude, phase and polarization) to be available in the electrical domain enabling new opportunity for multi-level signaling (M-ary PSK and M-ary QAM modulation), as well as the possibility of exploring polarization multiplexing. Again, it enables quasi-exact compensation of linear transmission impairments by a linear filter (equalizer), which can operate adaptively to overcome time-varying impairments. That is why Coherent detection employing QAM modulation formats has become one of the most promising technologies for next generation high speed transmission systems due to the high power and spectral efficiencies. With the development of DSP, coherent optical receivers allow the significant estimation of CD. In recent days, the realizations of these DSP algorithms for mitigating the chromatic dispersion in the coherent transmission systems are the most attractive investigations. In this paper, CD estimation technique has been improved using DSP algorithm and optimal OSNR, BER have been achieved.","doi":"10.1109/EICT.2014.6777877","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766336/6777807/06777877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EICT.2014.6777877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777807","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP aided chromatic dispersion reckoning in single carrier high speed coherent optical communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DSP aided chromatic dispersion reckoning in single carrier high speed coherent optical communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777877/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14196995","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6777877/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP aided chromatic dispersion reckoning in single carrier high speed coherent optical communications","confLoc":"Khulna, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"1324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048058S","chronDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766336","isNumber":"6777807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766336","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6777807","articleId":"6777877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6777886,"authors":[{"name":"Nilanjon Chakraborty","affiliation":["Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Nilanjon","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37086719427"},{"name":"Md.

Among several Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based methods, Hybrid PSO (HPSO) is the most recent one and is shown to achieve optimal solution. In those exiting algorithms including HPSO, some important features regarding co-class concept, format of classes, lab scheduling, etc. are either ignored or adopted partially.

In this model the input magnitude ranges from the lowest and highest value of the given input. The converted value is then multiplied by complex weight and then they sums up to feed into an activation function. The activation function converts the complex value into real value within a certain range. We used this encoding system in solving different Boolean problems. Some real world benchmark problems are also tested by this process. Different time series analysis is performed to test the prediction ability of this encoding system. The result shows that this magnitude encoding provides better accuracy in different benchmark problems.

radio network, which deals with dynamic frequency assignment, is one of the most popular research topic nowadays in the context of cellular networks, WLANs and mesh networks as well. The growing interest in the cognitive radio technology and its capability to offer more efficient spectrum usage attracts researchers to find efficient algorithms to accommodate more users and to provide better service in wireless communication. In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for selecting channels, in cognitive radio environment, so that the load is distributed over them for more efficient service. Simulations and experimental results show the efficacy of proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14196990","htmlLink":"/document/6777900/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A distributed load balancing algorithm for adaptive cognitive radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed load balancing algorithm for adaptive cognitive radio network","confLoc":"Khulna, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"1406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078527S","chronDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766336","isNumber":"6777807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766336","xplore-issue":"6777807","articleId":"6777900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6777901,"authors":[{"name":"Ratan Kumar Mondal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Ratan Kumar","lastName":"Mondal","id":"38542361100"},{"name":"Nirzhar Saha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Nirzhar","lastName":"Saha","id":"38542560200"},{"name":"Yeong Min Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yeong Min","lastName":"Jang","id":"37536259400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2299-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2297-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6777901","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1005},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receivers","Optical transmitters","Multiplexing","Cameras","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","light emitting diodes","MIMO communication","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance enhancement","MIMO based visible light communication","VLC","camera based visible light communication","vision technology","hand held devices","Smartphone","light emitting diode","LED transmitter","robust signal reception","spatial multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visible light communication","image sensor","LED","MIMO","Spatial Multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"The camera based visible light communication (VLC) is the merger of VLC with vision technology in order to deploy VLC features in hand-held devices e.g., in Smartphone, employing light emitting diode (LED) transmitter to camera communication. However, the most advantageous features of VLC technology have not been achieved due to the low frame handling rate in camera module. In contrast, the spatially light source separation characteristic in camera module explores the scope to deploy multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) concept for enhancing the overall system capacity and robust signal reception in camera based VLC system. In this paper, the performance of spatial multiplexing in MIMO based VLC system is evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/EICT.2014.6777901","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766336/6777807/06777901.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EICT.2014.6777901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777807","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance enhancement of MIMO based visible light communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6777901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance enhancement of MIMO based visible light communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6777901/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197005","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6777901/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance enhancement of MIMO based visible light communication","confLoc":"Khulna, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"1407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050662S","chronDate":"13-15 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766336","isNumber":"6777807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766336","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6777807","articleId":"6777901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6777902,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In particular, we consider a spectrum sharing system where a set of potential relays are employed to help a pair of secondary users in the presence of a licensed (primary) user. Among the available relays, only the reliable ones participate in the beamforming process, where the beamformer weights are obtained based on a linear optimization method. We investigate two well-known strategies, namely, selection decode-and-forward (SDF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying in conjunction with distributed optimal beamforming. However, given the complexity of the performance analysis with optimal beamforming, we use zero forcing beamforming (ZFB), and compare both approaches through simulations. In this context, for SDF, we derive expressions for the probability density function (PDF) of the received signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) at the relays as well as at the secondary destination. As for the AF scheme, we obtain the exact expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the moment generating function (MGF) of the equivalent end-to-end SNR at the secondary destination. For both schemes, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability and bit error rate (BER) over independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels for binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) schemes. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme in improving the outage and BER performance of the secondary system while limiting the interference to the primary system. In addition, the results show the effectiveness of the combination of the cooperative diversity and distributed beamforming in compensating for the loss in the secondary system's performance due to the primary user's co-channel interference (CCI).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14236076","htmlLink":"/document/6778007/","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Cooperative Relaying Spectrum-Sharing Systems with Collaborative Distributed Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Cooperative Relaying Spectrum-Sharing Systems with Collaborative Distributed Beamforming","sourcePdf":"0857-tc1403-afana.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12293S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6777265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6777265","articleId":"6778007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6778012,"authors":[{"name":"Di Che","affiliation":["National ICT Australia\u2013Victoria Research Laboratory, Department of Electric and Electrical Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Che","id":"37061773100"},{"name":"Hamid Khodakarami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Khodakarami","id":"38015269600"},{"name":"An Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Li","id":"37400036000"},{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37856179800"},{"name":"Trevor Anderson","affiliation":["National ICT Australia\u2013Victoria Research Laboratory, Department of Electric and Electrical Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Anderson","id":"37285571700"},{"name":"William Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37299254300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6778012","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier Reliability Aware Soft-Decision LDPC Code in CO-OFDM Systems","abstract":"We propose a subcarrier reliability aware low-density parity-check (SRA-LDPC) soft-decision coding scheme for coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) systems.

The population-based evolutionary multimodal optimization algorithms can be very helpful in such cases. They detect and maintain multiple optimal solutions during the run by incorporating specialized niching operations to aid the parallel localized convergence of population members around different basins of attraction. This paper presents an improved information-sharing mechanism among the individuals of an evolutionary algorithm for inducing efficient niching behavior. The mechanism can be integrated with stochastic real-parameter optimizers relying on differential perturbation of the individuals (candidate solutions) based on the population distribution. Various real-coded genetic algorithms (GAs), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE) fit the example of such algorithms. The main problem arising from differential perturbation is the unequal attraction toward the different basins of attraction that is detrimental to the objective of parallel convergence to multiple basins of attraction. We present our study through DE algorithm owing to its highly random nature of mutation and show how population diversity is preserved by modifying the basic perturbation (mutation) scheme through the use of random individuals selected probabilistically. By integrating the proposed technique with DE framework, we present three improved versions of well-known DE-based niching methods. Through an extensive experimental analysis, a statistically significant improvement in the overall performance has been observed upon integrating of our technique with the DE-based niching methods.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2014.2313659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2014.2313659","startPage":"246","endPage":"263","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/7070844/06778013.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7070844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inducing Niching Behavior in Differential Evolution Through Local Information Sharing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Inducing Niching Behavior in Differential Evolution Through Local Information Sharing","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2015","accessionNumber":"15019520","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6778013/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inducing Niching Behavior in Differential Evolution Through Local Information Sharing","sourcePdf":"tevc-das-2313659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.206944S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"7070844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"7070844","articleId":"6778013","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":6778014,"authors":[{"name":"Yam P.

In this paper, we propose a new framework for probabilistic construction of codes on 2D arrays. Instead of a pure combinatorial erasure model used in traditional array codes, we propose a mixed combinatorial-probabilistic model of limiting the number of column failures, and assuming a binary erasure channel in each failing column. For this model, we give code constructions and detailed analysis that allow sustaining a large number of column failures with graceful degradation in the fraction of erasures correctable in failing columns. Another advantage of the new framework is that it uses low-complexity iterative decoding. The key component in the analysis of the new codes is to analyze the decoding graphs induced by the failed columns, and infer the decoding performance as a function of the code design parameters, as well as the array size and failure parameters. A particularly interesting class of codes, called probabilistically maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes, gives fault-tolerance that is equivalent to traditional MDS array codes. The results also include a proof that the 2D codes outperform standard 1D low-density parity-check codes.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2313720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6816018/06778036.pdf","startPage":"3279","endPage":"3291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2313720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC Codes for 2D Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778036/","displayDocTitle":"LDPC Codes for 2D Arrays","volume":"60","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14301834","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778036/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"School of Computer and Communication Sciences, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"},{"fundingName":"ERC and CIG Grants through the European Union"},{"fundingName":"Israeli Ministry of Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC Codes for 2D Arrays","sourcePdf":"tit-cassuto-2313720-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066071S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6816018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6816018","articleId":"6778036","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6778037,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Hoon Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Hoon","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086627501"},{"name":"Joonghee Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Joonghee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37081731100"},{"name":"Jong-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Gachon University, Seongnam, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37065070400"},{"name":"Yong-Hwa Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Hwa","lastName":"Kim","id":"37311197900"},{"name":"Seong-Cheol Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Cheol","lastName":"Kim","id":"37291921400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"6778037","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":984},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"The user body inevitably located near a portable wireless terminal is known to dominantly affect the wireless link. In this communication, user-shadowing effects are investigated at 2.4 GHz by using a ray-tracing technique comprising the following three steps. First, the shadowing effects depending on the states and relative positions of the user are examined to determine the power loss on a single propagation path based on the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD), which has been verified by measurements in an anechoic chamber. Next, we combine the single path models with the multipath channel profiles obtained from the ray-tracing prediction, which also has been validated by comparison with in-building measurements. Finally, a user-shadowing path loss model is established by a statistical analysis of the ray-tracing simulations taking into consideration the randomness of the user's positions. Nakagami- m distributions well describe the user-shadowing effects over diverse indoor propagation scenarios. We found that the K-factor can be a major indicator of the user-shadowing effects. Consequently, we propose the statistical user-shadowing model in which m exponentially decreases as the K-factor increases whereas \u03a9 is independent of the K-factor.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6823189/06778037.pdf","startPage":"3412","endPage":"3416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2313637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2313637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823189","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray-Tracing-Aided Modeling of User-Shadowing Effects in Indoor Wireless Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shadow mapping","Ray tracing","Receivers","Antenna measurements","Wireless communication","Analytical models","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anechoic chambers (electromagnetic)","indoor radio","Nakagami channels","radio links","ray tracing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-factor","diverse indoor propagation scenarios","Nakagami-m distributions","ray-tracing simulations","statistical analysis","user-shadowing path loss model","ray-tracing prediction","multipath channel profiles","anechoic chamber","uniform theory of diffraction","single propagation path","ray-tracing technique","wireless link","portable wireless terminal","indoor wireless channels","user-shadowing effects","ray-tracing-aided modeling","frequency 24 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor wireless channel","ray-tracing technique","uniform theory of diffraction","user-shadowing effects"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Ray-Tracing-Aided Modeling of User-Shadowing Effects in Indoor Wireless Channels","volume":"62","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6778037/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14362301","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray-Tracing-Aided Modeling of User-Shadowing Effects in Indoor Wireless Channels","sourcePdf":"tap-kim-2313637-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051347S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6823189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6823189","articleId":"6778037","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6778038,"authors":[{"name":"Jiantao Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6802373/6778038/zhou-2310200-small.gif","p":["Jiantao Zhou (S'11) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree."]},"firstName":"Jiantao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085442335"},{"name":"Kuk-Hwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6802373/6778038/kim-2310200-small.gif","p":["Kuk-Hwan Kim received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, the M.S. degree from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 2005, 2007, and 2011, respectively."]},"firstName":"Kuk-Hwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406168000"},{"name":"Wei Lu","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, Grenoble Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6802373/6778038/lu-2310200-small.gif","p":["Wei Lu (M'05) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, in 1996 and 2003, respectively.","He was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, from 2003 to 2005.

The key idea lies in partitioning the users into groups with approximately similar channel covariance eigenvectors and serving these groups by using two-stage downlink precoding scheme obtained as the concatenation of a pre-beamforming matrix, that depends only on the channel second-order statistics, with a multiuser MIMO linear precoding matrix, which is a function of the effective channels including pre-beamforming. The role of pre-beamforming is to reduce the dimensionality of the effective channel by exploiting the near-orthogonality of the eigenspaces of the channel covariances of the different user groups. This paper is an extension of our initial work on JSDM, and addresses some important practical issues. First, we focus on the regime of finite number of antennas and large number of users and show that JSDM with simple opportunistic user selection is able to achieve the same scaling law of the system capacity with full channel state information. Next, we consider the large-system regime (both antennas and users growing large) and propose a simple scheme for user grouping in a realistic setting where users have different angles of arrival and angular spreads. Finally, we propose a low-overhead probabilistic scheduling algorithm that selects the users at random with probabilities derived from large-system random matrix analysis. Since only the pre-selected users are required to feedback their channel state information, the proposed scheme realizes important savings in the CSIT feedback.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2313808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2313808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6895322/06778043.pdf","startPage":"876","endPage":"890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing: Opportunistic Beamforming, User Grouping and Simplified Downlink Scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing: Opportunistic Beamforming, User Grouping and Simplified Downlink Scheduling","volume":"8","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778043/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581795","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778043/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing: Opportunistic Beamforming, User Grouping and Simplified Downlink Scheduling","sourcePdf":"jstsp-caire-2313808-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114963S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6895322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"242","xplore-issue":"6895322","articleId":"6778043","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6778047,"authors":[{"name":"George S.

This is achieved through RF characterization of an MDM RoF link, which is experimentally demonstrated to be capable of supporting at least 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO with 6 GHz channels over long lengths of MMF (2 km compared to ~300 m typically found in MMF-based RoF DASs) and under tight fiber bending conditions (bend radius as low as 7.6 mm), which are commonly encountered in in-building fiber installations. First, experimental RF measurements are performed over a 2 km section of OM2 fiber, mode-multiplexed using a spatial light modulator (SLM) based MUX/DEMUX system, and it is shown to offer an RF condition number of <;14 dB for up to 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO with 6 GHz channels, sufficient to enable good performance for\u22a3 most modern wireless protocols. Next, the effect of fiber curvature on RF performance is experimentally analysed using a 10 m section of OM3 fiber. It is seen that with a bend radius as low as 7.2 mm, a condition number of ~10 dB can be achieved for up to a 6 \u00d7 6 MIMO system with 6 GHz channels. Although an SLM-based MUX/DEMUX is used here, condition number is not dependent on the exact mode-launching system used provided that orthogonal combinations of modes are excited, which is true of most MDM systems. It is therefore concluded that the RF characterization presented here demonstrates by proof-of-principle the feasibility of graded-index) MMF to support at least 4 \u00d7 4 MIMO with broadband channels via MDM over lengths up to 2 km and with fiber bend radii as low as 7.2 mm.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave

Many features (such as histogram of oriented gradient, local binary pattern, scale-invariant feature transform, etc.) have been used to improve the performance of object detection, but mostly in simple environments such as those on roads. Kembhavi et al. proposed that no satisfactory accuracy has been achieved in complex environments such as the City of San Francisco. Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) can learn rich features from the training data automatically and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many image classification databases. Though the DNN has shown robustness to distortion, it only extracts features of the same scale, and hence is insufficient to tolerate large-scale variance of object. In this letter, we present a hybrid DNN (HDNN), by dividing the maps of the last convolutional layer and the max-pooling layer of DNN into multiple blocks of variable receptive field sizes or max-pooling field sizes, to enable the HDNN to extract variable-scale features. Comparative experimental results indicate that our proposed HDNN significantly outperforms the traditional DNN on vehicle detection.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2014.2309695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2014.2309695","startPage":"1797","endPage":"1801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6814328/06778050.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Satellite Images by Hybrid Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Satellite Images by Hybrid Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","volume":"11","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14299646","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6778050/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91338202"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316300"},{"fundingName":"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"XDA06030300"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Detection in Satellite Images by Hybrid Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"lgrs-chen-2309695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109596S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6814328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"371","xplore-issue":"6814328","articleId":"6778050","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6778061,"authors":[{"name":"Noriko Kawakami","affiliation":["Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric Industrial Systems Corporation, Fuchu, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6949174/6778061/kawak-2313657-small.gif","p":["\nNoriko Kawakami (M'95) received the B.S. degree in physics from Sophia\nUniversity, Tokyo, Japan, in 1982 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Tokyo Institute of Technology,\nMeguro, Japan, in 2008, based on the work of control systems for large-capacity self-commutated converters.","In 1982, she joined Toshiba Corporation and was engaged in developing and designing large-capacity power electronics\nequipment.

Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are being considered as a countermeasure for this issue. A modular multilevel cascade converter (MMCC) is expected as a power conversion circuit for BESSs because each bridge cell can control the state of charge of a battery unit, independent of that of another one, and the harmonic current generated is low enough to eliminate the ac filter, normally installed on conventional two-level converters, from the MMCC. This paper describes the development of a real-scale (500 kW) single-star-bridge-cell-based MMCC for BESSs and reports successful test results obtained from a downscaled grid model and a 6.6-kV

However, EM faces a local convergence problem in HMM estimation. This paper attempts to overcome this problem of EM and proposes hybrid metaheuristic approaches to EM for HMM. In our earlier research, a hybrid of a constraint-based evolutionary learning approach to EM (CEL-EM) improved HMM estimation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid simulated annealing stochastic version of EM (SASEM) that combines simulated annealing (SA) with EM. The novelty of our approach is that we develop a mathematical reformulation of HMM estimation by introducing a stochastic step between the EM steps and combine SA with EM to provide better control over the acceptance of stochastic and EM steps for better HMM estimation. We also extend our earlier work [1] and propose a second hybrid which is a combination of an EA and the proposed SASEM, (EA-SASEM). The proposed EA-SASEM uses the best constraint-based EA strategies from CEL-EM and stochastic reformulation of HMM. The complementary properties of EA and SA and stochastic reformulation of HMM of SASEM provide EA-SASEM with sufficient potential to find better estimation for HMM. To the best of our knowledge, this type of hybridization and mathematical reformulation have not been explored in the context of EM and HMM training. The proposed approaches have been evaluated through comprehensive experiments to justify their effectiveness in signal modeling using the speech corpus: TIMIT. Experimental results show that proposed approaches obtain higher recognition accuracies than the EM algorithm and CEL-EM as well.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2308917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/6898047/06778063.pdf","startPage":"1962","endPage":"1977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2308917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6898047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Metaheuristic Approaches to the Expectation Maximization for Estimation of the Hidden Markov Model for Signal Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778063","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778063/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Metaheuristic Approaches to the Expectation Maximization for Estimation of the Hidden Markov Model for Signal Modeling","volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581863","pubMedId":"24686310","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778063/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Metaheuristic Approaches to the Expectation Maximization for Estimation of the Hidden Markov Model for Signal Modeling","sourcePdf":"tcyb-huda-2308917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17353S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6898047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6898047","articleId":"6778063","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6778065,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6895322/6778065/6778065-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sheng Wu (S'13) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

To achieve this goal, we leverage message passing algorithms over the factor graph that represents the multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems and approximate the original discrete messages with continuous Gaussian messages through the use of the minimum Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence criterion. Several signal processing techniques are then proposed to achieve near-optimal performance at low complexity. First, the principle of expectation propagation is employed to compute the approximate Gaussian messages, where the symbol belief is approximated by a Gaussian distribution and then the approximate message is calculated from the Gaussian approximate belief. In addition, the approximate symbol belief can be computed by the a posteriori probabilities fed back from channel decoders, which reduces the complexity dramatically. Second, the first-order approximation of the message is utilized to further simplify the message updating, leading to an algorithm that is equivalent to the AMP algorithm proposed by Donoho Finally, the message updating is further simplified using the central-limit theorem. Compared with the single tree search sphere decoder (STS-SD) and the iterative (turbo) minimum mean-square error based soft interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) in the literature through extensive simulations, the proposed message passing algorithms can achieve a near-optimal performance while the complexity is decreased by tens of times for a 64 \u00d7 64 MIMO system. In addition, it is shown that the proposed message passing algorithms exhibit desirable tradeoffs between performance and complexity for a low-dimensional MIMO system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778065/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","volume":"8","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14581808","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6778065/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Iterative Detection for Large-Scale Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems Using Approximate Message Passing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91338101, 61021001 and 61132002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Iterative Detection for Large-Scale Multiuser MIMO-OFDM Systems Using Approximate Message Passing","sourcePdf":"jstsp-huang-2313766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148425S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6895322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6895322","articleId":"6778065","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6778066,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Etzlinger","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and RF-Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6809867/6778066/6778066-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bernhard Etzlinger (S'10) received the Dipl.-Ing.

Using two different kinds of feed, 3-D-pyramidal (wideband) horn and 2 \u00d7 2 planar microstrip array (narrowband) antenna, the radiation performances of the two collimating structures are investigated.

To alleviate WSN battery maintenance requirements, piezoelectric devices are implemented to harvest vibration energy. However, significant challenges remain unresolved with regard to harvesting from time-varying vibrations in environments where harvestable energy is unpredictable. This paper presents a new integrated piezoelectric energy harvesting system. An adaptive impedance matching maximum power point tracking technique is proposed to improve harvesting efficiency. An adaptive on-time dc-dc controller with pulse skipping modulation is also employed. To retain reasonable efficiency in such low power applications, the controller is designed with ultralow power analog circuits and zero bias current dynamic circuits, with a total quiescent current of only 450 nA. The design is fabricated and verified on a 0.25-\u03bcm CMOS process. It is capable of harvesting time-varying piezoelectric energy ranging of 12 \u03bcW to 1.1 mW. In comparison with quasi-resistive impedance matching, a harvesting improvement of more than two times is achieved. Thanks to the low power design effort, it achieves greater than 70% efficiency from 80 \u03bcW to 1.1 mW.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2313738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2313738","startPage":"632","endPage":"643","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6917239/06778073.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6917239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 12-\u03bcW to 1.1-mW AIM Piezoelectric Energy Harvester for Time-Varying Vibrations With 450-nA -","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"A 12-\u03bcW to 1.1-mW AIM Piezoelectric Energy Harvester for Time-Varying Vibrations With 450-nA <inline-formula><tex-math>$I_{\\bm Q}$</tex-math></inline-formula>","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14648195","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6778073/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"DGE-1147385 and CCF-1255754"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 12-\u03bcW to 1.1-mW AIM Piezoelectric Energy Harvester for Time-Varying Vibrations With 450-nA <inline-formula><tex-math>$I_{\\bm Q}$</tex-math></inline-formula>","sourcePdf":"tpel-ma-2313738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07362S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6917239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6917239","articleId":"6778073","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6778074,"authors":[{"name":"Todd A.

Conventional stabilizer codes are equivalent to self-orthogonal symplectic codes. In contrast, EAQEC codes do not require self-orthogonality, which greatly simplifies their construction. We show how any classical binary or quaternary block code can be made into an EAQEC code. We provide a table of best known EAQEC codes with code length up to 10. With the self-orthogonality constraint removed, we see that the distance of an EAQEC code can be better than any standard quantum error-correcting code with the same fixed net yield. In a quantum computation setting, EAQEC codes give rise to catalytic quantum codes, which assume a subset of the qubits are noiseless. We also give an alternative construction of EAQEC codes by making classical entanglement-assisted codes coherent.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2313559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6816018/06778074.pdf","startPage":"3073","endPage":"3089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2313559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Catalytic Quantum Error Correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Catalytic Quantum Error Correction","volume":"60","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14301815","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778074/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778074/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-0448658"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECS-0507270, CCF-0524811 and CCF-0545845"},{"fundingName":"UTS Chancellors Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship"},{"fundingName":"UTS Early Career Researcher Grants Scheme"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Catalytic Quantum Error Correction","sourcePdf":"tit-hsieh-2313559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113215S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6816018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6816018","articleId":"6778074","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6778085,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan Axvig","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Concordia College, Moorhead, MN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Nathan Axvig was born in Rugby, North Dakota in 1983.

The radar transceiver, consisting of a spectrum adjustable transmitter and a 100-ps resolution 4-channel sampling receiver, successfully demonstrates in/outdoor human walk tracing, stride-rate, and respiration measurements. The 4-channel sampling receiver, which is robust against pulse distortion, utilizes track and hold samplers and integrators while sharing a single low noise amplifier. By adopting embedded control logic, the sampling receiver achieves control flexibility as well as improved performance. A repetitive reception mode can proportionally increase the SNR of the receive pulse at the cost of a longer pulse acquisition time. DC offset and low-frequency coherent noise problems caused by on-board control clock signals are resolved with the radar architecture.

Cognitive mobile networks with small cells are important techniques for meeting the high-data-rate requirements and improving the energy efficiency of mobile multimedia communications. However, most existing works do not consider the power grid, which provides electricity to mobile networks. Currently, the power grid is experiencing a significant shift from the traditional grid to the smart grid. In the smart grid environment, only considering energy efficiency may not be sufficient since the dynamics of the smart grid will have significant impacts on mobile networks. In this paper, we study green cognitive mobile networks with small cells in the smart grid environment. Unlike most existing studies on cognitive networks, where only the radio spectrum is sensed, our cognitive networks sense not only the radio spectrum environment but also the smart grid environment, based on which power allocation and interference management for multimedia communications are performed. We formulate the problems of electricity price decision, energy-efficient power allocation, and interference management as a three-stage Stackelberg game. A homogeneous Bertrand game with asymmetric costs is used to model price decisions made by the electricity retailers. A backward induction method is used to analyze the proposed Stackelberg game. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly reduce operational expenditure and CO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n emissions in cognitive mobile networks with small cells for multimedia communications.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2313604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6832681/06778102.pdf","startPage":"2115","endPage":"2126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2313604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6832681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green Cognitive Mobile Networks With Small Cells for Multimedia Communications in the Smart Grid Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778102/","displayDocTitle":"Green Cognitive Mobile Networks With Small Cells for Multimedia Communications in the Smart Grid Environment","volume":"63","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Jun 2014","accessionNumber":"14379511","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778102/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Huawei Technologies Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green Cognitive Mobile Networks With Small Cells for Multimedia Communications in the Smart Grid Environment","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2313604-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123027S","chronDate":"Jun  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6832681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6832681","articleId":"6778102","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6778106,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Biagi","affiliation":["Department of Information, Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6949175/6778106/biagi-2313653-small.gif","p":["\nMauro Biagi (S'99\u2013M'05\u2013SM'11) received the Laurea degree in\ncommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication theory from Sapienza University of Rome,\nRome, Italy.","Since 2006, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Information, Electronics and Telecommunications\nEngineering, Sapienza University of Rome.

According to sensed interference, each secondary user autonomously tries to access the grid following a multiple-division principle, i.e., by properly shaping the signal in the code, time, and frequency domains. In detail, this is realized by processing the WVT to derive the shaping mask (and the matching algorithm) that allows the filling up of the \u201ctime spectrum holes.\u201d Numerical simulations and a test-bed implementation show how the proposed scheme outperforms selected state-of-the-art approaches while still presenting an affordable computational cost.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2313653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949175","startPage":"4248","endPage":"4264","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6949175/06778106.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WiVCoRA: Wigner\u2013Ville Cognitive Radio Access for Secondary Nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6778106/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"WiVCoRA: Wigner\u2013Ville Cognitive Radio Access for Secondary Nodes","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14735186","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WiVCoRA: Wigner\u2013Ville Cognitive Radio Access for Secondary Nodes","sourcePdf":"tvt-biagi-2313653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10421S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6949175","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6949175","articleId":"6778106","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"EU","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6778109,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Roemer","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Institute of Information Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Roemer","id":"37295437800"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Institute of Information Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"},{"name":"Giovanni Del Galdo","affiliation":["Ilmenau University of Technology, Institute of Information Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Del Galdo","id":"37427000100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6778109","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1172},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Standards","Noise","Signal processing algorithms","Parameter estimation","Performance analysis","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","matrix algebra","mean square error methods","parameter estimation","singular value decomposition","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace based parameter estimation","explicit first-order expansion","estimation error","signal subspace","higher order singular value decomposition","HOSVD","noisy observation matrix","matrix based ESPRIT-type algorithms","tensor based ESPRIT-type algorithms","arbitrary ESPRIT-type algorithms","R-D standard tensor ESPRIT","R-D unitary tensor ESPRIT","mean square error","MSE","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","tensors","subspace methods","performance analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a generic framework for the asymptotic performance analysis of subspace-based parameter estimation schemes.

Due to the randomness of batteries' swapping and charging patterns, the load demand of the BSS has a stochastic nature. It is necessary to investigate the charging load characteristics of BSS to guide the coordinated battery charging for mitigating the impact of disorderly charging behaviors on the distribution network. Under the uncontrolled swapping and charging scenario, four variables are essential: 1) hourly number of EVs for battery swapping; 2) the charging start time; 3) the travel distance; and 4) the charging duration. Taking these factors into account, a novel model based on Monte Carlo simulation is presented to estimate uncontrolled energy consumption of the BSS. Then, a generic nonparametric method for the estimation of prediction uncertainty of charging load demand is introduced. Adopting an actual typical BSS as an example, the simulation results show that the proposed prediction methods of the BSS charging load and probabilistic interval are suitable for forecasting the horizon 24 h ahead.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6861487/06778111.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2308990","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1917","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2308990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Modeling and Forecasting of Load Demand for Electric Bus Battery-Swap Station","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6778111/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14469300","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Modeling and Forecasting of Load Demand for Electric Bus Battery-Swap Station","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-dai-2308990-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094537S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6861487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6861487","articleId":"6778111","onlineDate":"25 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6778171,"authors":[{"name":"Rehan Khan","affiliation":["Centers of Excellence in Science and Applied Technologies (CESAT), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rehan","lastName":"Khan","id":"37086763548"},{"name":"Syed Asif Ali","affiliation":["Centers of Excellence in Science and Applied Technologies (CESAT), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed Asif","lastName":"Ali","id":"37086760573"},{"name":"Muahmmad Zahid Hammad","affiliation":["Centers of Excellence in Science and Applied Technologies (CESAT), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muahmmad Zahid","lastName":"Hammad","id":"37086762218"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2319-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-1403"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1411"}],"articleNumber":"6778171","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Doppler effect","Receivers","Oceans","Acoustic beams","Channel models","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beam steering","distortion","Doppler effect","Doppler measurement","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steering sinusoids","underwater acoustic communication","underwater channel","wireless information exchange","complex communication design","signal degradation problem","sea","nonuniform dynamics","acoustic subcarrier","intercarrier interference","signal distortion","erratic distortion","Doppler factor","aquatic variations tracking","OFDM approach","dynamic effects","relative motion measurement","Matlab simulation","self-induced Doppler spread","Bellhop ray tracing program","static multipath channel model generation"]}],"abstract":"The underwater channel poses various challenges for the wireless information exchange as it offers complex communication design. OFDM, being a best viable solution for high rate and efficient underwater communication scheme, also faces signal degradation problems due to the dynamics nature of Sea. These non-uniform dynamics due to the wind or the platform motion are critical for the acoustic subcarriers (i.e. low frequency and low speed) and may cause inter-carrier interference which results distortion of the entire signal. In order to avoid these erratic distortions, proper tracking of relative change in terms of Doppler factor have to be incorporated in the design. The communication design must be capable enough to track aquatic variations and compensate the effects in an efficient way. In this article, a novel OFDM approach based on steering sinusoids is presented which may be able to trace and rectify the fast oceanic variations incurred with in a symbol length. The steering sinusoids are used to check the dynamic effects imposed by the channel and the recorded variations (either uniform or non-uniform) are further utilized to mitigate the Doppler spread. The algorithm is computationally very efficient and gives low latency period as compare to the two-step approach. The placement of the appended sinusoids among subcarriers is depended upon the measure of relative motion and the level of precise tracking i.e. tradeoff have to be considered. The proposed scheme is analyzed in the MATLAB simulation with self-induced Doppler and Bellhop ray tracing program is also executed to generate static multipath channel models. The simulation results endorsed the efficient performance of the proposed algorithm and suggested for the practical evaluation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM with steering sinusoids for underwater acoustic communication","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 11th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences & Technology (IBCAST) Islamabad, Pakistan, 14th - 18th January, 2014","doi":"10.1109/IBCAST.2014.6778171","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 11th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences & Technology (IBCAST) Islamabad, Pakistan, 14th - 18th January, 2014","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766338/6778084/06778171.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IBCAST.2014.6778171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"OFDM with steering sinusoids for underwater acoustic communication","conferenceDate":"14-18 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778171/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197102","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM with steering sinusoids for underwater acoustic communication","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"6111thIBCAST2014UTRehanKhan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056655S","chronDate":"14-18 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766338","isNumber":"6778084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766338","xplore-issue":"6778084","articleId":"6778171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6778172,"authors":[{"name":"Umar Hamid","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Science and Applied Technologies, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Umar","lastName":"Hamid","id":"38667223900"},{"name":"Rahim Ali Qamar","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Science and Applied Technologies, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rahim Ali","lastName":"Qamar"},{"name":"Kashif Waqas","affiliation":["FAST, National University of Computer and Emerging Science, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Kashif","lastName":"Waqas","id":"38109524800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2319-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2151-1403"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-1411"}],"articleNumber":"6778172","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4567},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Arrays","Frequency-domain analysis","Time-domain analysis","Interpolation","Multiple signal classification","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain beamforming techniques","frequency-domain beamforming techniques","sensor array processing","execution time","general purpose processors","Matlab simulations","delay-and-sum beamforming","interpolation beamforming","quadrature beamforming","single-beam beamforming","multibeam beamforming","high resolution beamforming techniques","beam width","MUSIC beamforming","Root-MUSIC beamforming","sensor spacing","array frequency","time samples","sampling rate","FFT algorithms","IFFT algorithms","inverse fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sensor arrays","time-domain beamforming","frequency-domain beamforming","high resolution beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778172","doi":"10.1109/IBCAST.2014.6778172","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 11th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences & Technology (IBCAST) Islamabad, Pakistan, 14th - 18th January, 2014","abstract":"This paper aims to provide performance comparison of various time-domain and frequency-domain beamforming techniques in terms of their execution time on general purpose processors along with the hardware considerations and their processing requirements.

Similarly MATLAB simulations have been developed for frequency-domain beamforming techniques that include single-beam and multi-beam beamforming. High resolution beamforming techniques are used to obtain better spatial resolution for sensor arrays in comparison to their beam width. MATLAB simulations have been developed for high resolution beamforming techniques that include MUSIC and Root-MUSIC beamforming.

However, increasing the channel distortion by increasing the channel order causes performance degradation of LS estimator for comb-type pilot insertion scheme.","doi":"10.1109/IBCAST.2014.6778180","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 11th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences & Technology (IBCAST) Islamabad, Pakistan, 14th - 18th January, 2014","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2014 11th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences & Technology (IBCAST) Islamabad, Pakistan, 14th - 18th January, 2014","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766338/6778084/06778180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IBCAST.2014.6778180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778084","startPage":"420","endPage":"424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LS estimator: Performance analysis for block-type and comb-type channel estimation in OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LS estimator: Performance analysis for block-type and comb-type channel estimation in OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778180/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197139","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6778180/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LS estimator: Performance analysis for block-type and comb-type channel estimation in OFDM system","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"7011thIBCAST2014WCRLatifUllahKhan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048893S","chronDate":"14-18 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6766338","isNumber":"6778084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766338","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6778084","articleId":"6778180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6778192,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The applications of person re-identification include security, surveillance, multi-camera tracking, etc. In a real-world scenario, person re-identification is challenging due to the dramatic changes in a subject's appearance in terms of pose, illumination, background, and occlusion. Existing approaches either try to design robust features to identify a subject across different views or learn distance metrics to maximize the similarity between different views of the same person and minimize the similarity between different views of different persons. In this paper, we aim at improving the re-identification performance by reranking the returned results based on soft biometric attributes, such as gender, which can describe probe and gallery subjects at a higher level. During reranking, the soft biometric attributes are detected and attribute-based distance scores are calculated between pairs of images by using a regression model. These distance scores are used for reranking the initially returned matches. Experiments on a benchmark database with different baseline re-identification methods show that reranking improves the recognition accuracy by moving upwards the returned matches from gallery that share the same soft biometric attributes as the probe subject.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2013-Nov. 1 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778216/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14197222","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778216/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving person re-identification by soft biometrics based reranking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving person re-identification by soft biometrics based reranking","confLoc":"Palm Springs, CA","sourcePdf":"031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072268S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2013-Nov. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766836","isNumber":"6778199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766836","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6778199","articleId":"6778216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6778226,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9dric Bourrasset","affiliation":["Institut Pascal, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Fd, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9dric","lastName":"Bourrasset","id":"37085468563"},{"name":"Jocelyn S\u00e9rot","affiliation":["Institut Pascal, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Fd, France"],"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"S\u00e9rot","id":"37594468700"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Berry","affiliation":["Institut Pascal, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Fd, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Berry","id":"37339685500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2164-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6778226","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778226","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Hardware","Smart cameras","Protocols","Programming","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","field programmable gate arrays","high level languages","intelligent sensors","middleware","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based smart camera mote","pervasive wireless network","image sensors","transparent middleware decision","embedded real-time operating system","domain specific high-level programming language"]}],"abstract":"Smart camera networks raise challenging issues in many fields of research, including vision processing, communication protocols, distributed algorithms or power management. The ever increasing resolution of image sensors entails huge amounts of data, far exceeding the bandwidth of current networks and thus forcing smart camera nodes to process raw data into useful information. Consequently, on-board processing has become a key issue for the expansion of such networked systems. In this context, FPGA-based platforms, supporting massive, fine grain data parallelism, offer large opportunities. Besides, the concept of a middleware, providing services for networking, data transfer, dynamic loading or hardware abstraction, has emerged as a means of harnessing the hardware and software complexity of smart camera nodes. In this paper, we prospect the development of a new kind of smart cameras, wherein FPGAs provide high performance processing and general purpose processors support middleware services. In this approach, FPGA devices can be reconfigured at run-time through the network both from explicit user request and transparent middleware decision. An embedded real-time operating system is in charge of the communication layer, and thus can autonomously decide to use a part of the FPGA as an available processing resource. The classical programmability issue, a significant obstacle when dealing with FPGAs, is addressed by resorting to a domain specific high-level programming language (CAPH) for describing operations to be implemented on FPGAs.","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras (ICDSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras (ICDSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766836/6778199/06778226.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSC.2013.6778226","doi":"10.1109/ICDSC.2013.6778226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based smart camera mote for pervasive wireless network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based smart camera mote for pervasive wireless network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778226/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6778226/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14197214","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2013-Nov. 1 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based smart camera mote for pervasive wireless network","confLoc":"Palm Springs, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11622S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2013-Nov. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766836","isNumber":"6778199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766836","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6778199","articleId":"6778226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6778230,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre-Jean Lapray","affiliation":["LE2I UMR 6306, Univ Burgundy, Dijon, France"],"firstName":"Pierre-Jean","lastName":"Lapray","id":"37888734900"},{"name":"Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Heyrman","affiliation":["LE2I UMR 6306, Univ Burgundy, Dijon, France"],"firstName":"Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my","lastName":"Heyrman","id":"37550319300"},{"name":"Matthieu Ross\u00e9","affiliation":["LE2I UMR 6306, Univ Burgundy, Dijon, France"],"firstName":"Matthieu","lastName":"Ross\u00e9","id":"37662270000"},{"name":"Dominique Ginhac","affiliation":["LE2I UMR 6306, Univ Burgundy, Dijon, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Ginhac","id":"37550324400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2164-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6778230","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Memory management","Dynamic range","Real-time systems","Hardware","Cameras","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","field programmable gate arrays","intelligent sensors","storage management","video cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based smart camera","high dynamic range real time video","high dynamic range scene information","human visual system","light intensity","dark areas","bright areas","imaging technique","HDR live video colour stream","standard LDR CMOS sensor","Virtex 6 FPGA board","hardware architecture","multiple exposure control","memory management unit","tone mapping","picture size 1.3 Mpixel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778230","abstract":"A camera is able to capture only a part of a high dynamic range scene information. The same scene can be fully perceived by the human visual system. This is true especially for real scenes where the difference in light intensity between the dark areas and bright areas is high. The imaging technique which can overcome this problem is called HDR (High Dynamic Range). It produces images from a set of multiple LDR images (Low Dynamic Range), captured with different exposure times. This technique appears as one of the most appropriate and a cheap solution to enhance the dynamic range of captured environments. We developed an FPGA-based smart camera that produces a HDR live video colour stream from three successive acquisitions.

However, the use of cameras is often associated with privacy concerns and resource limitations. In order to alleviate these problems, anomaly detection by fusion of an accelerometer and a passive infrared (PIR) sensor can be employed to trigger the corresponding camera for further analysis only as the need arises. This paper discusses the combination of these off-the-shelf sensors to detect specific anomalous activities. In particular, an example of detecting an irregular user in the work environment is presented. We describe how to extract expressive features from both modalities and combine them to train a classifier on highly imbalanced datasets. The experimental results over real-life data show the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalous activities and therefore potentially reducing the use of cameras.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSC.2013.6778237","publicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras (ICDSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Seventh International Conference on Distributed Smart Cameras (ICDSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766836/6778199/06778237.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSC.2013.6778237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting anomalous activities by fusion of accelerometer and passive infrared sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2013-Nov. 1 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778237/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting anomalous activities by fusion of accelerometer and passive infrared sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14197219","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778237/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-1 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting anomalous activities by fusion of accelerometer and passive infrared sensor","confLoc":"Palm Springs, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091755S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2013-Nov. 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766836","isNumber":"6778199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766836","xplore-issue":"6778199","articleId":"6778237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6778245,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9dric Bourrasset","affiliation":["UMR 6602 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Fd, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9dric","lastName":"Bourrasset","id":"37085468563"},{"name":"Luca Maggianiy","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Toscana, IT"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Maggianiy"},{"name":"Jocelyn S\u00e9rot","affiliation":["UMR 6602 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Fd, France"],"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"S\u00e9rot","id":"37594468700"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Berry","affiliation":["UMR 6602 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Clermont-Fd, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Berry","id":"37339685500"},{"name":"Paolo Pagano","affiliation":["CNIT, National Laboratory of Photonic Networks, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Pagano","id":"38504861800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2164-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6778245","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":456},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart cameras","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Image sensors","Conferences","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computer vision","field programmable gate arrays","general purpose computers","intelligent sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed FPGA-based smart camera architecture","computer vision applications","general purpose processor","image processing","image resolution","massive parallelism capabilities","full reconfigurable pipeline","softcore"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778245","abstract":"Smart camera networks (SCN) raise challenging issues in many fields of research, including vision processing, communication protocols, distributed algorithms or power management.

In this context, smart camera have first embedded general purpose processor (GPP) for image processing. Since image resolution increases, GPPs have reached their limit to maintain real-time processing constraint. More recently, FPGA-based platforms have been studied for their massive parallelism capabilities.

Furthermore, a generalized framework is developed to detect abnormal crowd behavior using motion influence matrix. The proposed method has an advantage of that does not require any human detection or segmentation method which make it robust to human detection error by using optical flows which is extracted from two continuous frames. In this model, a normal behavior is presented by a low motion influence value. On the other hand, a high motion influence value indicates occurrence of abnormal behavior. Spatio-temporal cuboids are extracted from the motion influence matrix to measure the unusualness of the frame. Two different kinds of abnormal behaviors are dealt in this research: global abnormal behavior and local abnormal behavior. For t quantitative measurement of effectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluate our algorithm on two datasets: UMN and UCSD for global and local abnormal behavior, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the competing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777805/6778251/06778292.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"114","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition","doi":"10.1109/ACPR.2013.30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACPR.2013.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crowd Behavior Representation Using Motion Influence Matrix for Anomaly Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Computer vision","Feature extraction","Force","Pattern recognition","Conferences","Legged locomotion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","matrix algebra","multimedia computing","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crowd behavior representation","motion influence matrix","anomaly detection","crowd video","human perception","block-level motion vectors","crowd movement","generalized framework","abnormal crowd behavior","segmentation method","human detection error","optical flows","spatio-temporal cuboids","global abnormal behavior","local abnormal behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Crowd analysis","video surveillance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Crowd Behavior Representation Using Motion Influence Matrix for Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778292/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14197988","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crowd Behavior Representation Using Motion Influence Matrix for Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"2190a110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053151S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777805","isNumber":"6778251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777805","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6778251","articleId":"6778292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6778297,"authors":[{"name":"Dihong Gong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Dihong","lastName":"Gong","id":"37086760439"},{"name":"Jiangyu Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Jiangyu","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086761990"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2190-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0730-6512"}],"articleNumber":"6778297","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Correlation","Vectors","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum correlation feature descriptor","heterogeneous face recognition","HFR","probe face images matching","alternate imaging modality","near infrared face images","photographs","surveillance","forensics","face recognition community","within-class discrepancy","modality differences","gallery images","adaptive feature descriptor","feature extraction stage","NIR face images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous face recognition","feature descriptor","correlation analysis"]}],"abstract":"Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) refers to matching probe face images to a gallery of face images taken from alternate imaging modality, for example matching near infrared (NIR) face images to photographs.

It has been used in many recognition tasks including handwritten digits, Chinese words and traffic signs, etc. However, training and test DNN are time-consuming tasks. In practical vehicle detection application, both speed and accuracy are required. So increasing the speeds of DNN while keeping its high accuracy has significant meaning for many recognition and detection applications. We introduce parallel branches into the DNN. The maps of the layers of DNN are divided into several parallel branches, each branch has the same number of maps. There are not direct connections between different branches. Our parallel DNN (PNN) keeps the same structure and dimensions of the DNN, reducing the total number of connections between maps. The more number of branches we divide, the more swift the speed of the PNN is, the conventional DNN becomes a special form of PNN which has only one branch. Experiments on large vehicle database showed that the detection accuracy of PNN dropped slightly with the speed increasing. Even the fastest PNN (10 times faster than DNN), whose branch has only two maps, fully outperformed the traditional methods based on features (such as HOG, LBP). In fact, PNN provides a good solution way for compromising the speed and accuracy requirements in many applications.","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777805/6778251/06778306.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Satellite Images by Parallel Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/ACPR.2013.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACPR.2013.33","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Satellite Images by Parallel Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14198128","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6778306/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Detection in Satellite Images by Parallel Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"2190a181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068944S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777805","isNumber":"6778251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777805","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6778251","articleId":"6778306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":6778319,"authors":[{"name":"Lihu Xiao","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lihu","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37086675871"},{"name":"Zhenan Sun","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenan","lastName":"Sun","id":"37280349600"},{"name":"Ran He","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"He","id":"37589818700"},{"name":"Tieniu Tan","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tieniu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274122900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2190-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0730-6512"}],"articleNumber":"6778319","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","image sensors","image texture","iris recognition","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iris recognition systems","iris sensors","illumination wavelength","iris texture patterns","margin based feature selection","feature weighting factors","cost function minimization","iris images","optimization problem","linear programming","Notre Dame cross sensor iris database","CASIA cross sensor iris database"]}],"abstract":"The wide deployments of iris recognition systems promote the emergence of different types of iris sensors.

In this paper, we propose a margin based feature selection method for cross-sensor iris recognition. This method learns coupled feature weighting factors by minimizing a cost function, which aims at selecting the feature set to represent the intrinsic characteristics of iris images from different sensors.

Early diagnosis is crucial, since if detected early, it can be cured through a simple excision. In this paper, we present an effective approach to melanoma classification from dermoscopic images of skin lesions. First, we perform automatic border detection to delineate the lesion from the background skin. Shape features are then extracted from this border, while colour and texture features are obtained based on a division of the image into clinically significant regions. The derived features are then used in a pattern classification stage for which we employ a dedicated ensemble learning approach to address the class imbalance in the training data. Our classifier committee trains individual classifiers on balanced subspaces, removes redundant predictors based on a diversity measure and combines the remaining classifiers using a neural network fuser. Experimental results on a large dataset of dermoscopic skin lesion images show our approach to work well, to provide both high sensitivity and specificity, and the use of our classifier ensemble to lead to statistically better recognition performance.","doi":"10.1109/ACPR.2013.102","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777805/6778251/06778346.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACPR.2013.102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Melanoma Classification Using Dermoscopy Imaging and Ensemble Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778346/","displayDocTitle":"Melanoma Classification Using Dermoscopy Imaging and Ensemble Learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14198027","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778346/","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Melanoma Classification Using Dermoscopy Imaging and Ensemble Learning","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"2190a386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098899S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777805","isNumber":"6778251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777805","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6778251","articleId":"6778346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6778365,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Deng","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Deng","id":"37086756059"},{"name":"Zhenhua Guo","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Guo","id":"37397436100"},{"name":"Youbin Chen","affiliation":["Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Youbin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37616543200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2190-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0730-6512"}],"articleNumber":"6778365","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"abstract":"Gabor features have been demonstrated to be very effective for face representation. Recently, non-sub sampled contour let transform (NSCT), which is a newly developed multi-resolution analysis tool based on contour let transform, is also used in facial image processing. In fact, the two image decomposition methods are performed from two different angles. To exploit complementarity of these features, in this paper, we propose a new face representation based on fusing local patterns of Gabor and NSCT. Firstly, we decompose face images using Gabor and NSCT respectively. Then all decomposition images are encoded by local texture descriptors to combine. In order to extract efficient features for feature fusion, we propose local Gabor difference features (LGDF) and local contour let difference features (LCDF) to represent the texture of decomposition images. Thirdly, after fusing LGDF and LCDF, block-based Fisher's linear discriminant (BFLD) is utilized to further reduce the dimensionality and improve discriminative power of the proposed method. Experiments on public databases demonstrate that the proposed LGDF and LCDF are very effective and our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Histograms","Feature extraction","Transforms","Lighting","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image representation","image resolution","image texture","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BFLD","block-based Fisher linear discriminant","LCDF","local contourlet difference feature","LGDF","feature fusion","feature extraction","texture descriptor","image decomposition method","facial image processing","multiresolution analysis tool","NSCT","face representation","face recognition","nonsubsampled contourlet transform","local Gabor difference feature","local pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","Gabor","contourlet","features fusion","Fisher's linear discriminant"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACPR.2013.58","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777805/6778251/06778365.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACPR.2013.58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusing Local Patterns of Gabor and Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fusing Local Patterns of Gabor and Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform for Face Recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778365/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778365/","accessionNumber":"14198021","conferenceDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusing Local Patterns of Gabor and Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform for Face Recognition","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"2190a481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052237S","chronDate":"5-8 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777805","isNumber":"6778251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777805","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6778251","articleId":"6778365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6778411,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Kumar","affiliation":["Center for Visual Information Technology, IIIT, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37076593200"},{"name":"Anoop Namboodiri","affiliation":["Center for Visual Information Technology, IIIT, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Anoop","lastName":"Namboodiri","id":"37268964700"},{"name":"C.V.

These methods rely on the use of an over-complete basis set for representing an image. This often assumes the availability of a large number of labeled training images, especially for high dimensional data. In many practical problems, the number of labeled training samples are very limited leading to significant degradations in classification performance. To address the problem of lack of training samples, we propose a semi-supervised algorithm that labels the unlabeled samples through a multi-stage label propagation combined with sparse representation. In this representation, each image is decomposed as a linear combination of its nearest basis images, which has the advantage of both locality and sparsity.

In this method the harmonic injecting devices are identified using their distinct `harmonic signatures' extracted from the input current waveform. The complexity increases with increase in the number of loads and their combinations. Such automated non-intrusive device identification helps in monitoring and enhancing power quality. The performance of a neural network to a large extent depends upon the type of architecture used and their learning algorithm. Eight commonly used domestic loads are identified and their harmonic signatures obtained. The data is used to design a Feed Forward neural networks (FF) and Single Neuron Cascade networks (SNC). The performance of these models was compared in terms of their recognition accuracy and network complexity. Both the networks are shown to perform well in terms of accuracy. However CC network has been found to be the most suitable architecture because of its low computational requirements and ease in design.","doi":"10.1109/ICCPEIC.2013.6778499","pdfPath":"/iel7/6766446/6778494/06778499.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"64","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy, Information and Communication (ICCPEIC)","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computation of Power, Energy, Information and Communication (ICCPEIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPEIC.2013.6778499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-intrusive harmonic source identification using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Non-intrusive harmonic source identification using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14197176","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6778499/","conferenceDate":"17-18 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-intrusive harmonic source identification using neural networks","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095503S","chronDate":"17-18 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6766446","isNumber":"6778494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6766446","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6778494","articleId":"6778499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6778510,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

The storage capacity of a data center is limited. Therefore, how to place data slices in appropriate data center proves to be an important factor influencing the platform ability. The data placement strategy we design in this paper takes the cooperation costs among data slices into account. It lowers the distributed transaction costs as much as possible, especially the cost differences among different distributed transactions. At the same time, this strategy also cares about the global load balance problem in data center. It is developed on the basis of genetic algorithm and ensures that the strategy can quickly converge to efficient data placement solutions. According to the result of the experiment, this strategy can better realize the global load balance and can save about 10% of the distributed cooperation costs when being compared with other strategies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data Placement Strategy Based on Genetic Algorithm in Cloud Computing Platform","publicationTitle":"2013 10th Web Information System and Application Conference","doi":"10.1109/WISA.2013.76","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th Web Information System and Application Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777803/6778588/06778667.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WISA.2013.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778588","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Data Placement Strategy Based on Genetic Algorithm in Cloud Computing Platform","conferenceDate":"10-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778667/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14197886","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data Placement Strategy Based on Genetic Algorithm in Cloud Computing Platform","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3219a369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059326S","chronDate":"10-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777803","isNumber":"6778588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777803","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6778588","articleId":"6778667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6778749,"authors":[{"name":"Mona Aggarwal","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"p":["Mona Aggarwal received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in electronics and communication engineering from Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar, India, and Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India, in 2003 and 2011 respectively.

The atmospheric turbulence channels are modeled by independent but not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d) Gamma-Gamma fading statistics with pointing error impairments.

We analyze the detection dynamics of some iterative detectors, namely soft-PIC, the Onsager-reaction-canceling parallel interference canceler (ORC-PIC) and the belief-propagation-based detector (BP-based detector), by the generating functional analysis (GFA). The GFA allows us to study the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics in the infinitely large system without assuming the independence of messages. We study the detection dynamics and the stationary estimates of an iterative algorithm. We also show the decoupling principle in iterative multiuser detection algorithms in the large-system limit. For a generic iterative multiuser detection algorithm with binary input, it is shown that the multiuser channel is equivalent to a bank of independent single-user additive non-Gaussian channels, whose signal-to-noise ratio degrades due to both the multiple-access interference and the Onsager reaction, at each stage of the algorithm. If an algorithm cancels the Onsager reaction, the equivalent single-user channels coincide with an additive white Gaussian noise channel. We also discuss ORC-PIC and the BP-based detector.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2313857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6816018/06778754.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2313857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6816018","startPage":"3645","endPage":"3670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating Functional Analysis for Iterative CDMA Multiuser Detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generating Functional Analysis for Iterative CDMA Multiuser Detectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14301805","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6778754/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas","grantNumber":"14084212"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research (B)","grantNumber":"25289114"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research (C)","grantNumber":"16500093, 22500136 and 25330264"},{"fundingName":"Encouragement of Young Scientists (B)","grantNumber":"18700230"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating Functional Analysis for Iterative CDMA Multiuser Detectors","sourcePdf":"tit-mimura-2313857-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153746S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6816018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6816018","articleId":"6778754","onlineDate":"26 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6778758,"authors":[{"name":"Hua-Jie Shao","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6803925/6778758/6778758-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hua-Jie Shao is currently a graduate student in Department of Control science and Engineering at Zhejiang University.

There are two main algorithms, the triangulation method and the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, for angle of arrival (AOA) based self-localization. The ML estimator requires a good initialization close to the true location to avoid divergence, while the triangulation method cannot obtain the closed-form solution with high efficiency. In this paper, we develop a set of efficient closed-form AOA based self-localization algorithms using auxiliary variables based methods. First, we formulate the self-localization problem as a linear least squares problem using auxiliary variables. Based on its closed-form solution, a new auxiliary variables based pseudo-linear estimator (AVPLE) is developed. By analyzing its estimation error, we present a bias compensated AVPLE (BCAVPLE) to reduce the estimation error. Then we develop a novel BCAVPLE based weighted instrumental variable (BCAVPLE-WIV) estimator to achieve asymptotically unbiased estimation of locations and orientations of unknown nodes based on prior knowledge of the AOA noise variance. In the case that the AOA noise variance is unknown, a new AVPLE based WIV (AVPLE-WIV) estimator is developed to localize the unknown nodes. Also, we develop an autonomous coordinate rotation (ACR) method to overcome the tangent instability of the proposed algorithms when the orientation of the unknown node is near \u03c0/2. We also derive the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the ML estimator. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the new algorithms achieve much higher localization accuracy than the triangulation method and avoid local minima and divergence in iterative ML estimators.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2314064","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6803925/06778758.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2314064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2580","endPage":"2594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Closed-Form Algorithms for AOA Based Self-Localization of Sensor Nodes Using Auxiliary Variables","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Closed-Form Algorithms for AOA Based Self-Localization of Sensor Nodes Using Auxiliary Variables","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778758/","volume":"62","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6778758/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14264385","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Closed-Form Algorithms for AOA Based Self-Localization of Sensor Nodes Using Auxiliary Variables","sourcePdf":"tsp-zhang-2314064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099794S","chronDate":"May15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6803925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6803925","articleId":"6778758","onlineDate":"26 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6778761,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6913590/6778761/xu-2313898-small.gif","p":["Yi Xu (S\u201911) received the B.S.degree in electronic information engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

We present a stochastic programming formulation of the problem, as well as a problem reformulation that greatly reduces computational complexity. In the cases of a single licensed channel and multiple licensed channels with channel bonding, we develop an optimal distributed algorithm with proven convergence and convergence speed. In the case of multiple channels without channel bonding, we develop a greedy algorithm with a proven performance bound.

A converged data link layer is presented between long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) and next-generation passive optical network (NGPON) topologies, extending beyond NGPON2. This is achieved by incorporating in a new protocol design, consistent mapping of LTE-A QCIs and OFDMA-PON queues. Novel inter-ONU algorithms have been developed, based on the distribution of weights to allocate subcarriers to both enhanced node B/optical network units (eNB/ONUs) and residential ONUs, sharing the same infrastructure. A weighted, intra-ONU scheduling mechanism is also introduced to control further the QoS across the network load. The inter and intra-ONU algorithms are both dynamic and adaptive, providing customized solutions to bandwidth allocation for different priority queues at different network traffic loads exhibiting practical fairness in bandwidth distribution. Therefore, middle and low priority packets are not unjustifiably deprived in favor of high priority packets at low network traffic loads. In addition the protocol adaptability allows the high priority queues to automatically over perform when the traffic load has increased and the available bandwidth needs to be rationally redistributed. Computer simulations have confirmed that following the application of adaptive weights the fairness index of the new scheme (representing the achieved throughput for each queue), has improved across the traffic load to above 0.9. Packet delay reduction of more than 40 ms has been recorded as a result for the low priority queues, while high priorities still achieve sufficiently low packet delays in the range of 20 to 30 ms.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2313980","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6808425/06778771.pdf","startPage":"1877","endPage":"1885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2313980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6808425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Heterogeneous OFDMA-PONs Featuring Intelligent LTE-A Traffic Queuing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778771/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Heterogeneous OFDMA-PONs Featuring Intelligent LTE-A Traffic Queuing","volume":"32","issue":"10","publicationDate":"May15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14267040","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778771/","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Heterogeneous OFDMA-PONs Featuring Intelligent LTE-A Traffic Queuing","sourcePdf":"jlt-lim-2313980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078162S","chronDate":"May15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6808425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6808425","articleId":"6778771","onlineDate":"26 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6778776,"authors":[{"name":"Liquan Shen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and System Application, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6913590/6778776/shen-2313892-small.gif","p":["Liquan Shen received the B.S. degree in automation control from Henan Polytechnic University, Shanyang, China, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information systems from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2001, 2005, and 2008, respectively.","He was with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, as a Visiting Professor from 2013 to 2014.

At each depth level, it enables SKIP mode, merge mode, inter 2N \u00d7 2N, inter 2N \u00d7 N, inter N \u00d7 2N, inter 2N \u00d7 nU, inter 2N \u00d7 nD, inter nL x 2N, inter nR \u00d7 2N, inter N \u00d7 N (only available for the smallest CU), intra 2N \u00d7 2N, and intra N \u00d7 N (only available for the smallest CU) in inter-frames. Similar to H.264/AVC, the mode decision process in HEVC is performed using all the possible depth levels (or CU sizes) and prediction modes to find the one with the least rate distortion (RD) cost using Lagrange multiplier. This achieves the highest coding efficiency, but leads to a very high computational complexity. Since the optimal prediction mode is highly content dependent, it is not efficient to use all the modes. In this paper, we propose a fast inter-mode decision algorithm for HEVC by jointly using the inter-level correlation of quadtree structure and the spatiotemporal correlation. There exist strong correlations of the prediction mode, the motion vector and RD cost between different depth levels and between spatially temporally adjacent CUs. We statistically analyze the prediction mode distribution at each depth level and the coding information correlation among the adjacent CUs. Based on the analysis results, three adaptive inter-mode decision strategies are proposed including early SKIP mode decision, prediction size correlation-based mode decision and RD cost correlation-based mode decision. Experimental results show that the proposed overall algorithm can save 49%-52% computational complexity on average with negligible loss of coding efficiency, exhibiting applicability to various types of video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2313892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6913590/06778776.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2313892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6913590","startPage":"1709","endPage":"1722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Inter-Mode Decision for HEVC Jointly Utilizing Inter-Level and Spatiotemporal Correlations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Inter-Mode Decision for HEVC Jointly Utilizing Inter-Level and Spatiotemporal Correlations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778776/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14648341","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6778776/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Shanghai Rising-Star Program","grantNumber":"11QA1402400"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"13ZZ069"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422111, 60832003, 60902085, 61171084, 61172096 and U1301257"},{"fundingName":"Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme","grantNumber":"299202"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Inter-Mode Decision for HEVC Jointly Utilizing Inter-Level and Spatiotemporal Correlations","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-shen-2313892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097176S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6913590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"6913590","articleId":"6778776","onlineDate":"26 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6778784,"authors":[{"name":"Roger E.

The aim of this paper is to present a view on how these imagers change the paradigm of wide-field near-infrared imaging (NIRI). Thanks to the large number of pixels that they offer and to their advanced time-resolved measurement capabilities, new approaches in the image reconstruction can be applied. A SPAD imager was integrated in a NIRI setup to demonstrate how it can improve spatial resolution in reconstructed images. The SPAD imager has a time resolution of 97 ps and a picosecond laser source with an average output power of 3 mW was employed. The large amount of data produced by this new setup could not directly be analyzed with state-of-the art image reconstruction algorithms. Therefore a new theoretical framework was developed. Simulations show that millimetric resolution is achievable with this setup. Experimental results have demonstrated that a resolution of at least 5 mm is possible with the current setup. A discussion about how different characteristics of the SPAD imagers affect the NIRI measurements is presented and possible future improvements are introduced.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6712939","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2944/6712939/06778785.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2014.2313983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2014.2313983","startPage":"291","endPage":"298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Photon Avalanche Diode Imagers Applied to Near-Infrared Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778785/","displayDocTitle":"Single-Photon Avalanche Diode Imagers Applied to Near-Infrared Imaging","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778785/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"14297290","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2014","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2014","externalId":"3800908","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"KFSP Tumor Oxygenation"},{"fundingName":"KFSP Molecular Imaging of the University of Zurich"},{"fundingName":"National Competence Center for Biomedical Imaging"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Photon Avalanche Diode Imagers Applied to Near-Infrared Imaging","sourcePdf":"jstqe-matapavia-2313983-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109558S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"6712939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6712939","articleId":"6778785","onlineDate":"26 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6778790,"authors":[{"name":"Yoann Altmann","affiliation":["University of Toulouse, Toulouse Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6807541/6778790/altma-2314022-small.gif","p":["Yoann Altmann (S'10\u2013M'14) was born in Toulouse, France, in 1987.

Hardware-oblivious hash join variants do not depend on hardware-specific parameters. Rather, they consider qualitative characteristics of modern hardware and are expected to achieve good performance on any technologically similar platform. The assumption behind these algorithms is that hardware is now good enough at hiding its own limitations-through automatic hardware prefetching, out-of-order execution, or simultaneous multi-threading (SMT)-to make hardware-oblivious algorithms competitive without the overhead of carefully tuning to the underlying hardware. Hardware-conscious implementations, such as (parallel) radix join, aim to maximally exploit a given architecture by tuning the algorithm parameters (e.g., hash table sizes) to the particular features of the architecture. The assumption here is that explicit parameter tuning yields enough performance advantages to warrant the effort required. This paper compares the two approaches under a wide range of workloads (relative table sizes, tuple sizes, effects of sorted data, etc.) and configuration parameters (VM page sizes, number of threads, number of cores, SMT, SIMD, prefetching, etc.). The results show that hardware-conscious algorithms generally outperform hardware-oblivious ones. However, on specific workloads and special architectures with aggressive simultaneous multi-threading, hardware-oblivious algorithms are competitive. The main conclusion of the paper is that, in existing multi-core architectures, it is still important to carefully tailor algorithms to the underlying hardware to get the necessary performance.

We compute the distortion loss as a function of dimensional variations and of lateral forces considered typical for cable packaging.

A special training sequence whose period in symbols is equal to the number of equalizer taps is used initially to achieve an open eye pattern. Rapid convergence, even over highly distorted channels, is obtained because an ideal reference sequence is available at the receiver, but it is not necessary to synchronize the ideal reference with the received sequence. The special choice of the training sequence automatically provides the synchronized ideal reference needed for fast convergence, but the resulting equalizer coefficients may be cyclically displaced from their proper positions. After the eye is opened by this process, the equalizer coefficients are rotated to their proper positions, and decision-directed equalization is used with either a longer training sequence or random data to achieve final tap settings. Adjustments during the training period can be made with a gradient-type algorithm or with stochastic adjustment techniques; an exact analysis is possible for both of these schemes. Cyclic equalization is shown to provide perfect equalization at evenly spaced points in the frequency domain.","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1975.tb02843.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","startPage":"369","endPage":"406","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6769435/06778860.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1975.tb02843.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6769435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic equalization \u2014 a new rapidly converging equalization technique for synchronous data communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1975","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic equalization \u2014 a new rapidly converging equalization technique for synchronous data communication","volume":"54","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 1975","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778860/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic equalization \u2014 a new rapidly converging equalization technique for synchronous data communication","sourcePdf":"bstj542369.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023095S","chronDate":"Feb.  1975","isNumber":"6769435","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"44","articleId":"6778860","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6778912,"authors":[{"name":"Chengmei Li","affiliation":["EECS, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6778912/6778912-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Chengmei, received her bachelor degree in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, P.R.

To solve this problem, a two-step time delay difference estimation scheme is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) multi-beam satellite system. We first divide a beam cell into some layered small sub-areas according to the different delay difference values. Then, two types of Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) preamble burst format are performed: the first one is for the fractional delay difference value measurement and the second one is for the integer part. Further, complete criteria for the designation of PRACH parameters are proposed and closed-form expressions of the system performance are also derived, including the false alarm probability and the missed detection probability. Finally, according to the numerical analysis, the method shows good performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication

When used in practice as cryptographic key generators, they need to be combined with an extraction technique to derive reliable bit strings (i.e., cryptographic key). An approach based on an error correcting code was proposed by Dodis et al. and is known as a fuzzy extractor. However, this method appears to be difficult for non-specialists to implement. In our recent study, we reported the results of some example implementations using PUF data and presented a detailed implementation diagram. In this paper, we describe a more efficient implementation method by replacing the hash function output with the syndrome from the BCH code. The experimental results show that the Hamming distance between two keys vary according to the key size and information-theoretic security has been achieved.","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","startPage":"23","endPage":"26","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778915","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06778915.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryptographie key generation from PUF data using efficient fuzzy extractors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778915/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cryptographie key generation from PUF data using efficient fuzzy extractors","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197673","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778915/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryptographie key generation from PUF data using efficient fuzzy extractors","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"021B010089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04621S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6778915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6778928,"authors":[{"name":"Abdou Khadre Diop","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cheikh Anta Diop University, Dakar, SENEGAL"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6778928/6778928-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Author Abdou Khadre DIOP was born the 10th of July 1979 in Pikine, Dakar, Senegal.

The works of LDiop and al [1], inspired by those of T. Filler [2] have shown that the LDPC codes are good candidates in minimizing the impact of insertion. This work is a continuation of the use of LDPC codes in steganography.

We consider three time-division multiple-access cooperative schemes by using embedded space time codes with various degrees of broadcasting and receiving collision. In this paper, we assume that base station and relay station are equipped two antennas and mobile stations have only one antenna. The relay station operates decode-and-forward mode for cooperative transmission. The base station broadcasts scalable video bit stream by encoding embedded space time codes with the assistance of relay. Upon the amount of received information of each cooperative scheme, Mobile stations get the corresponding efficient decoding. With the help of relayed information, base layer retrieves better protection for ensuring the basic quality of scalable video. Visual quality is refined by enhancement layers carried in transmitted signal. We investigate the diversity performance of various schemes in term of bit error rate. Scalable video performance is also provided for comparing and evaluating the effectiveness of scalable video transmission schemes. Based on the need of users, it's possible to select the suitable scheme for trading off between the protection of base and enhancement layers.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778955","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06778955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","startPage":"234","endPage":"238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of transmission schemes for scalable video over MIMO relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of transmission schemes for scalable video over MIMO relay networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778955/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197767","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6778955/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of transmission schemes for scalable video over MIMO relay networks","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"022D050522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052533S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6778955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6778957,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Kazemian","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer and Communication Engineering, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6778957/6778957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohsen Kazemian received his B.Sc. electrical and electronics engineering in 2007, and his M.Sc. telecommunications engineering from Islamic Azad University-Iran, in 2009.

in order to demonstrate its high spectral-efficiency in a satellite channel. The Luise and Reggiannini (L&R) algorithm is one of the frequency offset estimation methods suitable for use with the Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite (DVB-S2) standard, and has also been implemented in our PPM receiver. In order to provide sufficient performance at the lowest SNR of about -2 dB, it is recommended to average the correlation estimates over 2048 frames. In higher SNR regions however, such a large averaging size is unnecessary and by reducing the size, the system can be made more responsive to changes in the channel state. In order to reduce the latency, we propose to measure the average noise power and select an efficient frame averaging length using a look-up-table. We show that the benefits of the proposed adaptive architecture can be extended to short UW lengths through increasing the separation of the UW symbols. Performance results show that the size of the averaging window can be substantially reduced whilst maintaining a target BER.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778958","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06778958.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","startPage":"249","endPage":"254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive frequency offset estimation for practical satellite communication channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive frequency offset estimation for practical satellite communication channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778958/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197625","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6778958/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive frequency offset estimation for practical satellite communication channels","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"022F030039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054263S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6778958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6778959,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this work the focus is on path loss component, network topology, node density and performance of a node. The performance of connectivity between nodes in a dense network are analysed by deriving analytical models.

However, the proposed PS method has high computation complexity. To improve the computation complexity for the previous proposed PS method, this paper proposes a low-complexity PS method which can keep the better peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In the proposed PS method, the signals at the middle stages of an N-point radix IFFT using decimation in frequency (DIF) is considered for PS processing. This paper shows that the proposed method has a lower multiplicative complexity than conventional PS method with keeping the PAPR reduction performance. The proposed method is called PS based radix IFFT, where DIF-IFFT is assigned through different stages of the IFFT transform. This proposed method can reduce the multiplicative complexity relatively with keeping the similar PAPR reduction to other methods such as C-PTS and C-PS. The proposed method also can reduce the side information as compared with the C-PTS. This paper presents the various computer simulation results to verify the effectiveness of proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778963","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06778963.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity PS based radix IFFT method for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6778963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778963/","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity PS based radix IFFT method for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14209229","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778963/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity PS based radix IFFT method for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"022P030144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065246S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6778963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6778969,"authors":[{"name":"Jiajia Wang","affiliation":["Institution of Advanced Communications, EECS, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6778969/6778969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiajia Wang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Xi'an Communications Institute, Xi'an, P.

The conventional relay assists two sources to exchange their data via a DF protocol. The two jamming nodes are used to create interference signals to confuse the eavesdropper. Furthermore, the asymptotic performance of proposed scheme is analyzed in detail. Under the assumption that the relay can decode received signals perfectly and when the jamming power is higher than that of source nodes, we find that the proposed scheme has a high secrecy performance which is almost independent of the position of the eavesdropper.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","startPage":"300","endPage":"303","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06778969.pdf","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6778969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jammer selection for secure two-way DF relay communications with imperfect CSI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Jamming","Peer-to-peer computing","Educational institutions","Security","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jammer selection","secure two-way decode-and-forward relay communications","channel state information","CSI","jamming nodes","communication security","decode-and-forward protocol","source nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Jammer selection","physical layer security","two-way","DF relay","imperfect CSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Jammer selection for secure two-way DF relay communications with imperfect CSI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6778969/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6778969/","accessionNumber":"14197576","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jammer selection for secure two-way DF relay communications with imperfect CSI","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"022P090349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042348S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6778969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6778971,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Yong Lee","affiliation":["College of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6778971/6778971-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jae Yong Lee received B.S. degree in College of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Korea in 2013.

Cloud services are delivered from data centres located throughout the world. Cloud computing facilitates its consumers by providing virtual resources via internet. The rapid growth in field of \"cloud computing\" also increases severe security concerns. Security has remained a constant issue for Open Systems and internet, when we are talking about security, cloud really suffers. Lack of security is the only hurdle in wide adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing is surrounded by many security issues like securing data and examining the utilization of cloud by the cloud computing vendors. This paper proposes a scheme to securely store and access of data via internet. We have used ECC based PKI for certificate procedure because the use of ECC significantly reduces the computation cost, message size and transmission overhead over RSA based PKI as 160-bit key size in ECC provides comparable security with 1024-bit key in RSA. We have designed Secured Cloud Storage Framework (SCSF). In this framework, users not only can securely store and access data in cloud but also can share data with multiple users through the unsecure internet in a secured way. This scheme can ensure the security and privacy of the data in the cloud.","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06779015.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"527","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient and secured data storage scheme in cloud computing using ECC-based PKI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Elliptic curve cryptography","Elliptic curves","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","data privacy","open systems","public key cryptography","security of data","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secured data storage scheme","cloud computing","ECC-based PKI","cloud services","data centres","virtual resources","security concern","open systems","certificate procedure","computation cost","message size","transmission overhead","RSA based PKI","secured cloud storage framework","SCSF","unsecure Internet","data security","data privacy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud storage","Cloud computing","ECC","PKI","Certificate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An efficient and secured data storage scheme in cloud computing using ECC-based PKI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779015/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197772","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient and secured data storage scheme in cloud computing using ECC-based PKI","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"024C030422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064894S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6779023,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelhakim Khlifp","affiliation":["Innov'COM Laboratory, Sup'Com, University of Carthage, Tunis, Tunisia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6779023/6779023-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abdelhakim Khlifi was born in Dusseldorf, Germany, on January 07, 1984.

However, chaos communication system increases the number of transmitted symbols by spreading and transmitting information bits according to characteristic of chaos maps. So the research that improves data transmission speed is necessary for chaos communication system. If many antennas are applied to chaos communication system, the capacity of data is proportional to the number of antenna. So it is good way applying multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) to the chaos communication system. In this paper, we propose the correlation delay shift keying (CDSK) using 2\u00d72 MIMO technique and evaluate BER performance over Rayleigh MIMO fading channel. Lastly we evaluate BER performance applying the boss map with 2\u00d72 MIMO using MIMO detection algorithm such as zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE).","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06779026.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaos communication system using MIMO technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","MIMO","Bit error rate","Detection algorithms","Equations","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","data communication","error statistics","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos communication system","MIMO technique","digital communication system","chaos maps","data transmission speed","multiple-input and multiple-output","correlation delay shift keying","BER performance","Rayleigh MIMO fading channel","MIMO detection algorithm","zero forcing","minimum mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaos Communication System","CDSK","MIMO","Zero Forcing","MMSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Chaos communication system using MIMO technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779026/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197786","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaos communication system using MIMO technique","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"024F050304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056217S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6779060,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Hsu Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication, De Lin Institute of Technology, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6779060/6779060-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen-Hsu Hsieh was born at Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.

The interference suppression threshold plays a key role in the algorithm and affects system performance greatly. In this paper, the initial interference threshold is derived theoretically and then a novel FDAJ algorithm is proposed based on the iterative calculation of the threshold. With the iterative process, the optimal threshold for the interference suppression can be approached with little loss of valid signals; and the antijamming performance can be further improved. The simulation results validate well that our proposed iterative algorithm has superior performance for interference suppression. Finally, two FPGA-based implementations are presented: pipeline scheme and iterative scheme. After analysing the different characteristics of each implementation, we discuss the suitable applications for these schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197684","htmlLink":"/document/6779074/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel iterative threshold for anti-jamming algorithm and its implementation on FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel iterative threshold for anti-jamming algorithm and its implementation on FPGA","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"025F040247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051735S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6779077,"authors":[{"name":"Wonsun Bong","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Seoul, Dongdaemun-gu, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6779077/6779077-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wonsun Bong received BS and MS degree from Chungju University in 2009 and from University of Seoul in 2011, all in electrical engineering.

In this paper, a compressed multi-access scheme is proposed for MIMO-based VCN via compressive sensing (CS) techniques. In particular, a Zero-Forcing (ZF) based random precoding scheme is proposed for vehicles to combine the advantages of MIMO and CS. Correspondingly, an iterative Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm is devised for half-blind reconstruction at central station' side. Based on these two sub-schemes, the active vehicles keep sending the precoded symbols until central station decodes successfully and sends back the feedback reports. Simulation results show that, while maintaining a certain level of mean square error (MSE) performance, the proposed multi-access scheme can save the time resources notably when comparing with traditional multi-access schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compresseci multi-access for MIMO-based Vehicle Communications Network","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779102","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06779102.pdf","startPage":"966","endPage":"970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Compresseci multi-access for MIMO-based Vehicle Communications Network","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779102/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197572","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compresseci multi-access for MIMO-based Vehicle Communications Network","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"026F020341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056492S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6779103,"authors":[{"name":"Harshal Nigam","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Rajasthan Technical University, Kota Rajasthan, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6779103/6779103-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Harshal Nigam (B.E 2011) received the B.E degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from College of Technology and Engineering, Maharana Pratap University of Agriculture and Technology, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India in 2011.

It is a popular method for high data rate wireless communications. MIMO techniques promise a significant boost in the performance of OFDM systems. In this paper, a novel design UWB MIMO OFDM system using a compact double-sided printed antenna having ultra-wideband and band-notched characteristic is proposed. The UWB antennas are designed on CST Microwave studio simulation software with return loss less than -10dB, and further using the results from CST, OFDM transmission and reception on a MIMO system is done on MATLAB software. The MIMO UWB antennas are designed using polarization diversity of the individual antennas. The performance of this system is studied using BPSK modulation and finally bit error rate and operating range is obtained. The transmitting bandwidth is UWB (i.e. 3.1-10.6GHz) and the receiving bandwidth is notch UWB (notch bandwidth 5-5.9GHz) are chosen to reduce the interference at the receiver side. Furthermore, a MIMO UWB system is designed at a frequency of 9.4GHz that is used for micro power radar application in the ultra wideband removing the interference from WLAN band.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779103","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06779103.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","startPage":"971","endPage":"977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and performance analysis of UWB MIMO OFDM system using microstrip antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance analysis of UWB MIMO OFDM system using microstrip antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779103/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197685","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779103/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance analysis of UWB MIMO OFDM system using microstrip antennas","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"026F030441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039598S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6779115,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Tan","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, P.R.

The selection process among groups of users in different service areas is formulated as a dynamic evolutionary game. In order to achieve an equilibrium, we present the Q-learning algorithm that can help distributed individual users adapt the situation and make cell selection decisions independently. With their own knowledge of the past, the users can learn to achieve the equilibrium without a centralized controller to gather other users information.

Through the superposition of an additional training vector at the relay under certain power allocation scheme, the separated channel information can be obtained directly at the destination. The Bayesian CRLB is derived for the random channel parameters, and orthogonal training vectors from the two source nodes are required to keep the Bayesian CRLB practical, due to the self-interference in the TWRN. A set of training vectors obtained from the minimization of the Bayesian CRLB are applied in a specific suboptimal channel estimation algorithm, and the mean-square error (MSE) performance is provided to verify the Bayesian CRLB results.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1054","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06779119.pdf","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Superimposed training and channel estimation for two-way relay networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Channel estimation","Relays","Bayes methods","OFDM","Vectors","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","Bayes methods","channel estimation","estimation theory","fading channels","mean square error methods","minimisation","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superimposed training","channel estimation","OFDM modulation","amplify-and-forward network","two-way relay network","TWRN","Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound","CRLB","block-fading channels","frequency-selective channels","power allocation","random channel parameters","orthogonal training vectors","self-interference","minimization","mean-square error","MSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relay","channel estimation","Bayesian Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound(CRLB)","training design","mean-square error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Superimposed training and channel estimation for two-way relay networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779119/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779119/","accessionNumber":"14197596","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superimposed training and channel estimation for two-way relay networks","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"026P150348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053602S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6779120,"authors":[{"name":"Chengmei Li","affiliation":["Institution of Advanced Communications, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6779120/6779120-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chengmei Li received her bachelor degree in electrical engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, P.R.

One of the major challenges for femtocell network is the access control. The hybrid access control mechanism, as a tradeoff between open and closed scenario, is the most promising access mechanism from which both users and operators benefit. Femtocell user equipments (FUEs) select femtocell access points (FAPs) according to their reported channel information which FAPs confidently own, and selfish FAPs have incentive to report larger information to win greater opportunity to be selected. Considering the aforementioned truth-telling in access control issue, this paper proposes access control scheme for hybrid femtocell network based on Arrow-d'Aspremont-Gerard-Varet (AGV) mechanism. Close form for the payment is given. Moreover, the access control scheme is nearly optimal performances with low computational complexity compared with the optimal access scheme. Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate that the access control scheme can be apply to hybrid femtocell network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Access control for hybrid femtocell network based on AGV mechanism","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779120","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06779120.pdf","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Access control for hybrid femtocell network based on AGV mechanism","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779120/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197740","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Access control for hybrid femtocell network based on AGV mechanism","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"026P160351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059289S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6779125,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Hence, incorporating this technique with passive optical network (PON) will enable the system to support higher bandwidth compared to the standard PON. The decoder is configured based on spectral coding because of its good noise suppression properties. Since the most important aspect of PON architecture is its simplicity, a multi PON access network each PON comprises 9 users encoded by modified quadratic congruence (MQC) codes at the C band for downstream signals with channel spacing 25/50 GHz is simulated. In this article low error rate transmission at high data rate for distances up to 28 km is demonstrated. Variation in the results was studied when varied fiber length, data rate and different effective power were applied. It has been shown that OCDMA is capable of providing gigabit-per-second for each user. The receiver sensitivity is affected by the multi premises system, where the best system performance can only be achieved when the effective power is -1dBm. Nevertheless, the results have indicated that the proposed PON based on spectral amplitude coding OCDMA technique is capable to support multi premises network.","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06779125.pdf","startPage":"1080","endPage":"1083","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi premises network based on spectral amplitude coding optical CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Passive optical networks","Optical network units","Optical fibers","Optical fiber sensors","Adaptive optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","code division multiple access","decoding","next generation networks","optical receivers","passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipremise network","spectral amplitude coding optical CDMA system","OCDMA technique","multidownstream passive optical network","optical code division multiple access technique","next-generation optical access network","noise suppression property","multiPON access network","modified quadratic congruence code","MQC code","error rate transmission","receiver sensitivity","decoder","frequency 25 GHz","frequency 50 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modified quadratic congruence (MQC) codes","Optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) system","passive optical network (PON)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multi premises network based on spectral amplitude coding optical CDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779125/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197587","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi premises network based on spectral amplitude coding optical CDMA systems","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"027A010015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066311S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6779126,"authors":[{"name":"Amira M.

The decoders based on the iterative belief propagation algorithm provide near optimum performance but also have very high computational complexity. Therefore significant research has recently focused on reduced complexity architectures based on the group of so-called bit-flipping algorithms. In the basic bit-flipping algorithm the number of failed parity checks for each bit is computed and the bit with the maximum failed parity checks is inverted. Inverting bits above a certain threshold removes the complexity involved with a maximum-search and, adaptive thresholds on each bit can further reduce the computation overhead. The criterion for the threshold update affects the error and convergence performances. Here, we describe a low-complexity architecture that has two (or more) decoder branches each with a different threshold scaling factor and select the threshold and bits at each iteration from the branch with the lowest syndrome sum. We then investigate the effect of adding a random Uniform or Gaussian noise perturbation to the threshold in order to reduce the average iteration count further in order to provide the opportunity to escape from stuck decoding states.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779175","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06779175.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance investigation of reduced complexity bit-flipping using variable thresholds and noise perturbation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779175/","displayDocTitle":"Performance investigation of reduced complexity bit-flipping using variable thresholds and noise perturbation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197770","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779175/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance investigation of reduced complexity bit-flipping using variable thresholds and noise perturbation","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0401J010033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065026S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6779185,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Minh Tran","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering and Science, Okinawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6767438/6778899/6779185/6779185-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hai Minh Tran was born in Hanam, Vietnam, on June 09, 1988.

So ICI canceller is an important task for designers of mobile OFDM receivers. The works of Fischer et al. (2003) and Mostofi and Cox (2005) proposed an efficient method to reduce ICI. The main idea of this method is to linearly approximate time varying channel within one OFDM symbol. Then a large ICI matrix equation is given. However the estimated values of the channel transfer function - the diagonal of the ICI matrix is corrupted by ICL Consequently, the equalized signal still is distorted. In this paper, we propose an iterative method to improve performance of the conventional method. We implement Jacobi iteration method to solve the big ICI matrix equation. Thereby, we are able to implement ICI canceller by a simple FIR filter rather than finding the inverse of ICI matrix. Next, at second iteration of Jacobi method, we improve the accuracy the diagonal by removing ICI from pilot symbols and re-estimating the channel transfer function. Simulation results for ISDB-T mode 3 demonstrated that our method could double performance of the conventional method under TU-6 channel and Doppler Spread. The improvement is better for two paths and one path Doppler channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767438/6778899/06779185.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"297","publicationTitle":"16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2014.6779185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6778899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On ICI canceller for mobile OFDM DTV receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Equations","Finite impulse response filters","Mathematical model","OFDM","Transfer functions","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital television","Doppler effect","FIR filters","intercarrier interference","iterative methods","Jacobian matrices","mobile television","OFDM modulation","television receivers","transfer function matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ICI canceller","mobile OFDM DTV receivers","OFDM mobile receiver","intercarrier interference","Doppler spread","ICI matrix equation","equalized signal","iterative method","Jacobi iteration method","FIR filter","pilot symbol","channel transfer function reestimation","ISDB-T mode 3","TU-6 channel","Doppler channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital television (DTV)","Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI)","Jacobi Iteration","Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"On ICI canceller for mobile OFDM DTV receivers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779185/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197728","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On ICI canceller for mobile OFDM DTV receivers","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0403J010543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046015S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6779190,"authors":[{"name":"Fathy M.

It has been shown that the bandwidth of the amplifier can be further increased and gain spectrum can be tailored by using pumping with multiple wavelengths. In this paper, the distributed multi-pumping Raman amplifier has been studied and analyzed by testing two designed model of amplifier to obtain the gain of maximum flatness and bandwidth. Also we have investigated the effects of many parameters on the gain and bandwidth of Raman amplifier such as: pumping wavelength, offset wavelength, the relative refractive index difference and the number and location of the cascaded units used in the amplifier model design. The models is analyzed where six and eight Raman pumping of special pumping power and pumping wavelengths are lunched in the forward direction where each model is analyzed by two different way. The gain is computed over the spectral optical wavelengths (1.45\u03bcm \u2264 \u03bb signal \u2264 1.65\u03bcm).

Recently standardized IEEE 802.22 set of cognitive radio protocols envisages fixed and nomadic receivers at below 800 MHz bands. Radio link design for this cognitive radio consider that the channels are available only dynamically to secondary users. Scanning period is thus embedded in link layer control as overhead and reduces overall efficiency of cognitive radio technology. For mobile receivers, availability of permanent channels for radio link control is essential for in-band signaling. Existing mobile communication system uses CDMA 800, GSM 900, GSM 1800 and WCDMA 2000 MHz bands for which approximately l/8\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n of the band capacity is used for in-band signaling. Present work provides an assessment of vacant channels in mobile communications range which were permanently available at the time of measurement. The study used conventional Radio frequency scanners available for different bands and dedicated engineering handsets for tracking active frequencies. The tests were performed with assemblies carried in a vehicle and across the length and breadth of each city. The allotment of frequencies by Frequency Regulatory Authority to local mobile operators along with the frequency bands reserved for further distribution were also considered. The experimentally collected data were analyzed using RF analysis software and spread sheet database. An analysis of the collected data lead to arrive at the conclusion that more than l/8\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n part of resources of each band are nearly permanently vacant which is enough to design in-band common control signalling methods for cognitive radio. Also, with the help of collected data of eight cities, an empirical relationship has been established which can be taken as a thumb rule for projection of channel occupancy from densely populated core areas of big cities to less populated township areas when population is known.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14197704","htmlLink":"/document/6779197/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An empirical assessment of Quasi-permanently vacant channels in mobile communication bands for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical assessment of Quasi-permanently vacant channels in mobile communication bands for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Pyeongchang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0405J030558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07988S","chronDate":"16-19 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767438","isNumber":"6778899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767438","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6778899","articleId":"6779197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GIRI)","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6779207,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The two parameter difference pattern, developed here for the circular aperature antenna, is designed to have nearly equal sidelobes similar to those of the Taylor sum pattern. The difference pattern is asymptotic to a model difference pattern which has the greatest slope (angle sensitivity) for a given sidelobe level. The model function is unrealizable because it has uniform sidelobes which are infinite in extent. The two parameter difference pattern is realizable and is expressed in a Fourier \u2014 Bessel series of N terms in a manner similar to Taylor's treatment of the sum pattern. The other parameter, A, controls sidelobe level. Comprehensive tables of the Fourier \u2014 Bessel coefficients are given for both the circular aperture series and the difference pattern series. Directivity and angle sensitivity are investigated and found to have maximum values that decrease as sidelobe level decreases. The monopulse system performance using the asymptotic difference pattern and the Taylor sum pattern compares favorably with a maximum likelihood angle estimation system. Development of a line source difference pattern is presented in the appendix.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of monopulse antenna difference patterns with low sidelobes","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1968.tb00056.x","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6779205/06779207.pdf","startPage":"623","endPage":"650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1968.tb00056.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779205","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1968","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1968","displayDocTitle":"Design of monopulse antenna difference patterns with low sidelobes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"May-June 1968","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of monopulse antenna difference patterns with low sidelobes","sourcePdf":"bstj4705623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044202S","chronDate":"May-June  1968","isNumber":"6779205","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"72","articleId":"6779207","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6779208,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Amplitude and phase distributions and spatial correlations of fields and signals are deduced, and a simple direct relationship is established between the signal amplitude spectrum and the product of the incident plane waves' angular distribution and the azimuthal antenna gain. The coherence of two mobile-radio signals of different frequencies is shown to depend on the statistical distribution of the relative time delays in the arrival of the component waves, and the coherent bandwidth is shown to be the inverse of the spread in time delays.

The challenge is to design a system that yields substantial throughput gain while causing only minimal perturbations to the existing standard. We are proposing a system that evolves features already present in the CDMA2000 Release B and IS-856 (1xEV-DO) standards and reuses concepts and capabilities that have been introduced for high-speed packet data support on the forward link (FL) in Release C of the CDMA2000 standard. The RL of Release C of the CDMA2000 standard supports a relatively slow scheduled operation of this link using signaling messages. Scheduling with shorter latencies can be achieved by moving this functionality to the physical layer. Concurrently, both the FL and RL channel conditions may be tracked, and users may be scheduled based on this knowledge. To further manage the power and bandwidth cost on the FL, that is, of scheduling users' transmissions on the RL, the mobile station (MS) is permitted to operate in either a scheduled mode or an autonomous mode. A capability is provided for the MS station to switch the mode of operation. Performance impact of, and gain from, some of the system features is characterized through simulation results.","doi":"10.1002/bltj.10019","publicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"Bell Labs Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731002/6779231/06779236.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.10019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolution of the reverse link of CDMA-based systems to support high-speed data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779236/","displayDocTitle":"Evolution of the reverse link of CDMA-based systems to support high-speed data","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"2003","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution of the reverse link of CDMA-based systems to support high-speed data","sourcePdf":"6779236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028414S","chronDate":"2003","isNumber":"6779231","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731002","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6779236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6779241,"authors":[{"name":"Donald S.

We derive the achievable capacity of MIMO-DRT and find that it can reach the MIMO channel capacity under multi-user cochannel interference. This result is due to the fact that MIMO-DRT decorrelates the interference plus noise over all receive antennas so that the subsequent noise-limited MIMO receiver can maximize the achievable capacity. Simulation results further show that compared to the optimum noise-limited MIMO receiver and other MIMO receivers that also employ the correlations over all receive antennas, MIMO-DRT gives significant gains in the achievable capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decorrelation Based Receive Transformation for MIMO System under Multi-User Co-Channel Interference","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2014.032014.130904","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6839992/06779248.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2014.032014.130904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6839992","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779248/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Decorrelation Based Receive Transformation for MIMO System under Multi-User Co-Channel Interference","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6779248/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14396421","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decorrelation Based Receive Transformation for MIMO System under Multi-User Co-Channel Interference","sourcePdf":"305-wcl1406-teng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127056S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6839992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6839992","articleId":"6779248","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6779249,"authors":[{"name":"Indrakshi Dey","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Indrakshi","lastName":"Dey","id":"37718462100"},{"name":"Geoffrey G.

Detection of failure and performing defect free routing is a new paradigm. This paper proposes a heuristic approach of droplet routing by evading the defective electrode regions. The proposed work tries to minimize multiple usage of same resource, thus by reducing the probability of defects, or routing failure due to residual traces of several droplets. All the droplets are routed in concurrent fashion, and repeated utilization of same electrode is avoided by assigning a variable to the electrodes, and updating the value in each iteration. Experimental studies show some notable results compared to some existing literature. It is also noticed that percentage degradation in electrode usage and latest arrival time due to defect aware routing is quite less and under a tolerable limit considering the importance of defect bypassing approach.","doi":"10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779290","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767436/6779283/06779290.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defect aware droplet routing technique in digital microfluidic biochip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779290/","displayDocTitle":"Defect aware droplet routing technique in digital microfluidic biochip","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197355","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779290/","conferenceDate":"21-22 Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defect aware droplet routing technique in digital microfluidic biochip","confLoc":"Gurgaon, India","sourcePdf":"RP006AA29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085054S","chronDate":"21-22 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767436","isNumber":"6779283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767436","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6779283","articleId":"6779290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6779302,"authors":[{"name":"Joyashree Bag","affiliation":["Dept. of ETCE, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Joyashree","lastName":"Bag","id":"38233326100"},{"name":"Subhashis Roy","affiliation":["Dept. of ETCE, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Subhashis","lastName":"Roy","id":"37084889700"},{"name":"Subir Kumar Sarkar","affiliation":["Dept. of ETCE, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Subir Kumar","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37085403298"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2572-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2571-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6779302","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":476},"abstract":"In a large Wireless Sensor Network, power efficiency of sensor node is one of the most important factor.

For each new user or application to be a part of communication network the preliminary requirement is the allocation of frequency spectrum band. This frequency band is a limited resource and it is impossible to expand its boundaries. So the need is to employ intelligent, adaptive and reconfigurable communication systems which can investigate the requirements of the end user and assign the requisite resources in contrast to the traditional communication systems which allocate a fixed amount of resource to the user under adaptive, autonomic and opportunistic cognitive radio environment. Cognitive Radio(CR) Technology has emerged from software defined radios wherein the key parameters of interest are frequency, power and modulation technique adopted. The role of Cognitive Radio is to alter these parameters under ubiquitous situations. The Spectrum Sensing is an important task to determine the availability of the vacant channels to be utilised by the secondary users without posing any harmful interference to the primary users.

Any user can use these resources through internet on the basis of Pay-As-Per-Use system. A service used by any user can produce a very large amount of data. So in this case, the data transfer cost between two dependent resources will be very high. In addition, a complex application can have a large number of tasks which may cause an increase in total cost of execution of that application, if not scheduled in an optimized way. So to overcome these problems, the authors present a Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) - based heuristic scheduling algorithm to schedule the tasks of an application onto available resources. The CSO heuristic algorithm considers both data transmission cost between two dependent resources and execution cost of tasks on different resources. The authors experiment with the proposed CSO algorithm using a hypothetical workflow and compare the workflow scheduling results with the existing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.

SVD and DWT methods are used for watermark embedding because DWT method is more flexible and provides a wide range of functionalities for still image processing. Further a significant image attacks are carried out on the watermarked image and the watermark is extracted by the help of proposed watermark extraction algorithm based on Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN).In the current era of online business such type of technique can play a significant role to identify the copyright of the product even there are numerous image attacks on the watermarked image. It can lead to save the owner of the product from a heavy loss and restrict the further theft of the products. The proposed watermark embedding and extracting algorithms are tested on MATLAB 8.2 with various parameters such as PSNR and MSE. The result shows that after a numerous image attacks like paper and salts, mean, median, shear, noise, crop and rotation the watermark is identifiable.","doi":"10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779457","startPage":"985","endPage":"990","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6767436/6779283/06779457.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient hybrid watermarking approach by using SVD, DWT, and Back Propagation Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Discrete wavelet transforms","PSNR","Neurons","Biological neural networks","Matrix decomposition","Filter banks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","copyright","discrete wavelet transforms","image watermarking","least mean squares methods","neural nets","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SVD","DWT","backpropagation neural network","watermark embedding technique","watermark extraction algorithm","still image processing","image attack","BPNN","copyright","MATLAB 8.2","PSNR","MSE","paper and salt","mean","median","shear","noise","crop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DWT","SVD","DWT-SVD Hybrid watermarking","Bipolar Neural Network","Image Attacks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Efficient hybrid watermarking approach by using SVD, DWT, and Back Propagation Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779457/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"21-22 Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197495","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient hybrid watermarking approach by using SVD, DWT, and Back Propagation Neural Network","confLoc":"Gurgaon, India","sourcePdf":"RP173IMP70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090144S","chronDate":"21-22 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767436","isNumber":"6779283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767436","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6779283","articleId":"6779457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6779461,"authors":[{"name":"Sakshi Midha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Banasthali Vidyapith, India"],"firstName":"Sakshi","lastName":"Midha","id":"37086750754"},{"name":"Ritu Vijay","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Banasthali Vidyapith, India"],"firstName":"Ritu","lastName":"Vijay"},{"name":"Sarita Kumari","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Rajasthan, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Sarita","lastName":"Kumari","id":"37086748894"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2572-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2571-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6779461","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Conferences","Handheld computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","image colour analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RGB analysis","YCbCr color spaces","wavelet transform","color image compression","Biortho wavelet filter","standard images","quality estimation parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["color Image compression","color model","DWT","PSNR","energy retained","entropy","RGB","YCbCr"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new algorithm for compression of color images using RGB and Y CBCR color space models.

The proposed approach performs the summarization task by unsupervised learning methodology. The importance of a sentence in an input text is evaluated by the help of Simplified Lesk algorithm. As an online semantic dictionary WordNet is used. First, this approach evaluates the weights of all the sentences of a text separately using the Simplified Lesk algorithm and arranges them in decreasing order according to their weights. Next, according to the given percentage of summarization, a particular number of sentences are selected from that ordered list. The proposed approach gives best results upto 50% summarization of the original text and gives satisfactory result even upto 25% summarization of the original text.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Feb. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14197436","htmlLink":"/document/6779492/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2014","conferenceDate":"21-22 Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An approach to automatic text summarization using WordNet","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to automatic text summarization using WordNet","confLoc":"Gurgaon, India","sourcePdf":"RP208SC12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066066S","chronDate":"21-22 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6767436","isNumber":"6779283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6767436","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6779283","articleId":"6779492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6779500,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Initially, we generate an initial population that has number of members and the members have the weight values which are used to train the neural network. To identify a perfect member to train the neural network, we use the hybrid algorithm operations. We give each member to the neural network and we find the fitness for each member and we categorize the members to perform the hybrid operations i.e. which member has to do which operation. After performing corresponding operations on the categorized members, we get a new set of members and we iterate the process until we get a stable member for producer operation.

The main contribution is the extension of particle swarm optimization (PSO) from the continuous domain to the binary or discrete domain. First, a novel bi-velocity strategy is developed to represent the possibilities of each dimension being 1 and 0. This strategy is suitable to describe the binary characteristic of the MRP, where 1 stands for a node being selected to construct the multicast tree, whereas 0 stands for being otherwise. Second, BVDPSO updates the velocity and position according to the learning mechanism of the original PSO in the continuous domain. This maintains the fast convergence speed and global search ability of the original PSO. Experiments are comprehensively conducted on all of the 58 instances with small, medium, and large scales in the Operation Research Library (OR-library). The results confirm that BVDPSO can obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions rapidly since it only needs to generate a few multicast trees. BVDPSO outperforms not only several state-of-the-art and recent heuristic algorithms for the MRP problems, but also algorithms based on genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and PSO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779598/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","volume":"61","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581789","htmlLink":"/document/6779598/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Bi-Velocity Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization and Its Application to Multicast Routing Problem in Communication Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Technology Research and Development Program (\u00bf863\u00bf Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013AA01A212"},{"fundingName":"Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61332002"},{"fundingName":"National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61125205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Bi-Velocity Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization and Its Application to Multicast Routing Problem in Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2314075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12399S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6898054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6898054","articleId":"6779598","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6779600,"authors":[{"name":"Rusdha Muharar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Syiah Kuala University, Banda Aceh, Indonesia"],"bio":{"p":["Rusdha Muharar obtained the Sarjana Teknik (Bachelor of Engineering) degree in electrical engineering from Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia, in 1999.

Assuming the users learn their direct and interfering channels perfectly, they can feed back this information to the base stations (BSs) over the uplink channels. The BSs then use the channel information to design their transmission scheme. Two types of feedback are considered: 1) analog and 2) digital. In the analog feedback case, the users send their unquantized and uncoded channel state information (CSI) over the uplink channels. In this context, given a user's fixed transmit power, we investigate how he/she should optimally allocate it to feed back the direct and interfering (or cross) CSI for two types of BS cooperation schemes, namely, multicell processing (MCP) and coordinated beamforming. In the digital feedback case, the direct and cross link channel vectors of each user are quantized separately, each using the random vector quantization scheme, with different size codebooks. The users then send the index of the quantization vector in the corresponding codebook to the BSs. Similar to the feedback optimization problem for the analog feedback, we investigate the optimal bit partitioning for the direct and interfering link for both types of cooperation. We focus on regularized channel inversion precoding structures and perform our analysis in the large system limit in which the number of users per cell (K) and the number of antennas per BS (N) tend to infinity with their ratio \u03b2 = (K/N) held fixed. We show that for both types of cooperation, for some values of interfering channel gain, usually at low values, no cooperation between the BSs is preferred. This is because, for these values of cross channel gain, the channel estimates for the cross link are not accurate enough for their knowledge to contribute to improving the SINR and there is no benefit in doing BS cooperation under that condition. We also show that for the MCP scheme, unlike in the perfect CSI case, the SINR improves only when the interfering channel gain is above a certain threshold.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779600/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","volume":"60","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"14301836","publicationDate":"June 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779600/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Base Station Cooperation With Feedback Optimization: A Large System Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base Station Cooperation With Feedback Optimization: A Large System Analysis","sourcePdf":"tit-muharar-2314092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135627S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6816018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6816018","articleId":"6779600","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6779604,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Hermans","affiliation":["KU Leuven ESAT/COSIC & iMinds, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6939756/6779604/herma-small.gif","p":["Jens Hermans","received the master\u2019s degree in mathematical engineering and the PhD degree in engineering sciences at KU\n Leuven in 2008 and 2012, respectively.

The behaviors of the two memristor models are investigated when they are excited by a sinusoidal voltage source. Both models satisfy the general features of memristive systems such as having a zero-crossing property in the form of an i-v Lissajous figure. In order to explore the unique characteristics and applications of the memristor in microwave devices, first we incorporate the memristor in a microstrip transmission line as a load. We do the analysis using a finite-difference time-domain simulator integrated with a nonlinear SPICE circuit solver. Furthermore, we design a reconfigurable microstrip bandpass filter based on a memristor-loaded resonator, and utilize a memristor as a carrier-wave modulator connecting the microstrip patch antenna to the ground.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779611/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14281941","volume":"13","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Two Memristor SPICE Models and Their Applications in Microwave Devices","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two Memristor SPICE Models and Their Applications in Microwave Devices","sourcePdf":"tnano-liu-2314126-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079075S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6810833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6810833","articleId":"6779611","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6779615,"authors":[{"name":"Geok Teng Ong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6873368/6779615/ong-2308992-small.gif","p":["Geok Teng Ong was born in Malaysia.

The design incorporates a proposed current source replica (CSR) circuit that facilitates the pair matching layout for all critical pairs in DDA input stage. This is in contrast with the conventional design where the stated layout technique can only be applied to the input transistor pairs. Besides, a new analysis on common-mode signals and differential common-mode signal in chopper-stabilized DDA is given. It has shown that the differential common-mode signal is not modulated in chopping DDA. The relationship between dc offset and differential common-mode rejection ratio (CMRRd) is illustrated. Enhancing CMRRd will lead to reduction of dc offset and offset drift in DDA. Fabricated by a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process, the experimental results have shown that the maximum input-referred offset for the injection-nulling switch chopper DDA with CSR circuit is 3 \u03bcV, while the input-referred dc offset is 1.78 \u03bcV (mean + standard deviation) at a chopping frequency of 10 kHz from eight fabricated samples. For a closed-loop gain of 40.17 dB, its output ripple is reduced by three times with respect to itself without CSR. The IA powered with a high-power supply rejection regulator has been tested with a resistive Wheatstone bridge. The transducer achieves an input-referred noise of 3.76 \u03bcVrms for 2-kHz bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2014.2308992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2014.2308992","startPage":"2253","endPage":"2263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6873368/06779615.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6873368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Power-Aware Chopper-Stabilized Instrumentation Amplifier for Resistive Wheatstone Bridge Sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Power-Aware Chopper-Stabilized Instrumentation Amplifier for Resistive Wheatstone Bridge Sensors","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2014","volume":"63","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779615/","accessionNumber":"14513289","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779615/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MediaTek, Singapore"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Power-Aware Chopper-Stabilized Instrumentation Amplifier for Resistive Wheatstone Bridge Sensors","sourcePdf":"tim-ong-2308992-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088508S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6873368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6873368","articleId":"6779615","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6779620,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6898054/6779620/chen-2314070-small.gif","p":["\nQian Chen received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from\nJiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in control\nengineering.","His research interests include permanent-magnet machine design, fault-tolerance analysis, and electric machine driver\ndesign."]},"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Chen","id":"38237873900"},{"name":"Guohai Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6898054/6779620/gliu-2314070-small.gif","p":["\nGuohai Liu (M'07) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering\nfrom Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China, in 1985, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in control engineering from\nSoutheast University, Nanjing, China, in 1988 and 2002, respectively.","Since 1988, he has been with Jiangsu University, where he is currently a Professor and the Dean of the School of\nElectrical Information Engineering.

To reverse-engineer the brain in this way, a method is needed that shows how large numbers of simple components, each of which receives thousands of inputs from other components, can be organized to perform the desired computations. We achieve this through the neural engineering framework (NEF), a mathematical theory that provides methods for systematically generating biologically plausible spiking networks to implement nonlinear and linear dynamical systems. On top of this, we propose the semantic pointer architecture (SPA), a hypothesis regarding some aspects of the organization, function, and representational resources used in the mammalian brain. We conclude by discussing Spaun, which is an example model that uses the SPA and is implemented using the NEF. Throughout, we discuss the software tool Neural ENGineering Objects (Nengo), which allows for the synthesis and simulation of neural models efficiently on the scale of Spaun, and provides support for constructing models using the NEF and the SPA. The resulting NEF/SPA/Nengo combination is a general tool set for both evaluating hypotheses about how the brain works, and for building systems that compute particular functions using neuron-like components.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306061","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/6807530/06779629.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"898","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2014.2306061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6807530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale Synthesis of Functional Spiking Neural Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale Synthesis of Functional Spiking Neural Circuits","volume":"102","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14267033","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779629/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale Synthesis of Functional Spiking Neural Circuits","sourcePdf":"jproc-eliasmith-2306061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116108S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"6807530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6807530","articleId":"6779629","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6779640,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","Shanghai Key Lab for Trustworthy Computing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7106033/6779640/zhou-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhou","is currently working toward the PhD degree in computer science with Trusted Digital Technology (TDT) Laboratory,\n Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.

However, it brings about the challenge of keeping both the data confidentiality and patients' identity privacy simultaneously. Many existing access control and anonymous authentication schemes cannot be straightforwardly exploited. To solve the problem, in this paper, a novel authorized accessible privacy model (AAPM) is established. Patients can authorize physicians by setting an access tree supporting flexible threshold predicates. Then, based on it, by devising a new technique of attribute-based designated verifier signature, a patient self-controllable multi-level privacy-preserving cooperative authentication scheme (PSMPA) realizing three levels of security and privacy requirement in distributed m-healthcare cloud computing system is proposed. The directly authorized physicians, the indirectly authorized physicians and the unauthorized persons in medical consultation can respectively decipher the personal health information and/or verify patients' identities by satisfying the access tree with their own attribute sets. Finally, the formal security proof and simulation results illustrate our scheme can resist various kinds of attacks and far outperforms the previous ones in terms of computational, communication and storage overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2314119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2314119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7106033/06779640.pdf","startPage":"1693","endPage":"1703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7106033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779640/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"PSMPA: Patient Self-Controllable and Multi-Level Privacy-Preserving Cooperative Authentication in Distributedm-Healthcare Cloud Computing System","volume":"26","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15125646","htmlLink":"/document/6779640/","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2019","publicationDate":"1 June 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Program on Key Basic Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2012CB723401, 61161140320, 61033014, 61373154 and 61371083"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSMPA: Patient Self-Controllable and Multi-Level Privacy-Preserving Cooperative Authentication in Distributedm-Healthcare Cloud Computing System","sourcePdf":"tpds-cao-2314119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101955S","chronDate":"June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7106033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7106033","articleId":"6779640","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6779643,"authors":[{"name":"Diane Titz","affiliation":["EpOC, Universit\u00e9 Nice Sophia Antipolis, Sophia Antipolis, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6810855/6779643/titz-2311092-small.gif","p":["Diane Titz (S'11\u2013M'12) received the M.S.

First, the integrated passive device (IPD) technology from STMicroelectronics is investigated in the mm-wave range through the simulation, fabrication, and measurements of a microstrip line and a simple hybrid coupler. Then, a novel coupler topology with emphasis on miniaturization and broadband operation is theorized. Analytical equations are derived and a 60-GHz coupler is optimized on IPD technology. Measurement results are discussed and compared with state-of-the art publications. The whole 57-66-GHz bandwidth is efficiently covered with the three following performance: -10-dB impedance matching, \u00b11-dB amplitude imbalance, and \u00b15\u00b0 phase imbalance. As an application example, the novel coupler is integrated into a 4 \u00d7 4 Butler matrix suitable for an array-antenna demonstrating stateof-the art performance in terms of insertion loss and phase error. The measurement of different samples shows low variation of the IPD process because of very good reproducibility making it a suitable candidate for circuits operating in the 60-GHz band.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2014.2311092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6810855","startPage":"911","endPage":"921","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/6810855/06779643.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Wideband Miniature Branchline Coupler on IPD Technology for Beamforming Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779643/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Wideband Miniature Branchline Coupler on IPD Technology for Beamforming Applications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14281894","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"5","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CIMPACA Design Platform and in part by CREMANT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Wideband Miniature Branchline Coupler on IPD Technology for Beamforming Applications","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-luxey-2311092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121412S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6810855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6810855","articleId":"6779643","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6779644,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/6870503/6779644/6779644-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Li (S\u201911\u2013M\u201913) received the B.E. degree in telecommunications engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2007, the M.S. degree in information science and technology from Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS, USA, in 2012.","Subsequently, he spent 1\u00a0year as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California, Davis, CA, USA.

The efficiency of the trust evaluation process is largely governed by the trust derivation, as it dominates the overhead in the process, and performance of WSNs is particularly sensitive to overhead due to the limited bandwidth and power. This paper proposes an energy-aware trust derivation scheme using game theoretic approach, which manages overhead while maintaining adequate security of WSNs. A risk strategy model is first presented to stimulate WSN nodes' cooperation. Then, a game theoretic approach is applied to the trust derivation process to reduce the overhead of the process. We show with the help of simulations that our trust derivation scheme can achieve both intended security and high efficiency suitable for WSN-based IoT networks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Security","Energy efficiency","Games","Computational modeling","Energy consumption","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Internet of Things","risk analysis","routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy aware trust derivation scheme","game theoretic approach","wireless sensor networks","IoT applications","Internet of Things","risk strategy model"]},{"kwd":["Energy awareness","game theory","Internet of Things (IoT)","security","trust evaluation","wireless sensor network (WSN)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2014.2314132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/6810798/06779650.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6810798","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2014.2314132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Aware Trust Derivation Scheme With Game Theoretic Approach in Wireless Sensor Networks for IoT Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Aware Trust Derivation Scheme With Game Theoretic Approach in Wireless Sensor Networks for IoT Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779650/","volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779650/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14282876","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61272504 and 61201204"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Nature Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4122057"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20130009110010"},{"fundingName":"National S&T Major Program","grantNumber":"2012ZX03005003"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2012YJS016, 2014JBM006 and 2012JBM011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"Taiwan National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC102-2221-E-006-008-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Aware Trust Derivation Scheme With Game Theoretic Approach in Wireless Sensor Networks for IoT Applications","sourcePdf":"jiot-chen-2314132-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126563S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"6810798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6810798","articleId":"6779650","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":6779655,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanmao Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6898054/6779655/ye-2314052-small.gif","p":["\nYuanmao Ye received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the\nUniversity of Jinan, Jinan, China, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in control theory and control engineering from the\nSouth China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2010.

This structure is not only very simple and easy to be extended to a higher level, but also its gate driver circuits are simplified because the number of active switches is reduced.

To achieve independent pressure regulation for each chamber of the cylinder, as well as energy recovery during the back-and-forth movement of the cylinder, a hardware configuration with five low-cost programmable cartridge valves and an accumulator is developed to control the motion of the cylinder. Based on the hardware configuration, a novel multilevel control algorithm is proposed, which consists of the desired motion and pressure tracking control level (level I), the flow distribution level (level II), and the offside pressure profile planning level (level III). The proposed approach is theoretically shown to be able to minimize the energy consumption of the system while maintaining good motion tracking performance. Experimental studies confirm that the proposed strategy can indeed achieve both accurate motion tracking and minimum energy consumption simultaneously. Compared with the previous four-valve scheme and five-valve flow regeneration scheme without the use of accumulator by Liu and Yao, the proposed strategy has much less total energy consumption and equally good tracking performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2314054","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6898054/06779658.pdf","startPage":"7046","endPage":"7054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2314054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6898054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Saving Adaptive Robust Control of a Hydraulic Manipulator Using Five Cartridge Valves With an Accumulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779658/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Saving Adaptive Robust Control of a Hydraulic Manipulator Using Five Cartridge Valves With an Accumulator","volume":"61","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581768","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779658/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB035400"},{"fundingName":"Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51221004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Saving Adaptive Robust Control of a Hydraulic Manipulator Using Five Cartridge Valves With an Accumulator","sourcePdf":"tie-lu-2314054-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077004S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6898054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6898054","articleId":"6779658","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6779661,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, NV"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37085412742"},{"name":"Sergio Salinas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Salinas","id":"38468665800"},{"name":"Pan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Li","id":"37402666600"},{"name":"Xiaoxia Huang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxia","lastName":"Huang","id":"37407396800"},{"name":"Yuguang Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Yuguang","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085369718"},{"name":"Savo Glisic","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Savo","lastName":"Glisic","id":"37269887800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"6779661","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1140},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"39KB","file":"/ielx7/7755/6971280/6779661/graphical_abstract/tmc-gagraphic-2314107.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/7755/6971280/6779661/graphical_abstract/tmc-gagraphic-2314107.jpg"},"abstract":"Due to the emerging various data services, current cellular networks have been experiencing a surge of data traffic and are already overloaded; thus, they are not able to meet the ever exploding traffic demand. In this study, we first introduce a multi-radio multi-channel multi-hop cognitive cellular network (M\n<inline-formula><tex-math>$^3$</tex-math> </inline-formula>\nC\n<inline-formula> <tex-math>$^2$</tex-math> </inline-formula>\nN) architecture to enhance network throughput. Under the proposed architecture, we then investigate the minimum length scheduling problem by exploring joint frequency allocation, link scheduling, and routing. In particular, we first formulate a maximal independent set based joint scheduling and routing optimization problem called original optimization problem (OOP). It is a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) and generally NP-hard problem. Then, employing a column generation based approach, we develop an \n<inline-formula><tex-math>$\\epsilon$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n-bounded approximation algorithm which can obtain an \n<inline-formula><tex-math>$\\epsilon$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-bounded approximate result of OOP. Noticeably, in fact we do not need to find the maximal independent sets in the proposed algorithm, which are usually assumed to be given in previous works although finding all of them is NP-complete. We also revisit the minimum length scheduling problem by considering uncertain channel availability. Simulation results show that we can efficiently find the \n<inline-formula><tex-math>$\\epsilon$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n-bounded approximate results and the optimal result as well, i.e., when \n<inline-formula><tex-math>$\\epsilon =0\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n in the algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6971280/06779661.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2014.2314107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2014.2314107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6971280","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Scheduling for Multi-Radio Multi-Channel Multi-Hop Cognitive Cellular Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Interference","Optimization","Throughput","Routing","Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms"]},{"kwd":["Cognitive cellular networks","multi-radio multi-channel multi-hop","cross-layer optimization","minimum length scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Scheduling for Multi-Radio Multi-Channel Multi-Hop Cognitive Cellular Networks","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6779661/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1149786, ECCS-1128768/1129062, CNS-1147851/1147813 and CNS-1343220/ CNS-1343356"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2011AA010503"},{"fundingName":"Joint Program of National Science Foundation of China-Guangdong","grantNumber":"U1301256"},{"fundingName":"Finnish Academy","grantNumber":"COCAHANE-257162"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Scheduling for Multi-Radio Multi-Channel Multi-Hop Cognitive Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-huang-2314107-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.21977S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6971280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6971280","articleId":"6779661","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6779662,"authors":[{"name":"Venkata Yaramasu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6898054/6779662/yaram-2314060-small.gif","p":["\nVenkata Yaramasu (S'08\u2013M'14) received the B.Tech. degree in\nelectrical and electronics engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India, in 2005, and\nthe M.E. degree in electrical engineering with specialization in power electronics from the Shri Govindram Seksaria\nInstitute of Technology and Science, Indore, India, in 2008.

The proposed method uses the turbine-generator rotor inertia to store the surplus energy during the grid voltage dips. The power conversion system is realized using a three-phase diode-bridge rectifier, a three-level-boost converter, and a neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter. The wind turbine requirements, such as maximum power point tracking, net dc-bus voltage control, balancing of the dc capacitor voltages, and reactive power generation, are modeled as the reference control variables. The generator- and grid-side cost functions are defined to deal with these control objectives. During each sampling interval, the control goals are achieved based on the minimization of cost functions. The coordination of boost and NPC converters and the exchange of reference control variables during normal and LVRT operation are formulated such that the power converters operate in a safe mode while meeting the grid code requirements.

We developed a novel memristor training scheme that preserves high density of synaptic connections in the crossbar organization.

A single sensing and winner-takes-all circuit is used to adjust strength of synaptic connections implemented by all memristors. We present results of HSPICE simulation of the developed architecture, generated control signals and resulting changes of memristor values. We used crosstalk test and Monte Carlo analysis to demonstrate robustness of the proposed architecture. Tests performed on MNIST character recognition benchmark confirmed functionality of the proposed circuit and training scheme in a practical and demanding application.

Each user multiplexes data onto several independently encoded data streams, which are spatially precoded and conveyed over a fading narrowband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. All users' data streams are decoded successively at the receiving base station using zero-forcing decision feedback equalization (ZF-DFE). We target the joint optimization of a decoding order and linear precoders for all users based on long-term channel information. For a class of general MIMO channel models, including the separable-correlation and double-scattering models, we show that the choice of precoder for a certain user does not affect the performance of the others. This leads to a particularly straightforward characterization of general user utility regions as a polyblock, or a convex polytope if time-sharing is allowed. We formulate the decoding-ordering problem under transmit-correlated Rayleigh fading as a linear assignment problem, enabling the use of existing efficient algorithms. Combining decoding ordering with single-user precoder optimization by means of alternating optimization, we propose an efficient iterative scheme that is verified numerically to converge fast and perform close to optimally, successfully reaping the benefits of both precoding and ordering in the MIMO uplink.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2314067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6803925/06779678.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2314067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803925","startPage":"2730","endPage":"2745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Framework for Optimization in the Multi-User MIMO Uplink With ZF-DFE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Framework for Optimization in the Multi-User MIMO Uplink With ZF-DFE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779678/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"10","publicationDate":"May15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14252195","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779678/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Framework for Optimization in the Multi-User MIMO Uplink With ZF-DFE","sourcePdf":"tsp-jarmyr-2314067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143616S","chronDate":"May15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6803925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6803925","articleId":"6779678","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6779679,"authors":[{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications for Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6874603/6779679/peng-2314115-small.gif","p":["\nMugen Peng (M'05\u2013SM'11) received the B.E. degree in electronics\nengineering from Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications (NJUPT), Nanjing, China, in 2000 and the Ph.D.\ndegree in radio resource management from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China\nin 2005.

Nevertheless, the D2D underlaid cellular network is challenging due to the presence of inter-tier and intra-tier interferences. With necessarily lower antenna heights in D2D communication links, the fading channels are likely to contain strong line-of-sight components, which are different from the Rayleigh fading distribution in conventional two-tier heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we derive the success probability, spatial average rate, and area spectral efficiency performances for both cellular users and D2D users by taking into account the different channel propagations that they experience. Specifically, we employ stochastic geometry as an analysis framework to derive closed-form expressions for above performance metrics. Furthermore, to reduce cross-tier interferences and improve system performances, we propose a centralized opportunistic access control scheme as well as a mode selection mechanism. According to the analysis and simulations, we obtain interesting tradeoffs that depend on the effect of the channel propagation parameter, user node density, and the spectrum occupation ratio on the different performance metrics. This work highlights the importance of incorporating the suitable channel propagation model into the system design and analysis to obtain the realistic results and conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2314115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2314115","startPage":"4247","endPage":"4259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6874603/06779679.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6874603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device-to-Device Underlaid Cellular Networks under Rician Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Device-to-Device Underlaid Cellular Networks under Rician Fading Channels","volume":"13","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2014","accessionNumber":"14513478","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779679/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222103 and 61072058"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China 973 Program","grantNumber":"2013CB336600"},{"fundingName":"State Major Science and Technology Special Projects","grantNumber":"2013ZX03001001"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4131003"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund","grantNumber":"20120005140002"},{"fundingName":"SRG ISTD 2012037"},{"fundingName":"SUTD-MIT International Design Centre","grantNumber":"IDSF1200106OH"},{"fundingName":"A STAR SERC","grantNumber":"1224104048"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device-to-Device Underlaid Cellular Networks under Rician Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-peng-2314115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19043S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6874603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6874603","articleId":"6779679","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6779680,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6809863/6779680/6779680-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yunfei Ma (S'12) received the B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China, in 2010, and M.S. degree from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, in 2013, both in electrical engineering, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.","Mr. Ma was the recipient of the 2010 Irwin and Joan Jacobs Scholar Fellowship from Cornell University, the 2010 Best Undergraduate Thesis Award from USTC, and the 2009 National Scholarship from the Ministry of Education, China."]},"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Ma","id":"37957623000"},{"name":"Edwin Chihchuan Kan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6809863/6779680/6779680-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Edwin Chihchuan Kan (S'86\u2013M'91\u2013SM'05) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1984, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA, in 1988 and 1992, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","In January 1992, he joined Dawn Technologies, as a Principal Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Engineer.

Since phase information is now contained within the second harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency, interferences and phase errors caused by direct reflections of the interrogating signal are greatly reduced. By the broadband property of NLTL, a heuristic multi-frequency CW method is formulated to resolve the phase integer ambiguity and to further improve ranging accuracy and robustness even under large phase errors. We present theoretical and simulation analyses, followed by experimental verification.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2014.2311381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6809863/06779680.pdf","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2014.2311381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Indoor Ranging by Broadband Harmonic Generation in Passive NLTL Backscatter Tags","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779680/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Indoor Ranging by Broadband Harmonic Generation in Passive NLTL Backscatter Tags","volume":"62","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267249","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779680/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Indoor Ranging by Broadband Harmonic Generation in Passive NLTL Backscatter Tags","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ma-2311381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078919S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6809863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6809863","articleId":"6779680","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6779684,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Ching Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu"],"bio":{"p":["\nChang-Ching Chen (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical\nengineering, in 2009 and the M.S. degree from the Institute of Communication Engineering, in 2011, all from National\nTsing Hua University, Hsin Chu, Taiwan.","His research interests are in wireless communications and distributed algorithms in networks."]},"firstName":"Chang-Ching","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716586900"},{"name":"Chia-Shiang Tseng","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu"],"bio":{"p":["\nChia-Shiang Tseng received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering,\nin 2010 and the M.S. degree in Institute of Communication Engineering, in 2012, all from National Tsing Hua University,\nHsin Chu, Taiwan.","His research interests are in random search theories and distributed algorithms in wireless networks."]},"firstName":"Chia-Shiang","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37711908700"},{"name":"Juwendo Denis","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6874603/6779684/denis-2314111-small.gif","p":["\nJuwendo Denis (S'12) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical\nengineering, in 2011 and the M.S. degree at the Institute of Communication Engineering, in 2013, all from National Tsing\nHua University, Hsin Chu, Taiwan.","His research interests are distributed algorithms in wireless sensor networks."]},"firstName":"Juwendo","lastName":"Denis","id":"38666372600"},{"name":"Che Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6874603/6779684/lin-2314111-small.gif","p":["\nChe Lin (S'02\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical\nengineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1999, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer\nengineering, in 2003, the M.S. degree in math, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering, in\n2008, all from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.","Since 2008, he has been with National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, where he is currently an Assistant\nProfessor.

It is proved that under two sufficient conditions: 1) the objective function of the random search algorithm is continuous and all its local maxima are global maxima in the considered feasible set, and 2) the origin is an interior point within the support of the probability measure for the random perturbation, the corresponding adaptive distributed beamforming schemes converge almost surely. While the second sufficient condition can be controlled by system designer and satisfied with relative ease, the first sufficient condition initially seems strict. Surprisingly, further analysis on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) functions in AF relay networks with individual and total power constraints demonstrates that, in both scenarios, local maxima are global maxima and hence, the first sufficient condition is satisfied. Finally, the proposed framework was extended to analyze adaptive distributed beamforming schemes in an asynchronous setting, and simulation results were provided to further validate our analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2014","accessionNumber":"14513495","htmlLink":"/document/6779684/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Distributed Beamforming for Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks: Convergence Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC99-2221-E-007-089-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Distributed Beamforming for Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks: Convergence Analysis","sourcePdf":"twc-lin-2314111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099885S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6874603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6874603","articleId":"6779684","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6779686,"authors":[{"name":"Seok-Chul Kwon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6850111/6779686/kwon-2314118-small.gif","p":["\nSeok-Chul Kwon (S'09\u2013M'14) graduated from Seoul Science High\nSchool, National Academy for Gifted Students, Seoul, South Korea in 1996.

The fundamental novelty of the proposed scheme is that it can adjust transmit polarization to yield more desirable per-subcarrier complex cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) observed at the receivers. This is a significant difference between the proposed scheme and conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The capacity analysis of the proposed PDMA scheme is provided, and the feasibility and satisfactory performance of the scheme are demonstrated even when serious time-variant channel depolarization and polarization mismatch between receivers occurs. The proposed cellular down-link PDMA scheme uses synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) with an equally spaced pilot symbol allocation and a channel estimator. Excellent symbol error rate (SER)/effective signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) performance is shown despite the presence of substantial channel depolarization. The scheme can be used to extend the capacity of any cellular system that uses uni-polarized antennas and can be extended and applied to MIMO arrays as well.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2314118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6850111/06779686.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2314118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850111","startPage":"3726","endPage":"3737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization Division Multiple Access on NLoS Wide-Band Wireless Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polarization Division Multiple Access on NLoS Wide-Band Wireless Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779686/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14430089","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779686/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization Division Multiple Access on NLoS Wide-Band Wireless Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-kwon-2314118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089634S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6850111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6850111","articleId":"6779686","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6779687,"authors":[{"name":"Chamith Wijenayake","affiliation":["University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6805240/6779687/6779687-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chamith Wijenayake (S'10) received the B.Sc. degree in electronic and telecommunication engineering with first-class honors from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2007.

We consider energy-and-complexity-constrained sensors that communicate with a distant sink at a relatively low data rate with the help of a relay with higher-power and better-processing capabilities. We assume an orthogonal multiple access to the resources. Sources transmit independently and use simple short block codes to limit delay and complexity. The relay performs network encoding of the detected codewords and forwards either partial or complete coded information. The sink jointly decodes observations coming both from sources and relay to simultaneously estimate the information sent by the source nodes. We first analyse the cooperative scheme from an information theoretical point of view in order to determine the resource allocation strategy between the sources and the relay, which maximizes the overall network sum-rate. When a single relay is used and the source-to-relay link is not error-free, occasional detection errors introduce additional errors at the relay output, which, in turn, critically affect decoding performance and yield error-floors at the destination. In the case of a distributed coding scheme based on product codes, we obtain a closed-form asymptotically-tight approximation of the error probability under a minimum-distance decoding of the product code at the destination. The proposed analysis takes explicitly into account the error propagation at the relay output and may be extended to other forms of distributed coding schemes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Error probability","Upper bound","Encoding","Approximation methods","Product codes","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","block codes","channel allocation","communication complexity","cooperative communication","error statistics","forward error correction","optimisation","orthogonal codes","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum-rate optimization","performance analysis","distributed product code","sensor network","energy-and-complexity constrained sensor","distant sink","relay","orthogonal multiple access","block codes","limit delay","source node","cooperative scheme","resource allocation strategy","occasional detection error","distributed coding scheme","asymptotically tight approximation","error probability","minimum distance decoding","error propagation"]},{"kwd":["Channel capacity","cooperative systems","forward error correction","relays","sensor network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779691","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2314095","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6850111/06779691.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2314095","startPage":"3677","endPage":"3689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-Rate Optimization and Performance Analysis of Distributed Coding for Sensor Networks: Application to a Distributed Product Code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sum-Rate Optimization and Performance Analysis of Distributed Coding for Sensor Networks: Application to a Distributed Product Code","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779691/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","volume":"13","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6779691/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14430088","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum-Rate Optimization and Performance Analysis of Distributed Coding for Sensor Networks: Application to a Distributed Product Code","sourcePdf":"twc-amis-2314095-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081543S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6850111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","xplore-issue":"6850111","articleId":"6779691","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6779692,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Yazdani","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6850111/6779692/yazda-2314091-small.gif","p":["\nHassan Yazdani received the B.Sc.

IR-UWB signals are very sparse in time and, thus, MAI-plus-noise whitening cannot introduce intersymbol interference (ISI) in IR-UWB systems operating on an ideal free-space channel. In addition, ISI in UWB multipath fading channels can be eliminated by a proper choice of the frame duration. An analytical expression for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of IR-UWB systems after MAI-plus-noise whitening is derived and the SINR improvement due to whitening is investigated. It is shown that whitening can improve the performance of a variety of the well-known IR-UWB receivers, viz., soft-limiting, P-order metric, optimal, and the conventional matched filter receivers. It is also observed that MAI-plus-noise whitening can improve the overall SINR of the system and, thus, decrease the complexity of Rake receivers through reducing the number of their processing branches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Benefits of MAI-Plus-Noise Whitening in TH-BPSK IR-UWB Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2314091","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6850111/06779692.pdf","startPage":"3690","endPage":"3700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2314091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779692/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"On the Benefits of MAI-Plus-Noise Whitening in TH-BPSK IR-UWB Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6779692/","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14430078","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Benefits of MAI-Plus-Noise Whitening in TH-BPSK IR-UWB Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-rabiei-2314091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069364S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6850111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6850111","articleId":"6779692","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6779694,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NJ, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6874603/6779694/ding-2314114-small.gif","p":["\nZhiguo Ding (S'03\u2013M'05) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical\nengineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree\nin electrical engineering from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2005.

For the scenario with one source-destination pair, three different strategies for using the available relays are studied, and their impact on the outage probability and diversity gain is characterized by applying stochastic geometry. By using the assumptions that the path loss exponent is two and that the relay-destination distances are much larger than the source-relay distances, closed form analytical results can be developed to demonstrate that the use of energy harvesting relays can achieve the same diversity gain as the case with conventional self-powered relays. For the scenario with multiple sources, the relays can be viewed as a type of scarce resource, where the sources compete with each other to get help from the relays. Such a competition is modeled as a coalition formation game, and two distributed game theoretic algorithms are developed based on different payoff functions. Simulation results are provided to confirm the accuracy of the developed analytical results and facilitate a better performance comparison.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2314114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6874603/06779694.pdf","startPage":"4440","endPage":"4453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6874603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2314114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Cooperative Networks With Spatially Random Relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Cooperative Networks With Spatially Random Relays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779694/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14513483","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779694/","volume":"13","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Marie Curie International Fellowship"},{"fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/I037423/1"},{"fundingName":"U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-09-1-0643"},{"fundingName":"Research Promotion Foundation","grantNumber":"KOYLTOYRA/BP-NE/0613/04"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Cooperative Networks With Spatially Random Relays","sourcePdf":"twc-ding-2314114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092621S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6874603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"6874603","articleId":"6779694","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6779695,"authors":[{"name":"Ribhu Chopra","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6850111/6779695/chopr-2314125-small.gif","p":["\nRibhu Chopra (S'11) received the B.E. degree in electronics and\ncommunication engineering from Panjab University, Chandigarh, India, in 2009, and the M.Tech. degree in communication\nsystems from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India, in 2011.

It is shown that the detection performance in this case may be improved by enhancing the cyclostationary features of the signal of interest. The optimal filter for cyclostationary features is revisited, following which an adaptive space-time structure exploiting the spatial, temporal and spectral coherence of a cyclostationary signal incident upon an antenna array is proposed for enhancing the signal. A low complexity adaptation algorithm for this structure is also proposed. The performance of this detector is evaluated and compared with standard spectrum sensing methods. Simulation results show that a suitable space-time FRESH filtering configuration may be used to yield gains of up to 10 dB over both the standard energy detector and the traditional cyclostationary detector.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2314125","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6850111/06779695.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2314125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"3903","endPage":"3913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios Based on Space-Time FRESH Filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios Based on Space-Time FRESH Filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779695/","volume":"13","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6779695/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14430085","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios Based on Space-Time FRESH Filtering","sourcePdf":"twc-chopra-2314125-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119431S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6850111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6850111","articleId":"6779695","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6779696,"authors":[{"name":"Hina Tabassum","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6850111/6779696/tabas-2314101-small.gif","p":["\nHina Tabassum (S'11\u2013M'14) received the B.E. degree in electronic\nengineering from the N.E.D University of Engineering and Technology (NEDUET), Karachi, Pakistan, in 2004 and the\nmaster's and Ph.D. degree in communications engineering from NEDUET in 2009 and King Abdullah University of Science and\nTechnology (KAUST), Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia, in May 2013, respectively."," Currently, she is working as a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Manitoba (UoM), Canada.

The framework exploits the distance distributions from geometric probability theory to characterize the uplink interference while considering a traditional grid-model set-up for macrocells along with the randomly deployed femtocells. The derived expressions capture the impact of path-loss, composite shadowing and fading, uniform and non-uniform traffic loads, spatial distribution of femtocells, and partial and full spectral reuse among femtocells. Considering dedicated spectrum access, first, we derive the statistics of co-tier interference incurred at both femtocell and macrocell base stations (BSs) from a single interferer by approximating generalized-K composite fading distribution with the tractable Gamma distribution. We then derive the distribution of the number of interferers considering partial spectral reuse and moment generating function (MGF) of the cumulative interference for both partial and full spectral reuse scenarios. Next, we derive the statistics of the cross-tier interference at both femtocell and macrocell BSs considering shared spectrum access. Finally, we utilize the derived expressions to analyze the capacity in both dedicated and shared spectrum access scenarios. The derived expressions are validated by the Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results are generated to assess the feasibility of shared and dedicated spectrum access in femtocells under varying traffic load and spectral reuse scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2314101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6850111/06779696.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2314101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850111","startPage":"3837","endPage":"3852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Statistics and Capacity Analysis for Uplink Transmission in Two-Tier Small Cell Networks: A Geometric Probability Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference Statistics and Capacity Analysis for Uplink Transmission in Two-Tier Small Cell Networks: A Geometric Probability Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14430060","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779696/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"NPRP 4-353-2-130"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Statistics and Capacity Analysis for Uplink Transmission in Two-Tier Small Cell Networks: A Geometric Probability Approach","sourcePdf":"twc-tabassum-2314101-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147741S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6850111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6850111","articleId":"6779696","onlineDate":"27 March 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6779698,"authors":[{"name":"Guohui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6805240/6779698/6779698-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guohui Wang (S'11) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. degree in computer science from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

However, concurrent memory reading/writing in parallel turbo decoding architectures leads to severe memory conflict problem, which has become a major bottleneck for high throughput turbo decoders. In this paper, we propose a flexible and efficient VLSI architecture to solve the memory conflict problem for highly parallel turbo decoders targeting multi-standard 3G/4G wireless communication systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed parallel interleaver architecture, we implemented an HSPA +/LTE/LTE-Advanced multi-standard turbo decoder with a 45 nm CMOS technology. The implemented turbo decoder consists of 16 Radix-4 MAP decoder cores, and the chip core area is 2.43 mm \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

This change results in an over-all noise temperature of 3.5\u00b0K for these devices, rather than the 10\u00b0K exhibited by earlier masers. The maser noise temperature now closely approximates sky temperatures, which set the ultimate limit on earthbound receiver sensitivity. The improvements to be had by further reduction in amplifier noise are therefore almost negligible.

In this paper, we measure the entropy of prediction errors for two types of adaptive intra-interframe prediction algorithms. In the first case, that predictor which results in the least prediction error for previously transmitted neighboring pels is selected from a set of predictor functions. In the second case, prediction is a weighted sum of previous frame and intraframe predictions, where the weights are changed from pel to pel by gradient techniques. We also investigate various modifications of the basic methods. Further, a new type of variable length encoding in which the locations of the nonzero prediction errors are coded by horizontal run lengths is discussed. Compared with the pel entropy of previous frame prediction, the run length coding gives a gain of 2 to 16 percent, depending on the scene. Compared to simple previous frame prediction the first type of adaptive scheme in combination with horizontal run length coding provides a gain in entropy of 18 to 29 percent, whereas the second type of adaptive scheme provides a gain of 20 to 32 percent.","publicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"The Bell System Technical Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731005/6779756/06779760.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive intra-interframe DPCM coder","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1982.tb04311.x","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1982.tb04311.x","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"Nokia Bell Labs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1982","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive intra-interframe DPCM coder","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2014","publicationDate":"May-June 1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive intra-interframe DPCM coder","sourcePdf":"bstj615747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037287S","chronDate":"May-June  1982","isNumber":"6779756","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6731005","citationCount":"14","articleId":"6779760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"Bell Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6779817,"authors":[{"name":"Valentina Colla","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore S.

In the USA and UK, FCC and Ofcom, respectively, have made effort to allow opportunistic 'poaching' of licensed spectrum as long as communication of licensed user is not interfered with. This has focused research on use of cognitive radio, which would use its sensor networks to establish which TV channels are idle in order to allocate them temporarily to cellular networks.Enabling the cognitive radio to predict which channels shall lie idle at what times introduces better planning and more temporally-efficient allocation. This study explores the viability of predicting the times of mobile telephony traffic jam for a mobile service operator with poor QoS rating within a cell of perennial mobile traffic jam in order to explore whether those times can map well with the TV spectrum holes.

Fault measures/metrics are derived for weight stuck-at-zero fault. Experiments are conducted for four function approximation tasks wherein a set of 30 networks are trained for each task. A network which has a least validation error is selected for further analysis of weight stuck-at fault for the four function approximation tasks. The average change in the prediction error on single fault seeding is measured and compared with the predicted fault measure. Correlation between the derived fault measures and empirical measure of single fault seeding demonstrate that the correlation is significant at 0.10 level for both the derived measures, for one o f the derived measures, the correlation is significant at 0.05 level. Thus, these two derived measures are shown to be good metrics for the measurement of the fault tolerance of the network to single weight fault, at least for the two function approximation tasks. Further experimentation is required to empirically assess the validity of these measures.","doi":"10.1109/EMS.2013.11","publicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777804/6779803/06779822.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMS.2013.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779803","startPage":"61","endPage":"66","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metrics for Weight Stuck-at-Zero Fault in Sigmoidal FFANNs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Metrics for Weight Stuck-at-Zero Fault in Sigmoidal FFANNs","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779822/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14199507","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779822/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metrics for Weight Stuck-at-Zero Fault in Sigmoidal FFANNs","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"2578a061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07782S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777804","isNumber":"6779803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777804","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6779803","articleId":"6779822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6779824,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elbanhawi","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (SAMME), RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elbanhawi","id":"37085670464"},{"name":"Milan Simic","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (SAMME), RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Simic","id":"37683811200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2578-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2577-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6779824","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779824","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planning","Convergence","Robot kinematics","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","mobile robots","path planning","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling-based optimal motion planners","sampling based algorithms provide","robot motion planning problem","computational efficiency","sampling based planners","probability","sampling planning","asymptotic optimality","optimal solutions","convergence rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RRT","PRM","Sampling-Based","Optimal Planners","Motion","Planning"]}],"abstract":"Sampling based algorithms provide efficient methods of solving robot motion planning problem. The advantage of these approaches is the ease of their implementation and their computational efficiency. These algorithms are probabilistically complete i.e. they will find a solution if one exists, given a suitable run time. The drawback of sampling based planners is that there is no guarantee of the quality of their solutions. In fact, it was proven that their probability of reaching an optimal solution approaches zero. A breakthrough in sampling planning was the proposal of optimal based sampling planners. Current optimal planners are characterized with asymptotic optimality i.e. they reach an optimal solutions as time approaches infinity. Motivated by the slow convergence of optimal planners, post-processing and heuristic approach have been suggested. Due to the nature of the sampling based planners, their implementation requires tuning and selection of a large number of parameters that are often overlooked. This paper presents the performance study of an optimal planner under different parameters and heuristics. We also propose a modification in the algorithm to improve the convergence rate towards an optimal solution.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMS.2013.13","publicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777804/6779803/06779824.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"78","doi":"10.1109/EMS.2013.13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Sampling-Based Optimal Motion Planners","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Sampling-Based Optimal Motion Planners","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6779824/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14199485","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779824/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Sampling-Based Optimal Motion Planners","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"2578a073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08044S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777804","isNumber":"6779803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777804","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6779803","articleId":"6779824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6779825,"authors":[{"name":"Raja Subramani","affiliation":["Integrated Engineering Services, TECH MAHINDRA, India"],"firstName":"Raja","lastName":"Subramani","id":"37061271600"},{"name":"Haritima Swapnil","affiliation":["Integrated Engineering Services, TECH MAHINDRA, India"],"firstName":"Haritima","lastName":"Swapnil","id":"37061210900"},{"name":"Niharika Thakur","affiliation":["Integrated Engineering Services, TECH MAHINDRA, India"],"firstName":"Niharika","lastName":"Thakur","id":"37086684836"},{"name":"Bharath Radhakrishnan","affiliation":["Integrated Engineering Services, TECH MAHINDRA, India"],"firstName":"Bharath","lastName":"Radhakrishnan","id":"38220583100"},{"name":"Krishnamurthy Puttaiah","affiliation":["Integrated Engineering Services, TECH MAHINDRA, India"],"firstName":"Krishnamurthy","lastName":"Puttaiah","id":"37061184400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2578-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2577-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6779825","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1409},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Garbage Collection Algorithms for NAND Flash Memory Devices -- An Overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779825","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memories","Performance evaluation","Memory management","Solids","Power demand","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","NAND circuits","performance evaluation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["garbage collection algorithms","NAND flash memory devices","flash translation layer","FTL","SATA SSD","solid state devices","SSD performance","flash memory long term problems","flash memory reliability","threshold program limit","P-E cycles","wear leveling operations","WL operations","GC operations","flash management","flash page wear out","flash page write amplication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Garbage Collection","TRIM","HDD","SSD","SATA","Write Amplification","Wear Leveling","FTL"]}],"abstract":"This paper highlights the necessary garbage collection algorithms which is needed in flash translation layer (FTL) for NAND Flash memory devices such as SATA SSD's (Solid State Devices).

In RoF, the radio remote unit (RRU) utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, because of its increased data rate and its resilience to multipath fading. Also in optical fiber system, the optical components cannot be operated at high power, so their power needs to be reduced before inputting over the fiber. In OFDM transmission, it is necessary to estimate the channel to overcome the distortion caused by channel fading. The widely used channel estimation techniques are least square (LS) method and minimum mean square error (MMSE) method. However, they are preferred one over another for different scenarios. In this paper, we analyze and present modification in LS and MMSE method compromising between their complexity and performance for OFDM transmission in RoF distributed antenna system. We evaluate their performance through mean square error and bit error rate. We find that depending upon the estimator complexity, there can be considerable gain in signal to noise ratio (SNR) over the LS estimator. This considerable gain adds to the advantage of sending the signal with low power over the fiber before transmitting from RRU antenna.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM Channel Estimation in Radio over Fiber Distributed Antenna System","publicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","doi":"10.1109/EMS.2013.48","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777804/6779803/06779859.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMS.2013.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"OFDM Channel Estimation in Radio over Fiber Distributed Antenna System","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779859/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14199423","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM Channel Estimation in Radio over Fiber Distributed Antenna System","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"2578a277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042214S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777804","isNumber":"6779803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777804","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6779803","articleId":"6779859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6779884,"authors":[{"name":"Bunyamin Yagcitekin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Bunyamin","lastName":"Yagcitekin","id":"37077562400"},{"name":"Mehmet Uzunoglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Uzunoglu","id":"37270713800"},{"name":"Birol Ocal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Birol","lastName":"Ocal","id":"37086764159"},{"name":"Eren Turan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Eren","lastName":"Turan","id":"37086760417"},{"name":"Ahmet Tunc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Tunc","id":"37086765560"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2578-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2577-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6779884","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779884","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Electric vehicles","Substations","Load modeling","Power grids","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","educational institutions","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","campus area","smart charging management strategy","Floyd algorithm","parking space","power capacity control","substation loading data","voltage fluctuation","driver behavior","Yildiz Technical University","MATLAB","Simulink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electric vehicle","smart grid","smart charging","charging management","floyd algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to become popular together with the development of smart grid technologies.

Charging strategies are one of the most challenging concerns related to the charging of electric vehicle. In this study, smart charging management strategy is proposed through application of Floyd algorithm, parking space and power capacity control. Proposed strategy considers substation loading data, voltage fluctuation and behavior of drivers and tries to prevent the overloading of transformers. Survey analysis is made among the academic staff and university students in Yildiz Technical University to determine drivers' behaviors. Whole campus areas including the faculty buildings, substations, parking areas are modeled with MATLAB/Simulink.

The key of such flexibility is an efficient load balancer that offers better management and utilization of virtualized underlying cloud infrastructures. However, most of the existing load balancers in cloud computing are based on either centralized or fully distributed architectures while the idea of harnessing multiple load balancers in a hierarchical structure to improve the sever load and job response time is still under studied. Therefore, this paper, aims at bridging this gap by providing a comparative study between the three load balancing architectures in cloud computing: centralized, decentralized and hierarchical load balancers. The experimental results suggest that the hierarchical architecture for load balancers best suits the public cloud environment and call for further research to test whether these results can be generalized for other types of clouds.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777804/6779803/06779898.pdf","startPage":"520","endPage":"524","publicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","doi":"10.1109/EMS.2013.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMS.2013.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Load Balancing Architectures in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Computer architecture","Cloud computing","Servers","Load modeling","Time factors","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cost reduction","resource allocation","software architecture","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","load balancing architectures","cloud computing","distributed system","IT resources","utility services","cost reduction","flexible schemes","virtualized underlying cloud infrastructure management","virtualized underlying cloud infrastructure utilization","centralized architecture","distributed architecture","hierarchical structure","sever load improvement","job response time improvement","decentralized load balancer","hierarchical load balancer","public cloud environment","centralized load balancer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","cloud computing","load balancing","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Load Balancing Architectures in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14199417","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Load Balancing Architectures in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"2578a520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049117S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777804","isNumber":"6779803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777804","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6779803","articleId":"6779898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6779921,"authors":[{"name":"Nargis Bibi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Nargis","lastName":"Bibi","id":"38562679700"},{"name":"Anthony Kleerekoper","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Kleerekoper","id":"38468129200"},{"name":"Barry Cheetham","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Barry","lastName":"Cheetham","id":"38565755200"},{"name":"Nick Filer","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Nick","lastName":"Filer","id":"37269410000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2578-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2577-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6779921","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the digital modulation technique used by 4G and many other communication systems. OFDM waveforms have high amplitude fluctuations resulting in high Peak to Average Power Ratios (PAPR). This can make an OFDM transmitter susceptible to non-linear distortion produced by its high power amplifiers (HPA). Limiting the peaks before an OFDM signal is applied to the HPA causes in-band distortion which introduces bit-errors at the receiver additional to those due to additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). There have been many ideas for reducing the resulting bit-error rate. An Equation-Method is now proposed, based directly on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Clipped time-domain samples become the unknowns of a set of equations derived from the received constellation. The use of dither and recursion at the transmitter allows the receiver to identify reliable frequency-domain symbols which may be used to formulate the equations. This approach is receiver oriented and the receiver is assumed to know the clipping levels. Simulation results are presented to show that the Equation-Method performs well with severe clipping as compared to other receiver-oriented techniques such as the Buss gang noise cancellation (BNC) iterative receiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777804/6779803/06779921.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"656","publicationTitle":"2013 European

electrical cables. Using light to transmit data is much more efficient than electrical signals. Light polarized at a particular angle travels faster, this polarized light can then be modulated with the required data that needs to be transmitted using various modulation schemes. This report deals with the modeling of such a fiber optic network in Optiwave and studying the effects of transmission at high data rates on a single mode fiber. Using Optiwave a BPSK Signal has been modulated onto the carrier laser beam using Mach-Zehnder Interferometer modeled as a modulator. The Bit Error rate Q factor and Eye diagram has been analyzed for the best signal quality in three different cases of no polarization, linear polarization and circular polarization. The eye diagram provides details on best time to sample the signal, Signal to Noise Ratio and the transmission capacity of the system.","doi":"10.1109/EMS.2013.118","publicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 European Modelling Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel7/6777804/6779803/06779930.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMS.2013.118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779803","startPage":"701","endPage":"705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling PM-BPSK Signals for Coherent Optical Transmission over Single-Mode Fiber","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modelling PM-BPSK Signals for Coherent Optical Transmission over Single-Mode Fiber","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779930/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14210199","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779930/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling PM-BPSK Signals for Coherent Optical Transmission over Single-Mode Fiber","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"2578a701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120663S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6777804","isNumber":"6779803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6777804","xplore-issue":"6779803","articleId":"6779930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6779942,"authors":[{"name":"Fahime Garmisirian","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Shiraz University"],"firstName":"Fahime","lastName":"Garmisirian","id":"37086788677"},{"name":"Mahsa Mohaddesi","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Shiraz University"],"firstName":"Mahsa","lastName":"Mohaddesi","id":"37086788367"},{"name":"Zohre Azimifar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Shiraz University"],"firstName":"Zohre","lastName":"Azimifar","id":"37325226400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6184-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6182-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-6784"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-6776"}],"articleNumber":"6779942","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"abstract":"Locating an accurate desired object boundary using active contours and deformable models plays an important role in computer vision, particularly in medical imaging applications.

One approach for copyright protection is to embed an invisible signal, known as a digital watermark, in the image. One of the most important features of an effective watermarking scheme is transparency. A good watermarking method should be invisible such that human eye could not distinguish the dissimilarities between the watermarked image and the original one. On the other hand, a watermarked image should be robust against intentional and unintentional attacks. There is an inherent tradeoff between transparency and robustness. It is desired to keep both properties as high as possible In this paper we propose the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the most suitable areas of an image for embedding. This ANN is trained based on the human visual system (HVS) model. Only blocks which produce least amount of perceivable changes are selected by this method. This block selection method can aid many of the existing embedding techniques. We have implemented our block selection method in addition to a simple watermarking method. Our results show a noticeable improvement of imperceptibility in our approach compared to other methods.","doi":"10.1109/IranianMVIP.2013.6779945","startPage":"33","endPage":"37","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th Iranian Conference on Machine Vision and Image Processing (MVIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6755861/6779938/06779945.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 8th Iranian Conference on Machine Vision and Image Processing (MVIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianMVIP.2013.6779945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transparent watermarking based on psychovisual properties using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Artificial neural networks","Sensitivity","Training","Robustness","Visual systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copyright","image watermarking","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparent watermarking","psychovisual property","neural networks","digital media","copyrights","digital contents","copyright protection","digital image watermark","watermarking scheme","transparency","watermarking method","human eye","watermarked image","unintentional attack","robustness","artificial neural network","ANN","human visual system model","HVS model","block selection method","embedding technique","noticeable improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["watermarking","imperceptibility","psychovisual","HVS","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779945/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Transparent watermarking based on psychovisual properties using neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6779945/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14199049","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transparent watermarking based on psychovisual properties using neural networks","confLoc":"Zanjan, Iran","sourcePdf":"007033231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098603S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6755861","isNumber":"6779938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6755861","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6779938","articleId":"6779945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6779949,"authors":[{"name":"Samad Roohi","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Arts, Islamic Art University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Samad","lastName":"Roohi","id":"38469311300"},{"name":"Majid Noorhosseini","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Engineering and Information Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Noorhosseini","id":"37302883800"},{"name":"Jafar Zamani","affiliation":["Dept. of Biomedical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Jafar","lastName":"Zamani","id":"38469667600"},{"name":"Hamidreza Salighe Rad","affiliation":["Dept. of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Research Center for Science and Technology in Medicine (RCSTIM), Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamidreza Salighe","lastName":"Rad","id":"37086659760"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6184-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6182-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-6784"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-6776"}],"articleNumber":"6779949","dbTime":"45 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Machine vision","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","conjugate gradient methods","image reconstruction","sparse matrices","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity distributed video coding","compressed sensing","nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm","NLCG","groups of pictures","GOP","PSNR","SSIM","RSE","Gaussian sampling matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing (CS)","distributed video coding (DVC)","sparse reconstruction","nonlinear conjugate gradient (NLCG)"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sensing (CS) is an efficient method to reconstruct sparse images with under-sampled data. In this method sensing and coding steps integrated to a one-step, low-complexity measurement acquisition system. In this paper, we use a Non-linear Conjugate Gradient (NLCG) algorithm to significantly increase the quality of reconstructed frames of video sequences. Our proposed framework divides sequence of a video to several groups of pictures (GOPs), where each GOP consisting of one key frame followed by two non-key frames. CS is then applied on each key and non-key frame with different sampling rates. For reconstruction final frames, NLCG algorithm was performed on each key frame with acceptable fidelity. To achieve desired quality on low-rate sampled non-key frames, NLCG modified using side information (SI) obtained from last two successive reconstructed key frames. Based on some performance measures such as SNR, PSNR, SSIM and RSE, our implementation results indicate that employing NLCG with Gaussian sampling matrix outperforms other methods in quality measures.","doi":"10.1109/IranianMVIP.2013.6779949","publicationTitle":"2013 8th Iranian Conference on Machine Vision and Image Processing (MVIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th Iranian Conference on Machine Vision and Image Processing (MVIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6755861/6779938/06779949.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianMVIP.2013.6779949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779938","startPage":"53","endPage":"57","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity distributed video coding using compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6779949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity distributed video coding using compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6779949/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14199040","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6779949/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity distributed video coding using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Zanjan, Iran","sourcePdf":"011053454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072924S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6755861","isNumber":"6779938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6755861","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6779938","articleId":"6779949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6779960,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Azizabadi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Azizabadi","id":"37086740162"},{"name":"Alireza Behrad","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Behrad","id":"37294559200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6184-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6182-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-6784"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-6776"}],"articleNumber":"6779960","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Filtering algorithms","Nonlinear filters","Maximum likelihood detection","Software","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","Gaussian noise","image processing","median filters","optimisation","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC","IC area","maximum clock frequency","filter optimization","weighted median filter","Gaussian filter","video processing algorithm","image processing algorithm","image filtering","hardware architecture design","VLSI implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gaussian filter","Median filter","Weighted Median filter","hardware architecture","ASIC implementation","Real-time processing"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays, hardware implementation of image and video processing algorithms is highly attractive.

Next, we use spectral clustering to classify behaviors wherein pixels that have similar behavior features are clustered together. Then we obtain a behavior model for each cluster using the normal distribution of the samples.
