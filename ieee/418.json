One is the traditional connection-based model, which views node mobility as undesirable and tries to either remove (through recovery schemes) or mask (through tolerant schemes) the effect of mobility. The other is the mobility-assisted model, which considers mobility as a desirable feature, where routing is based on the store-carry-forward paradigm with random or controlled movement of mobile nodes (called ferries). It is well known that mobility increases the capacity of MANETs by reducing the number of relays in routing. Surprisingly, only two models, diameter hop count in the connection-based model and constant hop count in the mobility-assisted model, which correspond to two extremes of the spectrum, have been systematically studied. In this paper, we propose a new routing model that deals with message routing, as well as trajectory planning, of the ferries that carry the message. A logarithmic number of relays are enforced to achieve a good balance among several contradictory goals, including increasing network capacity, increasing ferry sharing, and reducing moving distance. The model considers the dynamic control of ferries in terms of the number of ferries, trajectory planning of ferries, and node communication and synchronization. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated analytically, as well as through simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4180338/04180342.pdf","startPage":"735","endPage":"748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4180338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4180342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logarithmic Store-Carry-Forward Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Mobile ad hoc networks","Relays","Trajectory","Communication system control","Protective relaying","Protocols","Educational institutions","Mobile communication","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","mobility management (mobile radio)","routing protocols","synchronisation","telecommunication network planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logarithmic store-carry-forward routing","mobile ad hoc network","mobility-assisted model","trajectory planning","synchronization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MANETs","mobile nodes","network capacity","store-carry-forward","trajectory planning."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4180342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Logarithmic Store-Carry-Forward Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4180342/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9481933","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logarithmic Store-Carry-Forward Routing in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"l0735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115181S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4180338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4180338","articleId":"4180342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4180344,"authors":[{"name":"Jihoon Myung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Information and Communications, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4180338/4180344/4180344-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jihoon Myung received the BS degree in computer science and engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004.

A RFID reader recognizes tags through communication over a shared wireless channel. When multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously, the tag-to-reader signals collide and this collision disturbs a reader's identification process. Therefore, tag collision arbitration for passive tags is a significant issue for fast identification. This paper presents two adaptive tag anticollision protocols: an adaptive query splitting protocol (AQS), which is an improvement on the query tree protocol, and an adaptive binary splitting protocol (ABS), which is based on the binary tree protocol and is a de facto standard for RFID anticollision protocols. To reduce collisions and identify tags efficiently, adaptive tag anticollision protocols use information obtained from the last process of tag identification. Our performance evaluation shows that AQS and ABS outperform other tree-based tag anticollision protocols","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2007.1020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4180338/04180344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2007.1020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4180338","startPage":"763","endPage":"775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tag-Splitting: Adaptive Collision Arbitration Protocols for RFID Tag Identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4180344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tag-Splitting: Adaptive Collision Arbitration Protocols for RFID Tag Identification","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4180344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9503994","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4180344/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tag-Splitting: Adaptive Collision Arbitration Protocols for RFID Tag Identification","sourcePdf":"l0763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101574S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4180338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4180338","articleId":"4180344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4180346,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Tsafrir","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4180338/4180346/4180346-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dan Tsafrir received the BSc (cum laude), MSc, and PhD degrees from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1998, 2002, and 2006, respectively.

Backfilling means that short jobs are allowed to run ahead of their time provided they do not delay previously queued jobs (or at least the first queued job). However, predictions have not been incorporated into production schedulers, partially due to a misconception (that we resolve) claiming inaccuracy actually improves performance, but mainly because underprediction is technically unacceptable: users will not tolerate jobs being killed just because system predictions were too short. We solve this problem by divorcing kill-time from the runtime prediction and correcting predictions adaptively as needed if they are proved wrong. The end result is a surprisingly simple scheduler, which requires minimal deviations from current practices (e.g., using FCFS as the basis) and behaves exactly like EASY as far as users are concerned; nevertheless, it achieves significant improvements in performance, predictability, and accuracy. Notably, this is based on a very simple runtime predictor that just averages the runtimes of the last two jobs by the same user; counter intuitively, our results indicate that using recent data is more important than mining the history for similar jobs. All the techniques suggested in this paper can be used to enhance any backfilling algorithm and are not limited to EASY","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4180346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9481935","htmlLink":"/document/4180346/","displayDocTitle":"Backfilling Using System-Generated Predictions Rather than User Runtime Estimates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backfilling Using System-Generated Predictions Rather than User Runtime Estimates","sourcePdf":"l0789.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126022S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4180338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"214","xplore-issue":"4180338","articleId":"4180346","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4180364,"authors":[{"name":"O.

This control amplifier is composed of a fire-control circuit and a \"bridge\" power output circuit. The input signal is used to control the firing angle of the two inverse parallel pairs of SCRs in the full-wave power bridge. The relation between the input signal and the firing angle is designed to be the inverse of the non-linearity introduced by the power circuit. Therefore, the amplifier has an overall linear gain characteristic, it is bidirectional, has a high bandwidth, and exhibits no deadband. The power bridge balancing action is used to absorb the major portion of the negative power pulse caused by an inductive load and therefore improves the efficiency of the amplifier. The linear SCR control amplifier has been built and successfully tested with resistive-inductive loads as well as in a closed-loop positioning servo system. The testing results and the simplicity of instrumentation qualify this control amplifier for industrial applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4180954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1968","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1968","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 1968","volume":"IGA-4","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Linear SCR Control Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Linear SCR Control Amplifier","sourcePdf":"TIGA-vIGA-4-n6-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034476S","chronDate":"Nov.  1968","isNumber":"4180944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4180499","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4180954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1968","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4181239,"authors":[{"name":"Lawrence E.

A simple equivalent circuit method is presented for estimating the magnitude of torque fluctuations under steady-state operating conditions based on single-phase equivalent circuits. The method indicates that torque fluctuations are due mainly to the interaction of fundamental flux in the air gap at harmonic rotor currents. Inverters producing a 6-stepped voltage waveform, the predominant pulsating torque is at the sixth harmonic and the magnitude of the fluctuation is independent of operating frequency, provided that constant volts per Hz is maintained. The method is extendable to PWM inverter-machine systems with similar conclusions with respect to variation of torque over the input frequency range. However, for the PWM inverter with a fixed number of pulses per cycle, the torque pulsations can approach or exceed full-load average torque. The method outlined is simple and amenable to hand calculations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIGA.1971.4181297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4181278","startPage":"318","endPage":"323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry and General Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4180499/4181278/04181297.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque Pulsations in Induction Motors with Inverter Drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4181297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1971","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1971","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Torque Pulsations in Induction Motors with Inverter Drives","publicationDate":"March 1971","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"IGA-7","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque Pulsations in Induction Motors with Inverter Drives","sourcePdf":"TIGA-vIGA-7-n2-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034196S","chronDate":"March  1971","isNumber":"4181278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4180499","citationCount":"61","articleId":"4181297","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1971","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4181326,"authors":[{"name":"William McMurray","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, General Electric Company Limited, Schenectady, NY, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"McMurray","id":"37294795500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-943X"}],"articleNumber":"4181326","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":684},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Thyristor Electronic Transformer: a Power Converter Using a High-Frequency Link","abstract":"The electronic transformer is a device which behaves in the same manner as a conventional power transformer in that it steps voltage levels up or down while providing isolation and can accommodate load current of any power factor.

The breakdown voltage of a SF6 gas gap for DC voltage is approximately 80 percent of that for AC crest value at pressure of 3.5kg/cm2 abs., while an epoxy cast gap withstands the DC voltage by 1.7 times of the AC crest value. However, when the short epoxy cast gap is subjected to the combined voltage of DC and switching impulse of reverse polarity, the switching impulse breakdown voltage is strongly affected by the preset level of DC voltage. On the other hand, the superposed switching impulse breakdown voltages of conical insulators, for supporting a high voltage conductor in a cylindrical enclosure, are only slightly influenced by the DC voltage of reverse polarity. Therefore the combination of SFb gas and epoxy resin may be used effectively as an insulation system of the HVDC gas insulated substation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC Dielectric Strength of a SF6 Gas Insulated System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPAS.1978.354472","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/10669/4181391/04181416.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAS.1978.354472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4181391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4181416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4181416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1978","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1978","displayDocTitle":"DC Dielectric Strength of a SF6 Gas Insulated System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"PAS-97","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 1978","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC Dielectric Strength of a SF6 Gas Insulated System","sourcePdf":"TPAS-vPAS-97-n1-25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027314S","chronDate":"Jan.  1978","isNumber":"4181391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10669","citationCount":"28","articleId":"4181416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4181439,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, we introduce a new modeling approach to the Web service selection problem that is particularly effective for large processes and when QoS constraints are severe. In the model, the Web service selection problem is formalized as a mixed integer linear programming problem, loops peeling is adopted in the optimization, and constraints posed by stateful Web services are considered. Moreover, negotiation techniques are exploited to identify a feasible solution of the problem, if one does not exist.

Despite improvements in FPGA densities, the numerous multipliers in an NN limit the size of the network that can be implemented using a single FPGA, thus making NN applications not viable commercially. The proposed implementation is aimed at reducing resource requirement, without much compromise on the speed, so that a larger NN can be realized on a single chip at a lower cost. The sequential processing of the layers in an NN has been exploited in this paper to implement large NNs using a method of layer multiplexing. Instead of realizing a complete network, only the single largest layer is implemented. The same layer behaves as different layers with the help of a control block. The control block ensures proper functioning by assigning the appropriate inputs, weights, biases, and excitation function of the layer that is currently being computed. Multilayer networks have been implemented using Xilinx FPGA \"XCV400hq240.\" The concept used is shown to be very effective in reducing resource requirements at the cost of a moderate overhead on speed. This implementation is proposed to make NN applications viable in terms of cost and speed for online applications.

In n words recognition, n SRNFNs are created for modeling n words, where each SRNFN receives the current frame feature and predicts the next one of its modeling word. The prediction error of each SRNFN is used as recognition criterion. In filtering, one SRNFN is created, and each SRNFN recognizer is connected to the same SRNFN filter, which filters noisy speech patterns in the feature domain before feeding them to the SRNFN recognizer. Experiments with Mandarin word recognition under different types of noise are performed.

The principal controller containing an RCMAC uncertainty observer is the main controller, and the compensation controller is a compensator for the approximation error of the system uncertainty. In addition, in order to relax the requirement of approximation error bound, an estimation law is derived to estimate the error bound. The Taylor linearization technique is employed to increase the learning ability of RCMAC and the adaptive laws of the control system are derived based on Lyapunov stability theorem and Barbalat's lemma so that the asymptotical stability of the system can be guaranteed. Finally, the proposed design method is applied to control a biped robot.

Neural structures under consideration belong to the class of the so-called locally recurrent globally feedforward networks. The single processing unit possesses dynamic behavior. It is realized by introducing into the neuron structure a linear dynamic system in the form of an infinite impulse response filter. In this way, a dynamic neural network is obtained. It is well known that the crucial problem with neural networks of the dynamic type is stability as well as stabilization in learning problems. The paper formulates stability conditions for the analyzed class of neural networks. Moreover, a stabilization problem is defined and solved as a constrained optimization task. In order to tackle this problem two methods are proposed. The first one is based on a gradient projection (GP) and the second one on a minimum distance projection (MDP). It is worth noting that these methods can be easily introduced into the existing learning algorithm as an additional step, and suitable convergence conditions can be developed for them. The efficiency and usefulness of the proposed approaches are justified by using a number of experiments including numerical complexity analysis, stabilization effectiveness, and the identification of an industrial process","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.891199","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4182365/04182402.pdf","startPage":"660","endPage":"673","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.891199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4182365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability Analysis and the Stabilization of a Class of Discrete-Time Dynamic Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4182402/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Stability Analysis and the Stabilization of a Class of Discrete-Time Dynamic Neural Networks","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9437828","pubMedId":"17526334","publicationDate":"May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability Analysis and the Stabilization of a Class of Discrete-Time Dynamic Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"18tnn03-patan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070167S","chronDate":"May  2007","isNumber":"4182365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"42","articleId":"4182402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4182404,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique Romero","affiliation":["Departament de Llenguatges i Sistemes Inform\u00e0tics, Universitat Polilt\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Romero","id":"37285935200"},{"name":"Daniel Toppo","affiliation":["I&C School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Toppo","id":"37298518300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4182404","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4182404","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Fuzzy control","Support vector machine classification","Machine learning","Kernel","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector machines","feedforward neural networks","similar hidden-layer weights","basis functions","sparse models","sequential FNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feedforward neural networks (FNNs)","sparse models","support vector machines (SVMs)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Information Storage and Retrieval","Models, Statistical","Neural Networks (Computer)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.891656","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4182365/04182404.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"959","endPage":"963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4182365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.891656","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Support Vector Machines and Feedforward Neural Networks With Similar Hidden-Layer Weights","abstract":"Support vector machines (SVMs) usually need a large number of support vectors to form their output. Recently, several models have been proposed to build SVMs with a small number of basis functions, maintaining the property that their hidden-layer weights are a subset of the data (the support vectors). This property is also present in some algorithms for feedforward neural networks (FNNs) that construct the network sequentially, leading to sparse models where the number of hidden units can be explicitly controlled. An experimental study on several benchmark data sets, comparing SVMs and the aforementioned sequential FNNs, was carried out. The experiments were performed in the same conditions for all the models, and they can be seen as a comparison of SVMs and FNNs when both models are restricted to use similar hidden-layer weights. Accuracies were found to be very similar. Regarding the number of support vectors, sequential FNNs constructed models with less hidden units than standard SVMs and in the same range as \"sparse\" SVMs. Computational times were lower for SVMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4182404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9437861","pubMedId":"17526367","volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4182404/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparing Support Vector Machines and Feedforward Neural Networks With Similar Hidden-Layer Weights","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Support Vector Machines and Feedforward Neural Networks With Similar Hidden-Layer Weights","sourcePdf":"18tnn03-romero-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047481S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4182365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4182365","articleId":"4182404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4182412,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Koos","affiliation":["Institute of High-Frequency and Quantum Electronics, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Koos","id":"38019575900"},{"name":"Christopher G.

The power loop adjusts the lamp power in steady state and the voltage loop controls the PFC during the ignition and warm-up time. System stability is studied to verify that the PFC stage provides the ballast with the required stability in long and medium term, while the short term stability is assured by the high output impedance of the LCC inverter, operating in open loop at constant switching frequency. The resulting performance of the ballast shows improvements in ignition repeatability, warm-up time reduction, robustness of the resonant inverter operation, and simple and accurate power control, including dimming operation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microcontrollers","Power factor correction","High intensity discharge lamps","Electronic ballasts","Resonant inverters","Stability","Voltage control","Ignition","Control systems","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","discharge lamps","lamp accessories","microcontrollers","power control","power factor correction","resonant invertors","stability","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcontroller","power mode stabilized power factor correction","high intensity discharge lamp","electronic ballast","two-stage ballast system","PFC","resonant inverter","voltage loop controls","ignition","system stability","constant switching frequency","power control","dimming operation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dimming","electronic ballast","lighting","power factor correction (PFC)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.896509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4182441/04182444.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4182441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.896509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microcontroller Power Mode Stabilized Power Factor Correction Stage for High Intensity Discharge Lamp Electronic Ballast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4182444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microcontroller Power Mode Stabilized Power Factor Correction Stage for High Intensity Discharge Lamp Electronic Ballast","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4182444/","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4182444/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9436241","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microcontroller Power Mode Stabilized Power Factor Correction Stage for High Intensity Discharge Lamp Electronic Ballast","sourcePdf":"22tpel03-azcondo2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064172S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4182441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4182441","articleId":"4182444","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4182447,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Branas","affiliation":["Electronics Technology, Systems and Automation Engineering Department, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4182441/4182447/4182447-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Bra\u00f1as (M'03) was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1970.

To meet display performance requirement that chromaticity variation Deltauv needs to be limited below 0.002, this paper also proposes a family of output current ripple free topologies to control the average driving current precisely, which in turn can reduce chromaticity variation. In addition, an LED bypass circuit is proposed to prevent LED arrays from open-circuit, and a driving voltage resetter is introduced to eliminate current spikes, improving backlight reliability and availability significantly.

To avoid the inherent acoustic-resonance problem of MH lamps, the switching frequency is chosen to be above 1MHz. Furthermore, in order to satisfy higher magnitudes of maximum electromagnetic interference limitation at frequencies of between 2.5 to 3.0MHz, the ballast's switching-frequency level was selected to be 2.65MHz, which falls within the frequency range \"chimney,\" for radio-frequency lighting systems, such as electrode-less fluorescent lamps. The conventional self-oscillating electronic ballast is disadvantageous because the lamp current varies according to the input voltage. This difference in lamp current causes poor color rendering index for the lamp. In order to solve this issue for the self-oscillating electronic ballast, the constant-lamp-current control circuit is proposed to provide constant lamp current. Finally, a 20W self-oscillating ballast with the proposed constant-lamp-current control for MH lamps is implemented in order to demonstrate the ability to avoid acoustic resonance and to provide constant levels of lamp current","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic ballasts","Electromagnetic interference","Radio frequency","Fluorescent lamps","Circuits","Resonance","Switching frequency","Voltage","Shape","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic resonance","electric current control","electromagnetic interference","lamp accessories","metal vapour lamps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-oscillating electronic ballast","constant lamp current control","metal halide lamp","acoustic resonance problem","switching frequency","electromagnetic interference limitation","radiofrequency lighting systems","electrodeless fluorescent lamps","2.5 to 3.0 MHz","20 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color rendering index (CRI)","electromagnetic interference (EMI)","metal halide (MH)","radio-frequency (RF)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.896508","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4182441/04182469.pdf","startPage":"839","endPage":"844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4182441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.896508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2.65-MHz Self-Oscillating Electronic Ballast With Constant-Lamp-Current Control for Metal Halide Lamp","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4182469","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"2.65-MHz Self-Oscillating Electronic Ballast With Constant-Lamp-Current Control for Metal Halide Lamp","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4182469/","volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4182469/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9436240","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2.65-MHz Self-Oscillating Electronic Ballast With Constant-Lamp-Current Control for Metal Halide Lamp","sourcePdf":"22tpel03-lin3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091677S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4182441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4182441","articleId":"4182469","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4182471,"authors":[{"name":"Poh Chiang Loh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4182441/4182471/4182471-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Poh Chiang Loh (S'01\u2013M'04) received the B.Eng (with honors) and M.Eng degrees from the National University of Singapore, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Monash University, Victoria, Australia, in 2002.","During the Summer 2001, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Wisconsin Electric Machine and Power Electronics Consortium, University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he worked on multilevel inverter control and its synchronized implementation.

In principle, the designed Z-source inverter functions by selectively \"shooting through\" its power sources, coupled to the inverter using two unique Z-source impedance networks, to boost the inverter three-level output waveform. Proper modulation of the new inverter would therefore require careful integration of the selective shoot-through process to the basic switching concepts to achieve maximal voltage-boost, minimal harmonic distortion, lower semiconductor stress, and minimal number of device commutations per switching cycle. To date, the theoretical background on Z-source NPC modulation has not been fully established, and it is the theme of this paper to propose a number of enhanced voltage-boost pulsewidth modulation (PWM) strategies for controlling the Z-source NPC inverter.

The increased use of nonlinear devices in industry has resulted in direct increase of harmonic distortion in the industrial power system in recent years. Interaction between loads and sources in a power distribution network is a complex process and often not possible to explain analytically without making assumptions. The determination of true harmonic current distortion of a load is further complicated by the fact that the supply voltage waveform at the point of common coupling (PCC) is rarely a pure sinusoid. This paper proposes a neural network based method to find a way of distinguishing between load contributed harmonics and supply harmonics, without disconnecting any load from the network. A neural network structure with memory is used to model the admittance of the nonlinear load. Once training is achieved, the neural network predicts the true harmonic current of the load if it could be supplied with a clean sine wave. The main advantage of this method is that only waveforms of voltages and currents have to be measured and is applicable for single phase as well as multiphase loads. This could be integrated into a commercially available power quality instrument or be fabricated as a standalone instrument that could be installed in substations of large customer loads, or used as a hand-held clip on instrument","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2007.897109","startPage":"1036","endPage":"1045","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2007.897109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4182441","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4182441/04182472.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Based Method for Predicting Nonlinear Load Harmonics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4182472/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Method for Predicting Nonlinear Load Harmonics","volume":"22","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4182472/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9436263","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Method for Predicting Nonlinear Load Harmonics","sourcePdf":"22tpel03-mazumdar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140383S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4182441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4182441","articleId":"4182472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":4182474,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Zheng Peng","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4182441/4182474/4182474-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fang Zheng Peng (M'92\u2013SM'96\u2013F'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1983 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan, in 1987 and 1990, respectively.","He joined Toyo Electric Manufacturing Company, Ltd., from 1990 to 1992 as a Research Scientist, and was engaged in research and development of active power filters, flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) applications, and motor drives.

The Z-source inverter utilizes an exclusive Z-source (LC) network to link the main inverter circuit to the FC (or any dc power source). By substituting one of the capacitors in the Z-source with a battery and controlling the shoot through duty ratio and modulation index independently, one is able to control the FC power, output power, and SOC of the battery at the same time.

This paper presents electronic ballasts using ac-ac converters without a PFC stage. The use of an indirect ac-ac converter, or an indirect frequency changer, to feed the HPS lamp is investigated. Modulation strategies are proposed to improve the input and output characteristics of the converter. Further studies lead to a novel HPS electronic ballast which uses an ac chopper capable of achieving PFC and supplying high frequency to the lamp. Different converter topologies, bidirectional switches, and a modulation strategy for the ac chopper are presented. Due to the output characteristic of both topologies, the lamp current is modulated at the frequency of the voltage source and the consequences of this operation are discussed.

Accordingly, an electronic ballast normally comprises a buck converter to control the lamp current magnitude and a full-bridge to commutate the lamp current at a low frequency. In such a system, the negative dynamic lamp characteristic may interact with the power electronic driver may give a poorly damped response, sometimes resulting in an oscillatory lamp current. Furthermore, lamp aging and reduced power mode operation both tend to increase re-ignition voltage overshoot, which in turn may lead to reduced lifetime, or prematurely extinguishing lamps. In the present paper, a procedure for obtaining the small-signal dynamic characteristics of metal halide lamps is proposed. Using this dynamic model, the lamp-ballast interaction is simulated and analyzed. A fuzzy-logic control method is presented to cope with nonlinear behavior and improve the lamp-ballast performance.

It is composed of a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) rectifier directly tied to the generator's terminals without ac reactors. Hence terminal voltages are not useful due to the switched pulse of the PWM rectifier and also it is not the terminal voltages, but the generator's electromagnetic field voltages that are required for a synchronous angle of the PWM rectifier. This paper proposes a method for estimating the synchronous angle through only the measurement of the ac line currents, and is thus called the voltage sensorless control strategy. For a smooth startup of the PWM rectifier, a technique of setting the integrators' initial values in the proposed estimator is described. In this paper a commercial engine generator set is used as the distributed generation system.

A first-order mismatch-shaping DAC using un-dithered switching sequences for the switching blocks results in spurious tones in the DAC noise. The unwanted tones can be eliminated from the DAC noise by employing white dither sequences to randomly select two types of short root symbols to be placed in the switching sequences. Dithered switching sequences, unfortunately, result in a higher noise floor in the DAC noise, in comparison with un-dithered switching sequences. In this brief, we propose an improved first-order sequencing logic to eliminate unwanted tones while causing only a modest increase in the in-band noise floor at a very modest hardware cost. Our mismatch-shaping sequencing logic is based on the scheme using a white dither sequence to randomly select each symbol between two specific types of long root symbols. Alternatively, our scheme can be viewed as using a high-pass dither sequence to randomly select the short root symbols. An analytical formula for the power-spectral density of the proposed switching sequence is presented to show its improvement over the prior first-order switching sequence. It is also shown from numerical simulations that the proposed switching sequence improves the signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio by more than 5 dB for a sigma-delta modulator with static DAC-element errors chosen from a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 1%","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.892397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4182491/04182501.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.892397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4182491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A First-Order Tree-Structured DAC With Reduced Signal-Band Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4182501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4182501/","displayDocTitle":"A First-Order Tree-Structured DAC With Reduced Signal-Band Noise","volume":"54","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9450341","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4182501/","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A First-Order Tree-Structured DAC With Reduced Signal-Band Noise","sourcePdf":"54tcsii05-hsieh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102068S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4182491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4182491","articleId":"4182501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4182503,"authors":[{"name":"Vadim Ivanov","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Vadim","lastName":"Ivanov","id":"37272432400"},{"name":"Junlin Zhou","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Junlin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291311800"},{"name":"Igor M.
