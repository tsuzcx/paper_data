The proposed unsupervised competitive neural network, called the divergence-based centroid neural network (DCNN), employs the divergence measure as its distance measure and utilizes the statistical characteristics of observation densities in the HMM for speech recognition problems. While the conventional clustering algorithms used for the vector quantization (VQ) codebook design utilize only the mean values of the observation densities in the HMM, the proposed DCNN utilizes both the mean and the covariance values. When compared with other conventional unsupervised neural networks, the DCNN successfully allocates more code vectors to the regions where GPDF data are densely distributed while it allocates fewer code vectors to the regions where GPDF data are sparsely distributed. When applied to Korean monophone recognition problems as a tool to reduce the size of the codebook, the DCNN reduced the number of GPDFs used for code vectors by 65.3% while preserving recognition accuracy.

In this proposed model, every component of the neuron's activation function belongs to a convex hull which is bounded by two odd symmetric piecewise linear functions that are convex or concave over the real space. All of the convex hulls are composed of generalized activation function classes. The novel activation function class is not only with a more flexible and more specific description of the activation functions than other function classes but it also generalizes some traditional activation function classes. The absolute exponential stability (AEST) of the RNN with a generalized activation function class is studied through three steps. The first step is to demonstrate the global exponential stability (GES) of the equilibrium point of original RNN with a generalized activation function being equivalent to that of RNN under all vertex functions of convex hull. The second step transforms the RNN under every vertex activation function into neural networks under an array of saturated linear activation functions. Because the GES of the equilibrium point of three systems are equivalent, the next stability analysis focuses on the GES of the equilibrium point of RNN system under an array of saturated linear activation functions. The last step is to study both the existence of equilibrium point and the GES of the RNN under saturated linear activation functions using the theory of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-matrix.

When such hypothesis does not hold, e.g., in applications affected by aging effects, drifts, deviations, and faults, classifiers must react just in time, i.e., exactly when needed, to track the process evolution. The first step in designing effective just-in-time classifiers requires detection of the temporal instant associated with the process change, and the second one needs an update of the knowledge base used by the classification system to track the process evolution. This paper addresses the change detection aspect leaving the design of just-in-time adaptive classification systems to a companion paper. Two completely automatic tests for detecting nonstationarity phenomena are suggested, which neither require a priori information nor assumptions about the process generating the data. In particular, an effective computational intelligence-inspired test is provided to deal with multidimensional situations, a scenario where traditional change detection methods are generally not applicable or scarcely effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470009/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4470009/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10160392","volume":"19","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Just-in-Time Adaptive Classifiers\u2014Part I: Detecting Nonstationary Changes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Just-in-Time Adaptive Classifiers\u2014Part I: Detecting Nonstationary Changes","sourcePdf":"19tnn00-alippi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099745S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4558069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4558069","articleId":"4470009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4470033,"authors":[{"name":"Kazunori Kobayashi","affiliation":["NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/4470011/4470033/4470033-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kazunori Kobayashi received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Electronic System Engineering from Nagaoka University of Technology in 1997, 1999, and 2003.

A 100-W average power transmitter is characterized; various delay values are applied to align the input and output data; and, a model is derived for each delay value. The models' performances, evaluated for these delay values both in time and frequency domains, demonstrate that the memory polynomial model is sensitive to delay overestimation but not to delay underestimation. It is established that a delay underestimation by up to one sampling period does not affect the performance of the identified model. This overcomes the need for the signal oversampling required for high-resolution delay alignment. Consequently, the computational complexity of the digital signal processing algorithm employed for delay estimation and alignment is considerably reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470110/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920823","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4470110/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On The Sensitivity of RF Transmitters' Memory Polynomial Model Identification to Delay Alignment Resolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On The Sensitivity of RF Transmitters' Memory Polynomial Model Identification to Delay Alignment Resolution","sourcePdf":"18lmwc04-hammi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051139S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"4479593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4479593","articleId":"4470110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":4470112,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Wook Min","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Byung-Wook","lastName":"Min","id":"37575153400"},{"name":"Gabriel M.

In practice, large deviations of solder thickness from a nominal value result in SMT defects that may cause PCB failure. This paper implements the define-measure-analyze-improve-control (DMAIC) approach to improve the capability of the solder paste printing process by reducing thickness variations from a nominal value. Process mapping and identifying key QCH are carried out in the \"Define\" phase, while mean \u00af\ud835\udcb3 and range R control charts followed by the estimates of process capability indices are adopted in the \"Measure\" phase.

Results on the recent publication trends in the field are reported in retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also conjecture what the future may hold for blind signal separation.","doi":"10.1049/cp:20080190","publicationTitle":"2008 IET International Conference on Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IET International Conference on Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4460810/4470048/04470127.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:20080190","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind source separation: trends of new age - a review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Blind source separation: trends of new age - a review","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2008","conferenceDate":"11-12 Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"10197804","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind source separation: trends of new age - a review","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"2008-Sangeeta-72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069385S","chronDate":"11-12 Jan. 2008","isNumber":"4470048","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4460810","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4470127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4470144,"authors":[{"name":"Jungwoo Joh","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jungwoo","lastName":"Joh","id":"37293971300"},{"name":"Jes\u00das A. del Alamo","affiliation":["Microsystems Technology Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jes\u00das A.","lastName":"del Alamo","id":"37273018300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"4470144","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":184,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3463},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Gallium nitride","HEMTs","MODFETs","Stress","Crystallography","Piezoelectric effect","Low voltage","Radio frequency","Material properties"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crystal defects","high electron mobility transistors","hot carriers","III-V semiconductors","piezoelectricity","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical degradation","GaN high-electron mobility transistors","critical drain-to-gate voltage","voltage biasing","electrical stress","degradation mechanism","crystallographic-defect formation","inverse piezoelectric effect","hot-electron mechanisms","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC stress","degradation","GaN","high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT)","reliability"]},{"kwd":["DC stress","degradation","GaN","high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT)","reliability"]}],"abstract":"We have found that there is a critical drain-to-gate voltage beyond which GaN high-electron mobility transistors start to degrade in electrical-stress experiments.

Each sensor collects a noise-corrupted version, performs a local quantization, and transmits a 1-bit message to an ally fusion center through a wireless medium where the sensor outputs are vulnerable to unauthorized observation from enemy/third-party fusion centers. In this paper, we introduce an encrypted wireless sensor network (eWSN) concept where stochastic enciphers operating on binary sensor outputs are introduced to disguise the sensor outputs, creating an eWSN scheme. Noting that the plaintext (original) and ciphertext (disguised) messages are constrained to a single bit due to bandwidth constraints, we consider a binary channel-like scheme to probabilistically encipher (i.e., flip) the sensor outputs. We first consider a symmetric key encryption case where the \"0\" and \"1\" enciphering probabilities are equal. The key is represented by the bit enciphering probability. Specifically, we derive the optimal estimator of the deterministic signal approached from a maximum-likelihood perspective and the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation problem utilizing the key. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the considered cryptosystem on enemy fusion centers that are unaware of the fact that the WSN is encrypted (i.e., we derive the bias, variance, and mean square error (MSE) of the enemy fusion center). We then extend the cryptosystem to admit unequal enciphering schemes for \"0\" and \"1\", and analyze the estimation problem from both the prospectives of ally (that has access to the enciphering keys) and (third-party) enemy fusion centers. The results show that when designed properly, a significant amount of bias and MSE can be introduced to an enemy fusion center with the cost to the ally fusion center being a marginal increase [factor of (1-Omega\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-Omega\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n )\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n, where 1-Omega\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</sub>\n, j=0, 1 is the \"j\" enciphering probability in the estimation variance (compared to the variance of a fusion center estimate operating in a vulnerable WSN).","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4522567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/4522567/04470151.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2008.919119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2008.919119","startPage":"273","endPage":"289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor Data Cryptography in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470151/","displayDocTitle":"Sensor Data Cryptography in Wireless Sensor Networks","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10076260","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor Data Cryptography in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"03tifs02-aysal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053119S","chronDate":"June  2008","isNumber":"4522567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"62","articleId":"4470151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4470204,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4489964/4470204/4470204-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Xu (S'07) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 2007, where he is pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.","His research interests include design and testing of mixed-technology microsystems, electronic design automation, mixed-signal VLSI design, MEMS modeling and simulation."]},"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37411446600"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4489964/4470204/4470204-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Krishnendu Chakrabarty (S'92\u2013M'96\u2013SM'00\u2013F'08) received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 1990, and the M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1992 and 1995, respectively, all in computer science and engineering.","He is currently Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University.

As chemists adapt more bioassays for concurrent execution on such ldquodigitalrdquo droplet-based microfluidic platforms, system integration, design complexity, and the need for defect tolerance are expected to increase rapidly. Automated design tools for defect-tolerant and multifunctional biochips are important for the emerging marketplace, especially for low-cost, portable, and disposable devices for clinical diagnostics. We present a unified synthesis method that combines defect-tolerant architectural synthesis with defect-aware physical design. The proposed approach allows architectural-level design choices and defect-tolerant physical design decisions to be made simultaneously. We use a large-scale protein assay and the polymerase chain reaction procedure as case studies to evaluate the proposed synthesis method. We also carry out simulations based on defect injection to evaluate the robustness of the synthesized biochip designs.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2008.918283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/4489964/04470204.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2008.918283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4489964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Defect-Aware High-Level Synthesis and Module Placement for Microfluidic Biochips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470204/","displayDocTitle":"Defect-Aware High-Level Synthesis and Module Placement for Microfluidic Biochips","volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9918408","pubMedId":"23852633","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4470204/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Defect-Aware High-Level Synthesis and Module Placement for Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"02tbcas01-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128756S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"4489964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4489964","articleId":"4470204","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4470227,"authors":[{"name":"Brett W.

We demonstrate these techniques on international trade data and the Enron email corpus to uncover latent components and their transient behavior. The mixture of roles assigned to individuals by ASALSAN showed strong correspondence with known job classifications and revealed the patterns of communication between these roles.

A predominant approach to collaborative filtering is neighborhood based (\"k-nearest neighbors\"), where a user-item preference rating is interpolated from ratings of similar items and/or users. We enhance the neighborhood-based approach leading to substantial improvement of prediction accuracy, without a meaningful increase in running time. First, we remove certain so-called \"global effects\" from the data to make the ratings more comparable, thereby improving interpolation accuracy. Second, we show how to simultaneously derive interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors, unlike previous approaches where each weight is computed separately. By globally solving a suitable optimization problem, this simultaneous interpolation accounts for the many interactions between neighbors leading to improved accuracy. Our method is very fast in practice, generating a prediction in about 0.2 milliseconds. Importantly, it does not require training many parameters or a lengthy preprocessing, making it very practical for large scale applications. Finally, we show how to apply these methods to the perceivably much slower user-oriented approach. To this end, we suggest a novel scheme for low dimensional embedding of the users. We evaluate these methods on the netflix dataset, where they deliver significantly better results than the commercial netflix cinematch recommender system.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2007.90","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470209/4470210/04470228.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2007.90","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470210","publicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","startPage":"43","endPage":"52","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Collaborative Filtering with Jointly Derived Neighborhood Interpolation Weights","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4470228/","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9894633","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470228/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Collaborative Filtering with Jointly Derived Neighborhood Interpolation Weights","confLoc":"Omaha, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"30180043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06103S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4470209","isNumber":"4470210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470209","citationCount":"204","xplore-issue":"4470210","articleId":"4470228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4470231,"authors":[{"name":"Deng Cai","affiliation":["UIUC, USA"],"firstName":"Deng","lastName":"Cai","id":"37411632000"},{"name":"Xiaofei He","affiliation":["Yahoo, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"He","id":"37407014800"},{"name":"Jiawei Han","affiliation":["UIUC, USA"],"firstName":"Jiawei","lastName":"Han","id":"37276626200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3018-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3018-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"4470231","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":142,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1069},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Regression: A Unified Approach for Sparse Subspace Learning","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470209/4470210/04470231.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2007.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470210","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2007.89","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Data mining","Information processing","Information retrieval","Pattern recognition","Helium","Clustering algorithms","Covariance matrix","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data reduction","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral regression","dimensionality reduction","information processing","data mining","information retrieval","pattern recognition","principal component analysis","linear discriminant analysis","locality preserving projection","learned projective functions","unified sparse subspace learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470231","abstract":"Recently the problem of dimensionality reduction (or, subspace learning) has received a lot of interests in many fields of information processing, including data mining, information retrieval, and pattern recognition.

However, a disadvantage of all these approaches is that the learned projective functions are linear combinations of all the original features, thus it is often difficult to interpret the results.

Somehow most existing work makes the implicit assumption that the training data and the yet-to-come testing data are always sampled from the \"same distribution\", and yet this \"same distribution\" evolves over time. We demonstrate that this may not be true, and one actually may never know either \"how\" or \"when\" the distribution changes. Thus, a model that fits well on the observed distribution can have unsatisfactory accuracy on the incoming data. Practically, one can just assume the bare minimum that learning from observed data is better than both random guessing and always predicting exactly the same class label. Importantly, we formally and experimentally demonstrate the robustness of a model averaging and simple voting-based framework for data streams, particularly when incoming data \"continuously follows significantly different\" distributions. On a real streaming data, this framework reduces the expected error of baseline models by 60%, and remains the most accurate compared to those baseline models.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2007.96","publicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470209/4470210/04470238.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2007.96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Appropriate Assumptions to Mine Data Streams: Analysis and Practice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","displayDocTitle":"On Appropriate Assumptions to Mine Data Streams: Analysis and Practice","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9894643","htmlLink":"/document/4470238/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2008","conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Appropriate Assumptions to Mine Data Streams: Analysis and Practice","confLoc":"Omaha, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"30180143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0939S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4470209","isNumber":"4470210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470209","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4470210","articleId":"4470238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4470244,"authors":[{"name":"Vasileios Kandylas","affiliation":["CIS Department, University of Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Kandylas","id":"37871856400"},{"name":"S.

An important subspace method is the Fisher-Rao linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which has been successfully applied in many fields such as biometrics, bioinformatics, and multimedia retrieval. However, LDA has a critical drawback: the projection to a subspace tends to merge those classes that are close together in the original feature space. If the separated classes are sampled from Gaussian distributions, all with identical covariance matrices, then LDA maximizes the mean value of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between the different classes. We generalize this point of view to obtain a framework for choosing a subspace by 1) generalizing the KL divergence to the Bregman divergence and 2) generalizing the arithmetic mean to a general mean. The framework is named the general averaged divergence analysis (GADA). Under this GADA framework, a geometric mean divergence analysis (GMDA) method based on the geometric mean is studied. A large number of experiments based on synthetic data show that our method significantly outperforms LDA and several representative LDA extensions.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2007.105","publicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470209/4470210/04470254.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2007.105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470210","startPage":"302","endPage":"311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Averaged Divergence Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"General Averaged Divergence Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470254/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9894659","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4470254/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Averaged Divergence Analysis","confLoc":"Omaha, NE, USA","sourcePdf":"30180302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060639S","chronDate":"28-31 Oct. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4470209","isNumber":"4470210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470209","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4470210","articleId":"4470254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4470256,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280027100"},{"name":"Venu Satuluri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Venu","lastName":"Satuluri","id":"38131604200"},{"name":"Srinivasan Parthasarathy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Srinivasan","lastName":"Parthasarathy","id":"37269057900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3018-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3018-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"4470256","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":126,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Social network services","Probability","Statistics","Prediction algorithms","Data mining","Chaos","Venus","Computer science","Data engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","very large databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["link prediction","social network analysis","local probabilistic graphical model method","semantic features","topological features"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Probabilistic Models for Link Prediction","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2007.108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470210","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470209/4470210/04470256.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2007.108","startPage":"322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470256","abstract":"One of the core tasks in social network analysis is to predict the formation of links (i.e. various types of relationships) over time.

Here we introduce a novel local probabilistic graphical model method that can scale to large graphs to estimate the joint co-occurrence probability of two nodes. Such a probability measure captures information that is not captured by either topological measures or measures of semantic similarity, which are the dominant measures used for link prediction.

In this paper, we extend the standard NMF to binary matrix factorization (BMF for short): given a binary matrix X, we want to factorize X into two binary matrices W, H (thus conserving the most important integer property of the objective matrix X) satisfying X ap WH. Two algorithms are studied and compared. These methods rely on a fundamental boundedness property of NMF which we propose and prove. This new property also provides a natural normalization scheme that eliminates the bias of factor matrices.

We solve this problem based on a neighborhood preservation principle - If the system is working normally, the neighborhood graph of each sensor is almost invariant against the fluctuations of experimental conditions.

In this study, we first show how the event records can be converted into a data set that is appropriate for running classification techniques. Then we apply classifiers on the data, including RIPPER (a rule-based classifier), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a traditional Nearest Neighbor method, and a customized Nearest Neighbor method. We show that the customized nearest neighbor approach can outperform RIPPER and SVMs in terms of both coverage and precision.

This paper presents topical n-grams, a topic model that discovers topics as well as topical phrases. The probabilistic model generates words in their textual order by, for each word, first sampling a topic, then sampling its status as a unigram or bigram, and then sampling the word from a topic-specific unigram or bigram distribution. Thus our model can model \"white house\" as a special meaning phrase in the 'politics' topic, but not in the 'real estate' topic. Successive bigrams form longer phrases.

The first approach detects faults with an optimal unknown input observer developed from a simplified energy balance model. Due to the time-consuming effort in developing a first principles model with motor power as the controlled variable, data-driven methods for fault detection are also investigated. Regression models that represent normal operating conditions (NOCs) are developed with both static and dynamic principal component analysis and partial least squares methods. The residual between process measurement and the NOC model prediction is used for fault detection. A hybrid approach, where a data-driven model is employed to derive an optimal unknown input observer, is also implemented. The three methods are evaluated with case studies on coal mill data, which includes a fault caused by a blocked inlet pipe. All three approaches detect the fault as it emerges. The optimal unknown input observer approach is most robust, in that, it has no false positives. On the other hand, the data-driven approaches are more straightforward to implement, since they just require the selection of appropriate confidence limit to avoid false detection. The proposed hybrid approach is promising for systems where a first principles model is cumbersome to obtain.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2007.914185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2007.914185","startPage":"659","endPage":"668","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4505383/04470327.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observer and Data-Driven-Model-Based Fault Detection in Power Plant Coal Mills","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","displayDocTitle":"Observer and Data-Driven-Model-Based Fault Detection in Power Plant Coal Mills","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4470327/","accessionNumber":"9944431","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470327/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observer and Data-Driven-Model-Based Fault Detection in Power Plant Coal Mills","sourcePdf":"23tec02-odgaard.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060596S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4505383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4505383","articleId":"4470327","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":4470351,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibin Liu","affiliation":["Economics and Management Department, North China Electric Power University, China"],"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37400635300"},{"name":"Li Bai","affiliation":["College of Economics and Trade, Agricultural University of Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Bai","id":"38122241700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3090-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3090-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4470351","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470351","abstract":"The agricultural information level is on the initial stage in China, so we should pay more attention to its construction, but how to measure the agricultural information degree is a major issue.

This approach differs dramatically from today's prevalent method of building HVAC controllers using multiple single-input-single-output control loops. A simulation model of an experimental HVAC system is used in the design and simulation testing of controllers. While simulation can be insightful, the only way to truly verify the performance provided by different HVAC controller designs is by actually using them to control an HVAC system. Thus, an experimental HVAC system was built for testing a wide range of advanced HVAC controllers. The design and testing of MIMO robust controllers provides valuable insight into potential improvements in performance, as well as constraints, associated with applying this control methodology to HVAC systems. Test results on the physical system demonstrate achievable performance gains (reductions in discharge air temperature settle time) in excess of 300%. Furthermore, these performance gains may be achieved without significant impact to current HVAC system architecture (interconnection).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Robust Control for HVAC Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2007.903392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/4492807/04470488.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2007.903392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Robust Control for HVAC Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4470488/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921508","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Robust Control for HVAC Systems","sourcePdf":"16tcst03-anderson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104627S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4492807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4492807","articleId":"4470488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4470489,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00c9 Raul Azinheira","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jos\u00c9 Raul","lastName":"Azinheira","id":"37283594200"},{"name":"Alexandra Moutinho","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Moutinho","id":"37549541600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"4470489","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":122,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2127},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470489","abstract":"This brief presents a backstepping-based controller with input saturations, applicable for the hover flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A dynamic model for a generic UAV is introduced that is valid for quasi-stationary conditions, with quaternion formulation of the kinematics equations. Based on this model, a backstepping design formulation is deduced for UAV hover control, and its global asymptotic stability is demonstrated. In order to cope with limitations due to reduced actuation, saturations are introduced in the control design, and the stability of the modified control solution is verified. Simulation results are presented for the hover stabilization of an airship UAV, which are demonstrative of the excellent performance of the proposed controller and illustrate its robustness in face of wind disturbances.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2007.908209","startPage":"517","endPage":"526","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/4492807/04470489.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2007.908209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hover Control of an UAV With Backstepping Design Including Input Saturations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Backstepping","Vehicle dynamics","Automatic control","Aerodynamics","Control design","Robust control","Helicopters","Kinematics","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","asymptotic stability","control system synthesis","remotely operated vehicles","space vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backstepping-based controller design","input saturation","hover flight control","unmanned aerial vehicle","quasi stationary condition","kinematics equation","quaternion formulation","asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backstepping","input saturations","nonlinear control","stabilization","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"Hover Control of an UAV With Backstepping Design Including Input Saturations","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4470489/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921510","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hover Control of an UAV With Backstepping Design Including Input Saturations","sourcePdf":"16tcst03-azinheira.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0586S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4492807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"4492807","articleId":"4470489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":4470490,"authors":[{"name":"Karel Hinnen","affiliation":["Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Karel","lastName":"Hinnen","id":"38132720500"},{"name":"Michel Verhaegen","affiliation":["Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Verhaegen","id":"37271386700"},{"name":"Niek Doelman","affiliation":["TNO Science and Industry, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Niek","lastName":"Doelman","id":"37546958300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"4470490","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":478},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470490","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric waves","Control design","Adaptive optics","Telescopes","Control systems","Optical distortion","Atmosphere","Atmospheric modeling","Mirrors","Propagation delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive optics","astronomical telescopes","atmospheric optics","atmospheric turbulence","control system synthesis","Hinfin control","open loop systems","optical control","spatiotemporal phenomena","wavefront sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven H2-optimal control design approach","adaptive optics","ground-based astronomical telescopes","atmospheric turbulence model","AO systems","spatio-temporal correlation","subspace-identification algorithm","open-loop wavefront sensor data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive optics (AO)","data-driven disturbance modeling","optimal control","stochastic identification"]}],"abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> Adaptive optics (AO) is used in ground-based astronomical telescopes to improve the resolution by counteracting the effects of atmospheric turbulence. Most AO systems are based on a simple control law that neglects the temporal evolution of the distortions introduced by the atmosphere. This paper presents a data-driven control design approach that is able to exploit the spatio-temporal correlation in the wavefront, without assuming any form of decoupling. The approach consists of a dedicated subspace-identification algorithm to identify an atmospheric disturbance model from open-loop wavefront sensor data, followed by <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>${\\cal H}_{2}$</tex></formula>-optimal control design. It is shown that in the case that the deformable mirror and wavefront sensor dynamics can be represented by a delay and a two taps impulse response, it is possible to derive an analytical expression for the <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>${\\cal H}_{2}$</tex></formula>-optimal controller.

In this approach a systolic array for low-level image processing is considered. The architecture is customizable providing the possibility of performing window operations with masks of variable size and every processing element in the array can be configured according to a control word. The architecture comprises a scheme to reduce the number of accesses to data memory and router elements to handle data movement among different structures inside the same architecture, these components add the possibility of chaining interconnection of multiple processing blocks. In order to turn the architecture into a real platform, support has been provided to the motion estimation algorithm which presents higher complexity.

However, the large-scale integration of wind power represents a challenge for power system operations planning because wind power 1) cannot be dispatched in the classical sense; and 2) its output varies as weather conditions change. This warrants the investigation of alternative short-term power system operations planning methods capable of better coping with the nature of wind generation while maintaining or even improving the current reliability and economic performance of power systems. To this end, this paper formulates a short-term forward electricity market-clearing problem with stochastic security capable of accounting for nondispatchable and variable wind power generation sources. The principal benefit of this stochastic operation planning approach is that, when compared to a deterministic worst-case scenario planning philosophy, it allows greater wind power penetration without sacrificing security.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Security for Operations Planning With Significant Wind Power Generation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4494587/04470561.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Security for Operations Planning With Significant Wind Power Generation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4470561/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922133","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Security for Operations Planning With Significant Wind Power Generation","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs02-bouffard.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089784S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4494587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"498","xplore-issue":"4494587","articleId":"4470561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4470568,"authors":[{"name":"Renato Negra","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Negra","id":"37275858200"},{"name":"Alexandre Sadeve","affiliation":["IXL Microelectronics Laboratory, Bordeaux University, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Sadeve","id":"38559726300"},{"name":"Souheil Bensmida","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Souheil","lastName":"Bensmida","id":"37400445200"},{"name":"Fadhel M.

This paper reports the design of a multiharmonic dual-band Class-F power amplifier for applications at wireless communication frequencies based on a switchless multiharmonic multiband load coupling network topology. The proposed output network topology is able to precisely synthesize Class-F impedance conditions with up to three harmonics at two distinct nonharmonic frequencies without the need of switches or electronically tunable elements. The proposed topology was used to design a Class-F PA in hybrid technology for the frequency bands at 1.7 and 2.14 GHz. Optimum impedances for maximum efficiency of the used GaAs MESFET for the two bands were determined by multiharmonic load-pull measurements and synthesized by the proposed switchless dual-band Class-F network. With a dual-band input matching network, the fabricated PA achieves 44.0% and 61.3% drain efficiency for an output power of more than 32.8 dbm and 34.4 dbm at 1.7 and 2.14 GHz, respectively.

Among all the MPPT strategies, the incremental conductance (INC) algorithm is widely used due to the high tracking accuracy at steady state and good adaptability to the rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. In this paper, a modified variable step size INC MPPT algorithm is proposed, which automatically adjusts the step size to track the PV array maximum power point. Compared with the conventional fixed step size method, the proposed approach can effectively improve the MPPT speed and accuracy simultaneously. Furthermore, it is simple and can be easily implemented in digital signal processors.

Training the neural network inverse model directly may become difficult due to the nonuniqueness of the input-output relationship in the inverse model. We propose a new method to solve such a problem by detecting multivalued solutions in training data. The data containing multivalued solutions are divided into groups according to derivative information using a neural network forward model such that individual groups do not have the problem of multivalued solutions. Multiple inverse models are built based on divided data groups, and are then combined to form a complete model. A comprehensive modeling methodology is proposed, which includes direct inverse modeling, segmentation, derivative division, and model combining techniques. The methodology is applied to waveguide filter modeling and more accurate results are achieved compared to the direct neural network inverse modeling method.

The paper concentrates on the operation and modeling of stand-alone power systems with PV power generators. Systems with PV array-inverter assemblies, operating in the slave-and-master modes, are discussed, and the simulation results obtained using a renewable energy power system modular simulator are presented. These results demonstrate that simulation is an essential step in the system development process and that PV power generators constitute a valuable energy source. They have the ability to balance the energy and supply good power quality. It is demonstrated that when PV array- inverters are operating in the master mode in stand-alone applications, they well perform the task of controlling the voltage and frequency of the power system. The mechanism of switching the master function between the diesel generator and the PV array-inverter assembly in a stand-alone power system is also proposed and analyzed. Finally, some experimental results on a practical system are compared to the simulation results and confirm the usefulness of the proposed approach to the development of renewable energy systems with PV power generators.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.920583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4550662/04470592.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.920583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550662","startPage":"2752","endPage":"2758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Renewable Energy Systems With Photovoltaic Power Generators: Operation and Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Renewable Energy Systems With Photovoltaic Power Generators: Operation and Modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470592/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10074556","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4470592/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Renewable Energy Systems With Photovoltaic Power Generators: Operation and Modeling","sourcePdf":"55tie07-bialasiewicz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044579S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4550662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"274","xplore-issue":"4550662","articleId":"4470592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4470593,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Bianchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4505400/4470593/4470593-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicola Bianchi (M'98) received the Laurea and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 1991 and 1995, respectively.","Since 1998, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, as a Senior Research Assistant in the Electric Drives Laboratory.

Proper current control strategies are adopted so as to guarantee safe drive operation after any fault occurrence. This paper covers three fault types: the open circuit condition of a single phase, the open circuit condition of two nonadjacent phases, and the open circuit condition of two adjacent phases. Two motors with two different windings (with double and single layers, respectively) are compared under each fault type. This paper aims to highlight the difference in the motor performance of motors adopting these two different windings. A further novelty of this paper is that the proper current control strategies are derived analytically, including not only the fundamental harmonic of the flux-density distribution but also the higher harmonics. It is shown that these harmonics cause high torque oscillations. Owing to this analytical approach, the strategy can be applied to a variety of PM motors. In addition, the postfault current waveforms remain sinusoidal, making the current control easier. For each fault type, the results of both simulations and experimental tests are included. A good match between analytical predictions and experimental tests validates the proposed current control strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.920645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4505400/04470593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.920645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4505400","startPage":"1978","endPage":"1987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Stator Winding of a Five-Phase Permanent-Magnet Motor on Postfault Operations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4470593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Stator Winding of a Five-Phase Permanent-Magnet Motor on Postfault Operations","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4470593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9960752","dateOfInsertion":"30 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4470593/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Stator Winding of a Five-Phase Permanent-Magnet Motor on Postfault Operations","sourcePdf":"55tie05-bianchi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068387S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4505400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"4505400","articleId":"4470593","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4471210,"authors":[{"name":"Suman Dwari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4505400/4471210/4471210-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Suman Dwari (S'05) received the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, in 2003.

It incorporates a quadratic penalization term in the design of spectral matched filters in order to restrict the possible matched filters (models) to a subset which are more stable and have better performance than the non-regularized adaptive spectral matched filters. The effect of regularization depends on the form of the regularization term and the amount of regularization which is controlled by a parameter so-called the regularization coefficient. In this letter, the sum-of-squares of the filter coefficients is used as the regularization term, and different values for the regularization coefficient are tested. A Bayesian-based derivation of the regularized matched filter is also described which provides a procedure for choosing the regularization coefficient. Experimental results for detecting targets in hyperspectral imagery are presented for regularized and non-regularized spectral matched filters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04471813.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2008.917805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2008.917805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized Spectral Matched Filter for Target Recognition in Hyperspectral Imagery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Target recognition","Hyperspectral imaging","Covariance matrix","Testing","Object detection","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Bayesian methods","Image recognition","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","filtering theory","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regularized spectral matched filter","target recognition","hyperspectral imagery","quadratic penalization term","regularization coefficient","sum-of-squares","filter coefficients","Bayesian-based derivation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic target detection","hyperspectral imagery","matched filter","regularization","regularized spectral matched filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Regularized Spectral Matched Filter for Target Recognition in Hyperspectral Imagery","volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/4471813/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"9920205","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized Spectral Matched Filter for Target Recognition in Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-nasrabadi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045401S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4471813","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4471829,"authors":[{"name":"Taiping Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4471815/4471829/4471829-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taiping Zhang (S'07) received the B.

We derive the TPNMF model from original NMF algorithm by preserving local topology structure. The TPNMF is based on minimizing the constraint gradient distance in the high-dimensional space. Compared with L\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n distance, the gradient distance is able to reveal latent manifold structure of face patterns. By using TPNMF decomposition, the high-dimensional face space is transformed into a local topology preserving subspace for face recognition. In comparison with PCA, LDA, and original NMF, which search only the Euclidean structure of face space, the proposed TPNMF finds an embedding that preserves local topology information, such as edges and texture. Theoretical analysis and derivation given also validate the property of TPNMF. Experimental results on three different databases, containing more than 12 000 face images under varying in lighting, facial expression, and pose, show that the proposed TPNMF approach provides a better representation of face patterns and achieves higher recognition rates than NMF.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4471815/04471829.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.918957","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.918957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology Preserving Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Vectors","Image databases","Pattern recognition","Image recognition","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["topology preserving non-negative matrix factorization","face recognition","local topology structure","Euclidean structure","face patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","manifold structure","non-negative matrix factorization","topology preserving"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Biometry","Face","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Topology Preserving Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Face Recognition","volume":"17","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4471829/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920155","pubMedId":"18390365","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Preserving Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"17tip04-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070709S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4471815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"4471815","articleId":"4471829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4471835,"authors":[{"name":"Chengyu Cao","affiliation":["Aerospace and Ocean Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Chengyu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37287632200"},{"name":"Naira Hovakimyan","affiliation":["Aerospace and Ocean Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Naira","lastName":"Hovakimyan","id":"37299175600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4471835","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":248,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1940},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel adaptive control architecture that adapts fast and ensures uniformly bounded transient response for system's both signals, input and output, simultaneously.

Under the mild assumption that the signs of the leading minors of the control input gain matrix are known, the controller yields locally uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) tracking while compensating for unstructured uncertainty in both the drift vector and the input matrix. First, a full-state feedback controller is designed based on limited assumptions on the structure of the system nonlinearities, and the singularity-free controller is proven to yield locally UUB tracking through a Lyapunov-based analysis. Then, it is shown that an output feedback control can be designed based on a high-gain observer.

The sensors, due to bandwidth constraints, provide binary representatives of a noise-corrupted source parameter. Recently, proposed decentralized, distributed estimation, and power scheduling methods do no consider errors occurring during the transmission of binary observations from the sensors to fusion center. In this paper, we extend the decentralized estimation model to the case where imperfect transmission channels are considered. The proposed estimator, which operates on additive channel noise corrupted versions of quantized noisy sensor observations, is approached from maximum likelihood (ML) perspective. The resulting ML estimate is a root, in the region of interest (ROI), of a derivative polynomial function. We analyze the natural logarithm of the polynomial within the ROI showing that the function is log-concave, thereby indicating that numerical methods, such as Newton's algorithm, can be utilized to obtain the optimal solution. Due to complexity and implementation issues associated with the numerical methods, we derive and analyze simpler suboptimal solutions, i.e., the two-stage and mean estimators. The two-stage estimator first estimates the binary observations from noisy fusion center observations utilizing a threshold operation, followed by an estimate of the source parameter. The optimal threshold is the maximum a posteriori (MAP) detector for binary detection and minimizes the probability of binary observation estimation error. Optimal threshold expressions for commonly utilized light-(Gaussian) and heavy-tailed (Cauchy) channel noise models are derived. The mean estimator simply averages the noisy fusion center observations. The output variances of means of the proposed suboptimal estimators are derived. In addition, a computational complexity analysis is presented comparing the proposed ML optimal and suboptimal two-stage and mean estimators. Numerical examples evaluating and comparing the performance of proposed ML, two-stage and mean estimators are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.909006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471869","startPage":"1398","endPage":"1410","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4471869/04471870.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.909006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained Decentralized Estimation Over Noisy Channels for Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood estimation","Additive noise","Sensor fusion","Polynomials","Bandwidth","Maximum likelihood detection","Algorithm design and analysis","Detectors","Estimation error","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","maximum likelihood estimation","sensor fusion","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained decentralized estimation","noisy channel","sensor network","fusion center","maximum likelihood estimation","maximum aposteriori detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","parameter estimation","sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Constrained Decentralized Estimation Over Noisy Channels for Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4471870/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9918728","publicationDate":"April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained Decentralized Estimation Over Noisy Channels for Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"56tsp04-aysal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08551S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4471869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4471869","articleId":"4471870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4471871,"authors":[{"name":"R\u00c9my Boyer","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris XI, CNRS-LSS-Sup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"p":["R\u00e9my Boyer received the M.

To exploit this information, standard methods are based on the orthogonal projection of the steering manifold onto the noise subspace associated with the a priori known DOA. In this paper, we derive and analyze the Cramer-Rao bound associated with this model and in particular we point out the limitations of this approach when the known and unknown DOA are closely spaced and the associated sources are uncorrelated (block-diagonal source covariance). To fill this need, we propose to integrate a priori known locations of several sources into the MUSIC algorithm based on oblique projection of the steering manifold. Finally, we show that the proposed approach is able to almost completely cancel the influence of the known DOA on the unknown ones for block-diagonal source covariance and for sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4471869/04471871.pdf","startPage":"1374","endPage":"1387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.909348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.909348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oblique Projections for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation With Prior Knowledge","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Multiple signal classification","Sensor arrays","Position measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Passive radar","Sonar","Seismology","Radar applications","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance analysis","direction-of-arrival estimation","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","steering manifold orthogonal projection","Cramer-Rao bound","block-diagonal source covariance","MUSIC algorithm","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cram\u00c9r-Rao bound","MUSIC algorithm","orthogonal and oblique projectors","prior knowledge of DOA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Oblique Projections for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation With Prior Knowledge","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4471871/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918729","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oblique Projections for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation With Prior Knowledge","sourcePdf":"56tsp04-boyer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109417S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4471869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4471869","articleId":"4471871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4471872,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Sara Cacciapuoti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4471869/4471872/4471872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Angela Sara Cacciapuoti was born in Pozzuoli, Italy, on August 19, 1980.

This paper considers the blind (semiblind) maximum-likelihood (ML) detection problem of OSTBC-OFDM with a single OSTBC-OFDM block only. The merit of such an investigation is the ability to accommodate channels with shorter coherence time. We examine both the implementation and identifiability issues, with a focus on BPSK or QPSK constellations. In the implementation, we propose reduced-complexity detection schemes using subchannel grouping. In the identifiability analysis, we show that the proposed schemes can ensure a probability one identifiability condition using very few number of pilots. For example, the proposed semiblind detection scheme only requires a single pilot code for unique data identification; while the conventional pilot-based channel estimation method requires L pilots where L denotes the channel length. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can provide performance close to that of their nonblind counterparts.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.909229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4471869/04471873.pdf","startPage":"1637","endPage":"1649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.909229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Detection of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coded OFDM in Unknown Block Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471873/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-Likelihood Detection of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coded OFDM in Unknown Block Fading Channels","volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918731","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4471873/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-Likelihood Detection of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coded OFDM in Unknown Block Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tsp04-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103766S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4471869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4471869","articleId":"4471873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4471877,"authors":[{"name":"Slobodan Djukanovic","affiliation":["Elektrotehni\u010dki fakultet, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4471869/4471877/4471877-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Slobodan Djukanovi\u0107 (S'07) was born in Valjevo, Serbia and Montenegro, in 1976.

The conventional (suboptimal) and the optimal LPFT receiver performances are compared by means of simulations carried out on the received signal corrupted by different FM types of interferences.

Starting from the data projection method (DPM), which constitutes a simple and reliable means for adaptively estimating and tracking subspaces, we develop a fast and numerically robust implementation of DPM, which comes at a considerably lower computational cost. Most existing schemes track subspaces corresponding either to the largest or to the smallest singular values, while our DPM version can switch from one subspace type to the other with a simple change of sign of its single parameter. The proposed algorithm provides orthonormal vector estimates of the subspace basis that are numerically stable since they do not accumulate roundoff errors. In fact, our scheme constitutes the first numerically stable, low complexity, algorithm for tracking subspaces corresponding to the smallest singular values. Regarding convergence towards orthonormality our scheme exhibits the fastest speed among all other subspace tracking algorithms of similar complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4471869/04471878.pdf","startPage":"1452","endPage":"1465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.909335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.909335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Stable Subspace Tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Signal processing algorithms","Vectors","Switches","Convergence","Matrix decomposition","Robustness","Computational efficiency","Roundoff errors","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","numerical stability","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive subspace tracking algorithms","data projection method","orthonormal vector estimates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast adaptive algorithms","numerically stable subspace tracking","orthogonal iteration","subspace tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Stable Subspace Tracking","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4471878/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918737","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Stable Subspace Tracking","sourcePdf":"56tsp04-doukopoulos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088418S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4471869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4471869","articleId":"4471878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4471881,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Hoshyar","affiliation":["Mobile Communication Research Group, University of Surrey, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4471869/4471881/4471881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Hoshyar (M'03) received the B.S. degree in communications engineering and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, both in mobile communications, from Tehran University, Tehran, Iran, in 1991, 1996, and 2001, respectively.

Approximating the optimal filter estimate by particle filter methods has become perhaps the most common and useful method in recent years. Many variants of particle filters have been suggested, and there is an extensive literature on the theoretical aspects of the quality of the approximation. Still a clear-cut result that the approximate solution, for unbounded functions, converges to the true optimal estimate as the number of particles tends to infinity seems to be lacking. It is the purpose of this contribution to give such a basic convergence result for a rather general class of unbounded functions. Furthermore, a general framework, including many of the particle filter algorithms as special cases, is given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9918741","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4471882/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Basic Convergence Result for Particle Filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Basic Convergence Result for Particle Filtering","sourcePdf":"56tsp04-hu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073211S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4471869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4471869","articleId":"4471882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":4471885,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Jean Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4471869/4471885/4471885-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung-Jean Kim (M'02) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.","Since 2002, he has been with the Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, where he is currently a Consulting Assistant Professor.

Robust beamforming attempts to systematically alleviate this sensitivity by explicitly incorporating a data uncertainty model in the optimization problem. In this paper, we consider robust beamforming via worst-case SINR maximization, that is, the problem of finding a weight vector that maximizes the worst-case SINR over the uncertainty model. We show that with a general convex uncertainty model, the worst-case SINR maximization problem can be solved by using convex optimization. In particular, when the uncertainty model can be represented by linear matrix inequalities, the worst-case SINR maximization problem can be solved via semidefinite programming. The convex formulation result allows us to handle more general uncertainty models than prior work using a special form of uncertainty model. We illustrate the method with a numerical example.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Beamforming via Worst-Case SINR Maximization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.911498","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4471869/04471885.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.911498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust Beamforming via Worst-Case SINR Maximization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4471885/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918744","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Beamforming via Worst-Case SINR Maximization","sourcePdf":"56tsp04-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140059S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4471869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4471869","articleId":"4471885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4471886,"authors":[{"name":"Yue M.

The directionality of the spectral partitioning makes these filter banks useful in separating the directional information in multidimensional signals. Despite the existence of various design techniques proposed for the 2-D case, to our best knowledge, the design of hourglass filter banks in 3-D and higher dimensions with finite impulse response (FIR) filters and perfect reconstruction has not been previously reported. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based design for the hourglass filter banks in arbitrary dimensions, featuring perfect reconstruction, FIR filters, efficient implementation using lifting/ladder structures, and a near-tight frame construction. The effectiveness of the proposed mapping- based design depends on the study of a set of conditions on the frequency supports of the mapping kernels. These conditions ensure that we can still get good frequency responses when the component filters used are nonideal. Among all feasible choices, we then propose an optimal specification for the mapping kernels, which leads to the simplest passband shapes and involves the fewest number of frequency variables. Finally, we illustrate the proposed techniques by a design example in 3-D, and an application in video denoising.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.909340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4471869/04471886.pdf","startPage":"1466","endPage":"1478","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.909340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mapping-Based Design for Nonsubsampled Hourglass Filter Banks in Arbitrary Dimensions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Mapping-Based Design for Nonsubsampled Hourglass Filter Banks in Arbitrary Dimensions","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4471886/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918746","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471886/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mapping-Based Design for Nonsubsampled Hourglass Filter Banks in Arbitrary Dimensions","sourcePdf":"56tsp04-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114537S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4471869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4471869","articleId":"4471886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4471889,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Puschel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4471869/4471889/4471889-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Markus P\u00fcschel (M'99\u2013SM'05) received the Diploma (M.

Application to the 16 discrete cosine and sine transforms yields a large class of fast general radix algorithms, many of which have not been found before.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.907919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4471869/04471889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.907919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471869","startPage":"1502","endPage":"1521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Signal Processing Theory: Cooley\u2013Tukey Type Algorithms for DCTs and DSTs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Signal Processing Theory: Cooley\u2013Tukey Type Algorithms for DCTs and DSTs","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918754","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4471889/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Signal Processing Theory: Cooley\u2013Tukey Type Algorithms for DCTs and DSTs","sourcePdf":"56tsp04-puschel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135265S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4471869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4471869","articleId":"4471889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4471892,"authors":[{"name":"Gesualdo Scutari","affiliation":["Department of INFOCOM, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4471869/4471892/4471892-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gesualdo Scutari (S'01\u2013M'06) received the electrical engineering and Ph.D. degrees from University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza,\u201d Rome, Italy, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","During 2003, he held a visiting research appointment at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, and during 2007, he was a visiting researcher at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong.

We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the proposed system to reach a consensus on globally optimal decision statistics. One of the major results proved in this work is that a consensus is reached with exponential convergence speed for any bounded delay condition if and only if the directed graph is quasi-strongly connected. We provide a closed form expression for the global consensus, showing that the effect of delays is, in general, the introduction of a bias in the final decision. Finally, we exploit our closed form expression to devise a double-step consensus mechanism able to provide an unbiased estimate with minimum extra complexity, without the need to know or estimate the channel parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.909377","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4471869/04471892.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.909377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Decision Through Self-Synchronizing Sensor Networks in the Presence of Propagation Delays and Asymmetric Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Decision Through Self-Synchronizing Sensor Networks in the Presence of Propagation Delays and Asymmetric Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471892/","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4471892/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918758","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Decision Through Self-Synchronizing Sensor Networks in the Presence of Propagation Delays and Asymmetric Channels","sourcePdf":"56tsp04-scutari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12147S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4471869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"4471869","articleId":"4471892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4471893,"authors":[{"name":"Ba-Tuong Vo","affiliation":["Western Australian Telecommunic Research Institute, University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4471869/4471893/4471893-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ba-Tuong Vo was born in Perth, Australia, 1982.

The designed adaptive controllers possess a linear parameter structure, guarantee global boundedness of the closed-loop system as well as tracking of a given trajectory within any prescribed accuracy. Our design approach takes advantage of a Lipschitzian property with respect to the plant nonlinear parameters. The outcome is that a very broad class of nonlinearly parameterized adaptive control problems for robot manipulators can be solved using this technique. Another feature of the proposed method is the design of low-dimensional estimator, even 1-D if desired, independently of the unknown parameter vector dimension. Simulations and experiments in friction compensation task for low-velocity tracking of a 2 degree-of-freedom planar robot demonstrate the viability of the technique and emphasize its advantages relatively to more classical approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9921518","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4471896/","publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Control for Nonlinearly Parameterized Uncertainties in Robot Manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Control for Nonlinearly Parameterized Uncertainties in Robot Manipulators","sourcePdf":"16tcst03-hung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089757S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4492807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4492807","articleId":"4471896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4471901,"authors":[{"name":"Yinyin Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4531603/4471901/4471901-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yinyin Liu received the B.S. degree in information science and engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2001, and the M.S. degree in aerospace engineering from Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, in 2003.

The optimized approximation algorithm avoids overfitting by means of a novel and effective stopping criterion based on the estimation of the signal-to-noise-ratio figure (SNRF). Using SNRF, which checks the goodness-of-fit in the approximation, overfitting can be automatically detected from the training error only without use of a separate validation set. The algorithm has been applied to problems of optimizing the number of hidden neurons in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and optimizing the number of learning epochs in MLP's backpropagation training using both synthetic and benchmark data sets. The OAA algorithm can also be utilized in the optimization of other parameters of NNs. In addition, it can be applied to the problem of function approximation using any kind of basis functions, or to the problem of learning model selection when overfitting needs to be considered.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.915114","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4531603/04471901.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.915114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4531603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"983","endPage":"995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimized Approximation Algorithm in Neural Networks Without Overfitting","volume":"19","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4471901/","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9999724","pubMedId":"18541499","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Approximation Algorithm in Neural Networks Without Overfitting","sourcePdf":"19tnn06-yliu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104149S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4531603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"4531603","articleId":"4471901","onlineDate":"14 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4471902,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Technology Center of New Jersey, WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/4522567/4471902/4471902-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Zhang (S'07) received the B.S. and the M.E. degrees from the School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB) and Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ.","Her research interests include network security, secure localization, and wireless application and services."]},"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405805200"},{"name":"Zang Li","affiliation":["Technology Center of New Jersey, WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/4522567/4471902/4471902-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Zang Li (S'05) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Rutgers University in 2005, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB).","Her research interests include wireless security, wireless networking, information theory and coding, and multimedia security."]},"firstName":"Zang","lastName":"Li","id":"37421720200"},{"name":"Wade Trappe","affiliation":["Technology Center of New Jersey, WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/4522567/4471902/4471902-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Wade Trappe (S'98\u2013M'02) received the B.A. degree in mathematics from The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics and scientific computing from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2002.","Currently, he is an Associate Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rutgers University, and is Associate Director of the Wireless Information Network Laboratory (WINLAB), Piscataway, NJ.

In this paper, we adapt the classical challenge-response method for authentication to the task of verifying an entity's location. Our scheme utilizes a collection of transmitters, and adapts the power allocations across these transmitters to verify a user's claimed location. This strategy, which we call a power-modulated challenge response, is able to be used with existing. wireless sensor networks. First, we propose a direct method, where some transmitters are selected to send ldquochallengesrdquo that the claimant node should be able to witness based on its claimed location, and for which the claimant node must correctly respond to in order to prove its location. Second, we reverse the strategy by presenting an indirect method, where some transmitters send challenges that the claimant node should not be able to witness. Then, we present a signal-strength-based method, where the node responds with its received signal strength and thereby provides improved location verification. To evaluate our schemes, we examine different adversarial models for the claimant, and characterize the performance of our power-modulated challenge response schemes under these adversarial models. Further, we propose a new localization attack, where a set of nodes collaborates to pretend that there is a node at the claimed location. This collusion attack can do tremendous harm to localization and the performance of the aforementined methods under collusion attack are explained. Finally, we propose the use of a rotational directional power-modulated challenge response, where directional antennas are used to defend against collusion attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 May 2008","volume":"3","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10076269","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4471902/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Localization Attacks on Power-Modulated Challenge\u2013Response Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Localization Attacks on Power-Modulated Challenge\u2013Response Systems","sourcePdf":"03tifs02-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084998S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4522567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4522567","articleId":"4471902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4471922,"authors":[{"name":"Hanqing Lou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, USA"],"firstName":"Hanqing","lastName":"Lou","id":"37266768100"},{"name":"Javier Garcia-Frias","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, USA"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Garcia-Frias","id":"38274987800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4471922","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We propose a family of rate-compatible codes based on the concatenation of two linear codes with low-density generator matrix, which are a special class of LDPC codes with low encoding complexity.

In this paper, we first offer code design guidelines in terms of source- channel coding for algebraic binning. We then address practical code design based on nested lattice codes and propose nested turbo codes using turbo-like trellis-coded quantization (TCQ) for source coding and turbo trellis-coded modulation (TTCM) for channel coding. Compared to TCQ, turbo-like TCQ offers structural similarity between the source and channel coding components, leading to more efficient nesting with TTCM and better source coding performance. Due to the difference in effective dimensionality between turbo-like TCQ and TTCM, there is a performance tradeoff between these two components when they are nested together, meaning that the performance of turbo-like TCQ worsens as the TTCM code becomes stronger and vice versa. Optimization of this performance tradeoff leads to our code design that outperforms existing TCQ/TCM and TCQ/TTCM constructions and exhibits a gap of 0.94, 1.42 and 2.65 dB to the Costa capacity at 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 bits/sample, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nested turbo codes for the Costa problem","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4471920/04471934.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.050101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Nested turbo codes for the Costa problem","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4471934/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9919954","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nested turbo codes for the Costa problem","sourcePdf":"tc_0803_388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125754S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4471920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4471920","articleId":"4471934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4471935,"authors":[{"name":"Mina Sartipi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, Chattanooga, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4471920/4471935/4471935-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mina Sartipi earned her B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

In particular, since we are interested in wireless sensor network applications, we consider LDPC codes with short to moderate lengths that achieve every arbitrary coding rate on the Slepian-Wolf rate region. We simplify the distributed source coding problem to the rate-compatible LDPC code design with an unequal error protection property. The decoders communicate to each other to exchange information bits prior to decoding. However, thereafter, each performs the decoding independently. Therefore, errors in one decoder do not affect the other one. The simulation results confirm that the gap from the theoretical limit remains almost the same for different rates on the Slepian-Wolf rate region. First, we consider two correlated sources. We show that our proposed scheme improves the performance of distributed source coding of two sources considerably. This benefit is more stressed for application with short to moderate length sequences. Then, we study distributed source coding of three sources. As a special case, we investigate three sources that are pairwise correlated with the same correlation probability. We show that the gap from the theoretical limit is smaller than that of previous work. We also investigate the distributed source coding of correlated sources when there is no prior knowledge of the correlation parameter at the time of code design. We note that although the proposed distributed source coding is well suited for sensor networks (where sequences with less than 10000 bits are used), the method can be generalized to other distributed source coding applications.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060006","startPage":"400","endPage":"411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4471920/04471935.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed source coding using short to moderate length rate-compatible LDPC codes: the entire Slepian-Wolf rate region","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed source coding using short to moderate length rate-compatible LDPC codes: the entire Slepian-Wolf rate region","volume":"56","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9919955","publicationDate":"March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4471935/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed source coding using short to moderate length rate-compatible LDPC codes: the entire Slepian-Wolf rate region","sourcePdf":"tc_0803_400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126527S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4471920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4471920","articleId":"4471935","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4471936,"authors":[{"name":"Jittra Jootar","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4471920/4471936/4471936-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jittra Jootar was born in Nashville, TN.

In order to describe realistic performance issues, we assume that the channel estimates are calculated from linear filters using noisy pilot symbols. We also assume non-quasi- static channels, spatially correlated transmit antennas and finite- depth interleaving. Two types of receivers are investigated for the Alamouti STC, namely, the linear-combining space-time decoder (LC-STD) and the maximum-likelihood space-time decoder (ML- STD). Two types of receivers are investigated for the concatenated system, namely, the LC-STD with the ML convolutional decoder and the joint Alamouti and convolutional ML decoder. The results have shown that the LC-STD is more sensitive to the Doppler spread than the ML-STD. However, since the ML- STD is very sensitive to the channel estimation error, the gains provided by the decoder in fast fading channels will be offset unless an optimized channel estimator is employed. Performance comparisons between the Alamouti systems and the SISO systems indicate that, when the system environment is not ideal, the SISO systems may outperform the Alamouti systems.

A cyclically equal-spaced, equal-energy interleaved pilot preamble is proposed by which two iterative estimators are developed. In the first estimator, we develop a modified SAGE (space alternating generalized expectation-maximization) method by incorporating multiuser interference cancellation in both time and frequency domains into the SAGE method. The proposed modified SAGE method yields a faster convergence rate, a better estimation performance, and a lower complexity than the existing conventional SAGE method from [10]. In the second method, we propose a very low complexity ad hoc method to replace the high complexity frequency offset estimator of the first method. The proposed ad hoc method is developed based on the time-domain characteristics of the pilot preamble and the frequency-domain power concentration property of OFDMA systems. It achieves almost the same estimation performance as the first proposed method but requires significantly lower complexity. Both proposed methods are not only better in estimation performance, convergence rate, and complexity, but also more robust to the number of active uplink users than the existing method while requiring only one OFDM training symbol and no restriction of the data subcarrier assignment scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4471920/04471942.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"484","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two novel iterative joint frequency-offset and channel estimation methods for OFDMA uplink","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative methods","Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","Convergence","Interference cancellation","Frequency domain analysis","Yield estimation","Time domain analysis","Robustness","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","frequency division multiple access","frequency estimation","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radio links","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative joint frequency-offset method","channel estimation methods","OFDMA uplink","SAGE","space alternating generalized expectation-maximization method","multiuser interference cancellation","time-frequency domains","ad hoc method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Two novel iterative joint frequency-offset and channel estimation methods for OFDMA uplink","volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4471942/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9919962","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two novel iterative joint frequency-offset and channel estimation methods for OFDMA uplink","sourcePdf":"tc_0803_474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113252S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4471920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4471920","articleId":"4471942","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4471943,"authors":[{"name":"Chuxiang Li","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4471920/4471943/4471943-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuxiang Li received the B.S. degree and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York, NY, in 2006.

We develop design methods to find the optimum code ensemble for the partial FG. In particular, we formulate the relay operations and the destination operations as equivalent virtual MISO and MIMO systems, and employ a binary symmetric channel (BSC) model for the relay node output. For AWGN channels, we further develop a Gaussian approximation for the detector output at the destination node. Jointly treating the relay and the destination, we analyze the performance of the LDPC-coded relay system using the extrinsic mutual information transfer(EXIT) chart technique. Furthermore, differential evolution is employed to search for the optimum code ensemble. Our results show that the optimized codes always outperform the regular LDPC codes with a significant gain; in the AWGN case, when Protocol-II is employed and the relay is close to the source, the optimized code performs within 0.1dB to the capacity bound.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2008.060032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4471920/04471943.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC-coded cooperative relay systems: performance analysis and code design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"LDPC-coded cooperative relay systems: performance analysis and code design","volume":"56","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9919963","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4471943/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC-coded cooperative relay systems: performance analysis and code design","sourcePdf":"tc_0803_485.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067253S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4471920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4471920","articleId":"4471943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4471944,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Zuccardi Merli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and INFM, Modena, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4471920/4471944/4471944-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Filippo Zuccardi Merli was born in Correggio, Italy, in July 1980.

Simulations show that the combined power allocation and proportional fairness scheduler achieves significant gains over a conventional round-robin scheduler, in terms of both cell average and cell edge throughput.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2008.071697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4471946/04471952.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2008.071697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Uplink Power Control in Two-Cell Systems with Rise-over-Thermal Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471952/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Uplink Power Control in Two-Cell Systems with Rise-over-Thermal Constraints","volume":"12","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9902712","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4471952/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Uplink Power Control in Two-Cell Systems with Rise-over-Thermal Constraints","sourcePdf":"cl_0803_173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048813S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4471946","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4471946","articleId":"4471952","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4471957,"authors":[{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research (CWCSPR), New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, University of Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski","id":"37281987200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4471957","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Information analysis","Wireless networks","Spine","Joining processes","Downlink","Interference","Propagation losses","Performance analysis","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","Gaussian channels","information theory","radio networks","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure communications","cooperating base stations","confidential communications","infrastructure-based wireless networks","information theory","high-capacity backbone","uplink-downlink transmissions","spectral efficiency","Gaussian channels","fading channels","partial channel state information"]}],"abstract":"A novel approach for ensuring confidential communications over infrastructure-based wireless networks is proposed and analyzed from an information-theoretic standpoint.

The power optimization across layers is considered with a short-term power constraint. In addition, for block- fading channels, the rate optimization across layers is studied to maximize the throughput when the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is not available. Since the CSI is not available, the rates can be greater than the instantaneous channel capacity and error propagation in the SC receiver is inevitable. Thus, the rate optimization plays a key role in reducing the chance of error propagation to maximize the throughput. It is shown that the optimal rates can be obtained recursively and each optimization can be carried out by a one-dimensional search.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04471981.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity/Throughput Optimization for H-BLAST with SC Receiver over MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity/Throughput Optimization for H-BLAST with SC Receiver over MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9905497","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4471981/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity/Throughput Optimization for H-BLAST with SC Receiver over MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_1016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055785S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4471981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4471985,"authors":[{"name":"Yugang Jia","affiliation":["University of Bristol, Bristol, UK","Philips Research Asia, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4471978/4471985/4471985-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yugang Jia was born in P.R.

To this end, we propose a method which utilizes knowledge on both the instantaneous and average channel conditions in order to encompass this concept, by attributing a weight coefficient to each relay depending on its average channel state and then selecting the relay with the best instantaneous \"weighted\" channel conditions. We also provide a performance analysis of the proposed scheme that includes an analytical expression for the outage probability, together with a closed form one in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. Through the latter expression, the average symbol error probability (ASEP) for high SNRs is also derived. Numerical results demonstrate that, for small number of available relays or for high SNRs, the performance of the proposed scheme resembles that of the \"best relay selection\" scheme, in terms of outage probability and ASEP, despite maintaining the average power consumptions equal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PHY-layer Fairness in Amplify and Forward Cooperative Diversity Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060825","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04471987.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"PHY-layer Fairness in Amplify and Forward Cooperative Diversity Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4471987/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913674","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PHY-layer Fairness in Amplify and Forward Cooperative Diversity Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_1073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067597S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4471987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4471990,"authors":[{"name":"Nalin S.

We derive an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with low-rank approximation to avoid inverting large-size matrices, and thus drastically reduce the receiver complexity. In the iterative process, channel parameters are initially obtained by a least square (LS) estimator for temporary symbol decisions. Then, inter-carrier interference (ICI) due to fast fading is approximated and canceled. Finally, the temporary symbol decisions and the ICI-canceled received signals are processed by the EM-based MAP estimator to refine the channel state information for improved detection. The proposed scheme achieves about 2 dB gain over the LS scheme in channels with medium to high normalized Doppler shifts.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.051072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04471991.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.051072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","startPage":"774","endPage":"780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Map Channel Estimation for Mobile MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Map Channel Estimation for Mobile MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471991/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913646","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4471991/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Map Channel Estimation for Mobile MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_774.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061045S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4471991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4471992,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Hee Han","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, South Korea","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Seung Hee","lastName":"Han","id":"37278482000"},{"name":"John M.

Considering different values of combined transmissions and M-QAM with possible constellation rearrangement (CoRe), validation of the proposed BER analytical model through simulations and assessment of the advantages of packet combining are provided for transmissions over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and orthogonalized MIMO Rayleigh fading channels with different STBC mappings.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04471995.pdf","startPage":"799","endPage":"805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER Analysis of M-QAM with Packet Combining Over Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4471995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4471995/","displayDocTitle":"BER Analysis of M-QAM with Packet Combining Over Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Fading Channels","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913648","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4471995/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER Analysis of M-QAM with Packet Combining Over Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05639S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4471995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4471996,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37534503300"},{"name":"Chun Sum Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chun Sum","lastName":"Ng","id":"37279921400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"4471996","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Receivers","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Mathematical model","Intersymbol interference","Ultra wideband technology","Computational modeling","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","radio receivers","space-time codes","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSTBC impulse radios","autocorrelation receiver","ISI-free UWB channels","multiple transmit antennas","mathematical model","bit-error-rate performance","intersymbol interference-free transmission","signal-to-noise ratio","transmitted-reference impulse radio","differential space-time block coded impulse radio","ultra-wideband channel","2-transmit antennas","Q-receive antennas","BER performance"]}],"abstract":"For transmitted-reference impulse radio, it has been experimentally shown that multiple transmit antennas can provide an energy boost in the received signal.

The use of analog or unquantized symbols for CSI feedback leads to a low feedback rate of only one symbol per transmit antenna per frame, and does not result in an unrecoverable distortion as in the traditional digital CSI feedback approach. The BER of differential BPSK and 8PSK in the downlink of the proposed system is evaluated via computer simulation. The results show that analog feedback can perform substantially better than digital feedback under some operating conditions. Another contribution of the paper is the use of position dependent modulation (PDM) to counter the varying beamforming quality across the data frame. It was shown that PDM can substantially increase the downlink throughput (relative to optimal fixed modulation) at given target BERs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060597","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04472006.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060597","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"878","endPage":"887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit beamforming with analog channel state information feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Transmit beamforming with analog channel state information feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472006/","volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4472006/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913657","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit beamforming with analog channel state information feedback","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079391S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4472006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4472007,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Nikjah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4471978/4472007/4472007-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Nikjah (S'05) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in September 2000, and the M.Sc. degree in communication engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in January 2003.

The results were applied to a unified channel model encompassing a variety of multiuser spread spectrum systems contaminated by jamming. It was found that the jammer should spread its energy evenly over all degrees of freedom in order to minimize the average capacity. In the second part of the paper, using a standard orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) model, the performance of a coded version of a multicarrier frequency-hopping (MC-FH) CDMA system in static and Rayleigh fading jamming uplink channels is analyzed. The MC-FH system under study is a hybrid of the OFDM and frequency hopping concepts, and is also a practical example of the model developed in the first part. It is demonstrated that in the cases where the receiver knows the jammer state and the receiver lacks the jammer state, spreading and contracting the jamming power over the system bandwidth, respectively, will give rise to the worst performance for the communicators. Optimal decorrelator weights for the receiver soft outputs in different channels, valuable for practical system design, are also obtained.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Frequency","Spread spectrum communication","Jamming","OFDM","Information analysis","Downlink","Fading","Code standards","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","frequency hop communication","jamming","Nakagami channels","OFDM modulation","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA systems","antijamming performance","coded multicarrier frequency-hopping spread spectrum systems","multiuser code division multiple access","jamming channel capacity","noncooperative users","uplink channel","downlink static channel","Nakagami fading channels","unified channel model","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM model","optimal decorrelator weights","receiver soft outputs","cooperative users"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472007","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060627","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04472007.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060627","startPage":"888","endPage":"897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Antijamming in General CDMA Systems-Part II: Antijamming Performance of Coded Multicarrier Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Antijamming in General CDMA Systems-Part II: Antijamming Performance of Coded Multicarrier Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472007/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4472007/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913658","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Antijamming in General CDMA Systems-Part II: Antijamming Performance of Coded Multicarrier Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089374S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4472007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4472008,"authors":[{"name":"Siavash Ekbatani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4471978/4472008/4472008-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siavash Ekbatani received the B.S. degree from the school of Electrical Engineering of the Sharif University of Technology in 2003 and the M.S. degree in 2005 from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of California Irvine, where he is currently a Ph.D. candidate.

The combining is performed using a class of constellation sets inspired from orthogonal designs and directional beamforming or in general, unitary preceding with quantized feedback. This constellation class is called partly orthogonal designs (PODs). The conventional way of combining coding and quantized feedback beamforming is through precoded space-time block codes (PSTBCs) that provide full-diversity order with all system configurations in terms of the number of feedback regions and the number of transmit antennas. PODs maintain the same advantage. However, they require less decoding and quantization complexity compared to PSTBCs. We develop POD structures, analyze their performance, and optimize them based on pairwise error probability analysis. PODs create a larger combining space compared to PSTBCs. We can show that with certain system configurations, PODs outperform PSTBCs. Using PODs, we also propose a combined coding, beamforming, and spatial multiplexing scheme over multiple-antenna multi-user channels that enables a low-complexity joint interference cancellation scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04472008.pdf","startPage":"898","endPage":"908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Beamforming and Space-Time Coding Using Quantized Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Feedback","Performance analysis","Fading","Channel state information","Transmitters","Block codes","Transmitting antennas","Antenna feeds","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","interference suppression","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","probability","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time coding","transmit beamforming","multiple-antenna quasistatic fading channels","limited-rate channel state information","directional beamforming","constellation class","partly orthogonal designs","quantized feedback beamforming","precoded space-time block codes","transmit antennas","quantization complexity","pairwise error probability analysis","spatial multiplexing scheme","multiple-antenna multiuser channels","low-complexity joint interference cancellation scheme","unitary preceding","MIMO channels","MISO channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472008/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Combining Beamforming and Space-Time Coding Using Quantized Feedback","volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4472008/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913659","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Beamforming and Space-Time Coding Using Quantized Feedback","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104469S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4472008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4472010,"authors":[{"name":"Juan M.

We assume the signal from the desired user at the receive antenna array to be affected by Rice, Nakagami or Rayleigh fading, while CCI signals are assumed to experience Rayleigh fading. We provide closed-form analytical expressions for the outage probability of different diversity schemes, such as maximal ratio combining (MRC) and optimum combining (OC), and also for interference cancellation (IC) based on antenna beamsteering, which steers nulls in the array radiation pattern in the direction of the strongest interferers. Our analysis provides a unified framework for studying outage probability of different multiple-antenna reception strategies, and our closed- form expressions are easily computed, facilitating a performance comparison under a range of operating conditions. Our numerical results show that IC yields significantly better performance than MRC if the system is interference-limited and the number of dominant interferers is lower than the number of receive antennas, or when the output SINR is low. In addition, when the background noise can be neglected, we provide numerical results for MRC and OC when the signals from the desired user at the different receive antennas are arbitrarily distributed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04472010.pdf","startPage":"920","endPage":"932","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receive Antenna Array Strategies in Fading and Interference: An Outage Probability Comparison","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays","Fading","Diversity reception","Radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","Interchannel interference","Pattern analysis","Interference cancellation","Directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","cochannel interference","diversity reception","fading channels","interference suppression","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receive antenna array strategies","outage probability","reception strategy","multiple receive antenna","fading channels","cochannel interference","tradeoff analysis","closed-form analytical expression","diversity scheme","maximal ratio combining","optimum combining","interference cancellation","antenna beamsteering","array radiation pattern","strongest interferer","multiple antenna reception strategies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Receive Antenna Array Strategies in Fading and Interference: An Outage Probability Comparison","volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4472010/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913661","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receive Antenna Array Strategies in Fading and Interference: An Outage Probability Comparison","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109266S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4472010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4472012,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed El-Hajjar","affiliation":["University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4471978/4472012/4472012-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammed EI-Hajjar received the B.

The DSTS scheme can be readily combined with PSK, QAM as well as SP modulation schemes. The SP-aided DSTS system advocated has low-complexity encoding and decoding algorithms that require no channel knowledge and it is capable of outperforming the DSTS system dispensing with sphere packing. Further system performance improvements can be attained by serially concatenated convolutional encoding combined with a unity-rate code (URC) referred to as a precoder. Then, at the receiver side, iterative decoding is invoked by exchanging extrinsic information between the precoder's decoder as well as the outer recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) code's decoder. Moreover, the convergence behaviour of the proposed system is evaluated with the aid of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. Explicitly, the turbo-detected precoded DSTS-SP system performs within 1.6 dB of the achievable multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) capacity. Finally, in contrast to an equivalent 0.5 bit/symbol throughput turbo- detected DSTS-SP scheme using no preceding, the turbo-detected precoded DSTS-SP scheme exhibits no error floor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo Detection of Precoded Sphere Packing Modulation Using Four Transmit Antennas for Differential Space-Time Spreading","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.060708","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04472012.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.060708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Turbo Detection of Precoded Sphere Packing Modulation Using Four Transmit Antennas for Differential Space-Time Spreading","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4472012/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913662","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo Detection of Precoded Sphere Packing Modulation Using Four Transmit Antennas for Differential Space-Time Spreading","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082928S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4472012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4472013,"authors":[{"name":"Veljko Stankovic","affiliation":["Univ.

The approach used for the design of the precoding matrix is general and the resulting algorithm can address several optimization criteria with an arbitrary number of antennas at the user terminals.

In the first step we minimize the overlap of the row spaces spanned by the effective channel matrices of different users using a new cost function. In the next step, we optimize the system performance with respect to specific optimization criteria assuming a set of parallel single- user MIMO channels. By combining the closed form solution with Tomlinson-Harashima precoding we reach the maximum sum-rate capacity when the total number of antennas at the user terminals is less or equal to the number of antennas at the base station. By iterating the closed form solution with appropriate power loading we are able to extract the full diversity in the system and reach the maximum sum-rate capacity in case of high multi-user interference. Joint processing over a group of multi-user MIMO channels in different frequency and time slots yields maximum diversity regardless of the level of multi-user interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Design of Multi-User MIMO Precoding Matrices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2008.060709","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04472013.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2008.060709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472013/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Design of Multi-User MIMO Precoding Matrices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4472013/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913663","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Design of Multi-User MIMO Precoding Matrices","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063296S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4472013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4472014,"authors":[{"name":"Ian C.

Previous research efforts to optimize OFDMA resource allocation with respect to communication performance have focused on formulations considering only instantaneous per-symbol rate maximization, and on solutions using suboptimal heuristic algorithms. This paper intends to fill gaps in the literature through two key contributions. First, we formulate continuous and discrete ergodic weighted sum rate maximization in OFDMA assuming the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI). Our formulations exploit time, frequency, and multi-user diversity, while enforcing various notions of fairness through weighting factors for each user. Second, we derive algorithms based on a dual optimization framework that solve the OFDMA ergodic rate maximization problem with O(MK) complexity per OFDMA symbol for M users and K subcarriers, while achieving data rates shown to be at least 99.9999% of the optimal rate in simulations based on realistic parameters. Hence, this paper attempts to demonstrate that OFDMA resource allocation problems are not computationally prohibitive to solve optimally, even when considering ergodic rates.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2008.4472014","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4471978/04472014.pdf","startPage":"962","endPage":"971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2008.4472014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Downlink OFDMA Resource Allocation with Linear Complexity to Maximize Ergodic Rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472014/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Downlink OFDMA Resource Allocation with Linear Complexity to Maximize Ergodic Rates","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9913664","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472014/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Downlink OFDMA Resource Allocation with Linear Complexity to Maximize Ergodic Rates","sourcePdf":"tw_0803_962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092808S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4471978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4471978","articleId":"4472014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4472016,"authors":[{"name":"Marios Gatzianas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Division of Telecommunications, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4471978/4472016/4472016-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marios Gatzianas received the Diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece and the M.S. degree in EE from Arizona State University in 2000 and 2003, respectively.

Music is one of the most popular types of online information and there are now hundreds of music streaming and download services operating on the World-Wide Web. Some of the music collections available are approaching the scale of ten million tracks and this has posed a major challenge for searching, retrieving, and organizing music content. Research efforts in music information retrieval have involved experts from music perception, cognition, musicology, engineering, and computer science engaged in truly interdisciplinary activity that has resulted in many proposed algorithmic and methodological solutions to music search using content-based methods. This paper outlines the problems of content-based music information retrieval and explores the state-of-the-art methods using audio cues (e.g., query by humming, audio fingerprinting, content-based music retrieval) and other cues (e.g., music notation and symbolic representation), and identifies some of the major challenges for the coming years.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content-Based Music Information Retrieval: Current Directions and Future Challenges","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2008.916370","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4472076/04472077.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2008.916370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4472076","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472077","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Content-Based Music Information Retrieval: Current Directions and Future Challenges","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"96","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4472077/","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9918716","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content-Based Music Information Retrieval: Current Directions and Future Challenges","sourcePdf":"96jproc04-casey.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179789S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4472076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"299","xplore-issue":"4472076","articleId":"4472077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4472119,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Luisa de La Fuente","affiliation":["Departmento de Ing. de Comunicaciones, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria Luisa","lastName":"de La Fuente","id":"38180504000"},{"name":"Juan Pablo Pascual","affiliation":["Departmento de Ing. de Comunicaciones, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Pablo","lastName":"Pascual","id":"37286842200"},{"name":"Enrique Barajas","affiliation":["Departmento de Ing. de Comunicaciones, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Barajas","id":"37421463500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-0992"}],"articleNumber":"4472119","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":507},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Region 9","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/reg/9/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472119","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MMICs","Design engineering","Integrated circuit technology","Microwave technology","Microwave theory and techniques","Monolithic integrated circuits","Foundries","Proposals","Knowledge engineering","Research and development"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Education","Integrated Circuits","Microwaves","MMIC design","Telecommunications Engineer"]}],"abstract":"Since the origin of Monolithic technologies during the seventies, apprenticeship of Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits (MMIC) design techniques has been a discipline linked to foundries, which have instructed engineers from customer companies in their particular technologies.

This approach involves the implementation of a fault current limiter (FCL) to locally limit the DG fault current, and thus restore the original relay coordination. The proposed restoration approach is carried out without altering the original relay settings or disconnecting DGs from PDSs during fault. Therefore, it is applicable to both the current practice of disconnecting DGs from PDSs, and the emergent trend of keeping DGs in PDSs during fault. The process of selecting FCL impedance type (inductive or resistive) and its minimum value is illustrated. Three scenarios are discussed: no DG, the implementation of DG with FCL and without FCL. Various simulations are carried out for both single- and multi-DG existence, and different DG and fault locations. The obtained results are reported and discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restoration of Directional Overcurrent Relay Coordination in Distributed Generation Systems Utilizing Fault Current Limiter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2008.915778","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4476461/04472157.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2008.915778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Restoration of Directional Overcurrent Relay Coordination in Distributed Generation Systems Utilizing Fault Current Limiter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4472157/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920709","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restoration of Directional Overcurrent Relay Coordination in Distributed Generation Systems Utilizing Fault Current Limiter","sourcePdf":"23tpwrd02-elkhattam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071781S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4476461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"4476461","articleId":"4472157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4472160,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Luo","affiliation":["Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/4476461/4472160/4472160-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xu Luo (S'05\u2013M'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2007.","Currently, he is with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), focusing on EMS and MMS application development.

A unique feature of the proposed method is that it ensures the constructed rational function is always positive-real, thereby guaranteeing synthesis of a physically realizable network every time. This feature could not always be guaranteed by earlier methods. Hence, it was a limitation. The proposed method is demonstrated on a single-layer model winding and the measured terminal characteristics is converted to a lumped parameter ladder network, since this representation is naturally suited to establish a physical mapping between the actual winding and synthesized circuit. So, the need to guarantee physical realizability is evident.

Two families of 1-W light-emitting diodes (LEDs) from different manufacturers were submitted to distinct stress conditions: high temperature storage without bias and high dc current test. During aging, degradation mechanisms like light output decay and electrical property worsening were detected. In particular, the degradation in light efficiency induced by thermal storage was found to follow an exponential law, and the activation energy of the process was extrapolated. Aged devices exhibited a modification of the package epoxy color from white to brown. The instability of the package contributes to the overall degradation in terms of optical and spectral properties. In addition, an increase in thermal resistance was detected on one family of LEDs. This increase induces higher junction temperature levels during operative conditions. In order to correlate the degradation mechanisms and kinetics found during thermal stress, a high dc current stress was performed. Results from this comparative analysis showed similar behavior, implying that the degradation process of dc current aged devices is thermal activated due to high temperatures reached by the junction during stress. Finally, the different effects of the stress on two families of LEDs were taken into account in order to identify the impact of aging on device structure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Life estimation","Life testing","Brightness","Light emitting diodes","Thermal stresses","Thermal degradation","Aging","Temperature","Packaging","Thermal resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","brightness","light emitting diodes","thermal conductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerated life test","high brightness LED","light emitting diodes","aging","electrical property","light output decay","thermal storage","exponential law","activation energy","package epoxy color","thermal resistance","junction temperature","dc current"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Life estimation","light-emitting diodes (LEDs)","semiconductor device thermal factors","semiconductor materials measurements"]},{"kwd":["Light-emitting diodes","Life estimation","Semiconductor device thermal factors","Semiconductor materials measurements"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2008.919596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/4539815/04472171.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4539815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2008.919596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated Life Test of High Brightness Light Emitting Diodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated Life Test of High Brightness Light Emitting Diodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472171/","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472171/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10074507","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated Life Test of High Brightness Light Emitting Diodes","sourcePdf":"08tdmr02-trevisanello.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057859S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"4539815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"4539815","articleId":"4472171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4472173,"authors":[{"name":"Francesc Auli-Llinas","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4550594/4472173/4472173-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesc Aul\u00ed-Llin\u00e0s (S'06\u2013M'08) received the B.Sc. and B.E. degrees in computer management engineering and computer engineering both with highest honors from the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain, in 2000 and 2002, respectively. from 2002 to 2006, he held a doctoral fellowship funded by the Catalan Government, receiving the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science in 2004 and 2006, respectively, also from the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona.","He is the main developer of BOI, a free JPEG2000 Part 1 implementation that has been awarded by the Catalan Government.

Two points, related with the practical use of quality layers, may need to be addressed when dealing with JPEG2000 code-streams: 1) the lack of quality scalability of code-streams containing a single or few quality layers and 2) the rate-distortion optimality of windows of interest transmission. Addressing these two points, this paper proposes a mechanism that, without using quality layers, provides competitive quality scalability to code-streams. Its main key-feature is a novel characterization of the code-blocks rate-distortion contribution that does not use distortion measures based on the original image, or related with the encoding process. Evaluations against the common use of quality layers, and against a theoretical optimal coding performance when decoding windows of interest or when decoding the complete image area, suggest that the proposed method achieves close to optimal results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","volume":"18","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"10073275","publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472173/","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"JPEG2000 Quality Scalability Without Quality Layers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"JPEG2000 Quality Scalability Without Quality Layers","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt07-aulillianas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095315S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4550594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4550594","articleId":"4472173","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":4472174,"authors":[{"name":"Yaser Pourmohammadi Fallah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4550594/4472174/4472174-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yaser Pourmohammadi Fallah (S'97\u2013M'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (electronics) from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1998, and the M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2001 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, and is pursuing research in the field of multimedia networking and wireless communications.

The 802.11 based networks use a link adaptation mechanism in the physical layer (PHY) to maintain the reliability of transmission under varying channel conditions. When channel condition worsens, the reliability is maintained by employing more robust modulation and coding schemes, at the cost of reduced PHY bit rate. The reduced bit rate will result in lower available throughput for applications. For scalable video streaming applications, the conventional solution to this problem is to reduce the video bit rate by dropping the higher enhancement layers of the scalable video. We show in this article that the video quality can be improved, if the link adaptation scheme uses more intelligent reliability criteria and adjusts the PHY parameters used for delivering each video layer, according to the relative importance of that layer. Our scheme achieves better video quality without increasing the traffic load of the WLAN. For this purpose we present temporal fairness constraints and formulate an optimization problem for assigning different PHY modes to different layers of scalable video; the solution to this problem provides a set of PHY configuration parameters that achieve the highest possible video quality while meeting the admission control constraints in the network. Performance evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.920745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4550594/04472174.pdf","startPage":"875","endPage":"887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.920745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Link Adaptation Scheme for Efficient Transmission of H.264 Scalable Video Over Multirate WLANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472174","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472174/","displayDocTitle":"A Link Adaptation Scheme for Efficient Transmission of H.264 Scalable Video Over Multirate WLANs","volume":"18","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10073276","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472174/","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Link Adaptation Scheme for Efficient Transmission of H.264 Scalable Video Over Multirate WLANs","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt07-fallah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109948S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4550594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4550594","articleId":"4472174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4472175,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4550594/4472175/4472175-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhigang Gao (S'04\u2013M'05) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 1997, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently with the Wireless Network Business Unit, Cisco Systems, Inc.

The spatial-frequency decomposition property of DWT provides possibility for not only the new compression algorithm but also a frequency-domain quality assessment method. For facilitating the new algorithm, a new quality metric in the wavelet domain called WNMSE is suggested, which assesses the quality of an image with the weighted sum of normalized mean square errors of the wavelet coefficients. The metric is consistent with the human judgment of visual quality as well as able to estimate the quality during the compression process. Based on the relationship between the statistic features, quantization steps, and the weighted normalized mean square error value of the image, we develop a quality constrained quantization algorithm which can determine the quantization step-sizes for all the wavelet subbands for compressing the image to a desired visual quality accurately.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.920744","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4550594/04472175.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.920744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"910","endPage":"922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality Constrained Compression Using DWT-Based Image Quality Metric","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Quality Constrained Compression Using DWT-Based Image Quality Metric","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472175/","volume":"18","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4472175/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10073277","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality Constrained Compression Using DWT-Based Image Quality Metric","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt07-gao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134712S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4550594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4550594","articleId":"4472175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-27"},{"_id":4472178,"authors":[{"name":"Grzegorz Pastuszak","affiliation":["Institute of Radioelectronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4550594/4472178/4472178-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Grzegorz Pastuszak received the M.S. degree in microelectronics and the Ph.D. degree in multimedia technology from Warsaw University of Technologies, Warsaw, Poland, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","From 2001 to 2002, he was an ASIC designer in FFC, Tokyo, Japan, and Fujitsu Devices, Yokohama, Japan.

The module conforms to H.264/AVC High Profile and supports two binary coding modes: context adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC) and context adaptive variable-length coding (CAVLC). The architecture saves a considerable amount of hardware resources since two coding modes share the same logic and storage elements. Five versions of the arithmetic coding path are developed to study the area/performance tradeoff related to parallel symbol encoding. The implementation results show that the parallel symbol encoding allows higher efficiency. The whole architecture of the binary coder is described in VHDL and synthesized for different configurations to show the implementation cost of some coding options. For both CAVLC and CABAC modes, the architecture achieves the similar throughput able to support HDTV in real time.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.920743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4550594/04472178.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.920743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550594","startPage":"949","endPage":"960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Performance Architecture of the Double-Mode Binary Coder for H.264.AVC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A High-Performance Architecture of the Double-Mode Binary Coder for H.264.AVC","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 June 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10073284","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4472178/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Performance Architecture of the Double-Mode Binary Coder for H.264.AVC","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt07-pastuszak.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082031S","chronDate":"July  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4550594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4550594","articleId":"4472178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4472179,"authors":[{"name":"An-Chao Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"An-Chao","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37297436100"},{"name":"Jhing-Fa Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhing-Fa","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280532500"},{"name":"Jar-Ferr Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jar-Ferr","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280193800"},{"name":"Wei-Guang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Guang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37833432200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"4472179","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":534},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472179","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rate-distortion","Very large scale integration","CMOS technology","Automatic voltage control","Cost function","Detection algorithms","Encoding","Performance loss","Hardware","Circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","optimisation","rate distortion theory","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast direction detection","intra-frame coding","H.264/AVC","rate-distortion optimization","subblock difference","pixel direction difference","VLSI","CMOS technology","pipeline architecture","size 0.18 mum","frequency 173 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge direction detection","H264/AVC","intra-prediction","Joint Video Team (JVT)","rate-distortion (RD) optimization"]},{"kwd":["H.264/AV","intra prediction","edge direction detection","rate-distortion ( -D) optimization","Joint Video Team (JVT)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.920742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4550594/04472179.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.920742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4550594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Subblock-Based and Pixel-Based Fast Direction Detections for H.264 Intra Prediction","abstract":"In H.264/AVC intra-frame coding, the rate-distortion optimization (RDO) is employed to select the optimal coding mode to achieve the minimum rate-distortion cost.

Properly designed, an SAF will converge faster at a lower computational cost than a fullband structure. However, its design should consider the following two facts: the interband aliasing introduced by the downsampling process degrades its performance, and the filter bank in the SAF introduces additional computational overhead and system delay. In this paper, to fully exploit the benefits of using an SAF, an almost alias-free SAF structure with critical sampling is proposed. The interband alising is removed from the subband signal by isolating the aliasing using a bandwidth-increased analysis filter. Computer simulations show that the proposed structure converges faster than both an equivalent fullband structure at lower computational complexity and recently proposed SAF structures for a colored input.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Sampling methods","Computational efficiency","Degradation","Filter bank","Delay systems","Signal sampling","Signal analysis","Computer simulation","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","computational complexity","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alias-free subband adaptive filtering","critical sampling","fullband adaptive filtering","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive filtering","interband aliasing","LMS algorithm","multirate signal processing","subband adaptive filtering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.912262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4490093/04472186.pdf","startPage":"1894","endPage":"1904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.912262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alias-Free Subband Adaptive Filtering With Critical Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Alias-Free Subband Adaptive Filtering With Critical Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472186/","volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472186/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9921335","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alias-Free Subband Adaptive Filtering With Critical Sampling","sourcePdf":"56tsp05-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085044S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4490093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4490093","articleId":"4472186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4472189,"authors":[{"name":"Peng-Lang Shui","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4490093/4472189/4472189-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng-Lang Shui (M'03) received the M.S. degree in mathematics from Nanjing University, China, and the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1992 and 1999, respectively.","He is now a professor with National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University.

The phase histories of signals are assumed to be unknown smooth functions of time and these functions are poorly modeled or unmodeled by a small number of parameters. Thus, the conventional parametric-based detection methods are invalid in these cases. This paper proposes a nonparametric detection method using the ridge energy of observations. The detection process consists of three steps, TF ridge detection, ridge energy extraction, and decision. First, the directionally smoothed-pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution (DSPWVD) is introduced to highlight the instantaneous frequency (IF) points along a special direction on the IF curve of a signal from noise. Further, an angular maximal distribution (AMAD) is constructed from a set of DSPWVDs to highlight the entire IF curve. As a result, the TF ridge of an observation can be estimated well from its AMAD by the maxima position detector. Second, the ridge energy, the total energy along the TF ridge on the pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution (PWVD), is extracted. A noisy signal has larger ridge energy than a pure noise does, with a large probability, because pure noise energy is randomly distributed throughout the TF plane while the signal energy in a noisy signal is concentrated along the estimated TF ridge. Third, the ridge energy of an observation is used as the test statistic to decide whether or not a signal of interest is present in the observation, where the decision threshold is determined by a large number of Monte Carlo simulations using pure noise. Finally, the simulation experiments to two test signals are made to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Time frequency

Energy Decentralized Estimation via Exploiting the Statistical Knowledge of Sensor Noise Variance","abstract":"We study the problem of minimal-energy decentralized estimation via sensor networks with the best-linear-unbiased-estimator fusion rule. While most of the existing solutions require the knowledge of instantaneous noise variances for energy allocation, the proposed approach instead relies on an associated statistical model. The minimization of total energy is subject to a performance constraint in terms of the reciprocal of mean square errors averaged over the considered distribution. A closed-form formula for such a mean distortion metric, as well as an associated tractable lower bound, is derived. By imposing a target distortion constraint in terms of this bound and further through feasible set relaxation, the problem can be reformulated in the form of convex optimization and is then analytically solved. The proposed method shares several attractive features of the existing designs via instantaneous noise variances. Through simulations it is seen to significantly improve the energy efficiency against the uniform allocation scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","volume":"56","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"9921354","publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472190/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Minimal Energy Decentralized Estimation via Exploiting the Statistical Knowledge of Sensor Noise Variance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal Energy Decentralized Estimation via Exploiting the Statistical Knowledge of Sensor Noise Variance","sourcePdf":"56tsp05-wu-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093229S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4490093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4490093","articleId":"4472190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4472220,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Fingscheidt","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Technology, Braunschweig Technical University, Brunswick, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4489993/4472220/4472220-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tim Fingscheidt (S'93\u2013M'98\u2013SM'04) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree from Aachen University of Technology, Aachen, Germany, in 1993 and 1998, respectively.","He further pursued his work on joint speech and channel coding as a Consultant in the Speech Processing Software and Technology Research Department, AT&T Labs, Florham Park, NJ.

In contrast to many state-of-the-art approaches, we do not model the probability density function (pdf) of the clean speech and the noise spectra. Instead, subband-individual weighting rules for noisy speech spectral amplitudes are separately trained for speech presence and speech absence from noise recordings in the environment of interest. Weighting rules for a variety of cost functions are given; they are parameterized and stored as a table look-up. The speech enhancement system simply works by computing the weighting rules from the table look-up indexed by the a posteriori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the a priori SNR for each subband computed on a Bark scale. Optimized for an automotive environment, our approach outperforms known-environment-independent-speech enhancement techniques, namely the a priori SNR-driven Wiener filter and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) log-spectral amplitude estimator, both in terms of speech distortion and noise attenuation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4472220/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9966050","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Environment-Optimized Speech Enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Environment-Optimized Speech Enhancement","sourcePdf":"16tasl04-fingscheidt.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098216S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4489993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4489993","articleId":"4472220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4472239,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Romberg","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Justin Romberg (jrom@ece.gatech.edu.) attended Rice University, where he received the B.S.

Different from the prior research works, the effects of both variation range and probability distribution of the time delay are involved in the proposed method. First, a modeling method is proposed by translating the probability distribution of the time delay into parameter matrices of the transformed DRNN model, where the delay is characterized by a stochastic binary distributed variable. Based on the new method, the global exponential stability in the mean square sense for the DRNNs with stochastic delay is investigated by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and exploiting some new analysis techniques.

This frequency-selective surface is made up of a 2-D periodic array of metallic loop and a wire grid of the same period printed on either side of a very thin substrate. Unique features of the new design include localized frequency-selective properties, high-order frequency response achieved by a single substrate, lack of passband harmonics in the frequency response, and very low frequency response sensitivity to the incidence angle. High-order frequency response is accomplished through the application of a thin substrate that allows considerable couplings between the elements on the two sides of the substrate. The layers' couplings in conjunction with each layer characteristics are designed to produce a high-Q bandpass frequency response, in addition to a transmission zero. It is shown that by inserting variable capacitors in the gap between the metallic loops, the center frequency of the passband can be tuned over nearly an octave. In addition, using a cluster of loops as the unit cell and modifying the parameters of the loops within the cluster, a dual-band characteristic from a single-layer miniaturized-element frequency-selective surface can be achieved.

The tunable filter offers a fixed passband and a tunable one. The center frequency of the upper passband can be electrically tuned, whereas the performance of the lower one is maintained constant.

A distributed automatic control approach is proposed to alleviate the voltage rise caused by active power injection. The objective of the proposed approach is not to control bus voltage but to guarantee that generator injections alone do not cause significant voltage rise: a solution in which distribution network operators (DNOs) are kept to their traditional task of voltage regulation for load demand. The approach is discussed in the perspective of effectiveness and adequacy. Its consequences to DNO control effort are evaluated. Illustration is provided for a single feeder with stochastic generation and transformer on-load tap-changing voltage regulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4494587/04472349.pdf","startPage":"766","endPage":"772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Reactive Power Generation Control for Voltage Rise Mitigation in Distribution Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power control","Distributed power generation","Power generation","Voltage control","Automatic voltage control","Reactive power","Communication system control","Distributed control","Automatic generation control","Centralized control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","power distribution control","power generation control","reactive power control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Distributed Reactive Power Generation Control","Voltage Rise Mitigation","Distribution Networks","distributed automatic control approach","generator injections","distribution network operators","voltage regulation","load demand","stochastic generation","transformer on-load tap-changing voltage regulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dispersed storage and generation","power distribution","power quality","risk analysis","voltage control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Reactive Power Generation Control for Voltage Rise Mitigation in Distribution Networks","volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4472349/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922137","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Reactive Power Generation Control for Voltage Rise Mitigation in Distribution Networks","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs02-carvalho.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053578S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4494587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"439","xplore-issue":"4494587","articleId":"4472349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4472350,"authors":[{"name":"Tongxin Zheng","affiliation":["ISO New England, Inc., Holyoke, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Tongxin Zheng (M'02) received the B.S. degree from North China Institute of Electric Power, Baoding, China, the M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Clemson University, Clemson, SC, in 1993, 1996, and 1999, respectively.","He is currently a Principal Analyst at the ISO New England, Holyoke, MA.

This paper presents the market clearing framework for the co-optimized real-time energy-reserve market that has been developed and implemented in the ISO New England (ISO NE). In this co-optimized market clearing model, reserve products are procured on a zonal basis to satisfy the first and the second contingency protection criteria required by the ISO NE's real-time operations for both the entire area and typical import-constrained areas. The proposed zonal reserve model is derived from simulating each contingency event in the predefined reserve zones. Differing from standard industrial practices, the proposed zonal reserve model recognizes reserve deliverability for nested reserve zones and allocates the zonal total transfer capability between energy and reserves in an economic way. Numerical examples for a two-zone system are presented to demonstrate the validity of this modeling technique.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4494587/04472350.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contingency-Based Zonal Reserve Modeling and Pricing in a Co-Optimized Energy and Reserve Market","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Contingency-Based Zonal Reserve Modeling and Pricing in a Co-Optimized Energy and Reserve Market","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472350/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922192","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contingency-Based Zonal Reserve Modeling and Pricing in a Co-Optimized Energy and Reserve Market","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs02-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069114S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4494587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4494587","articleId":"4472350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4472351,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihe Zhou","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA","Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4663192/4472351/4472351-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhihe Zhou received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1991, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Washington State University, Pullman, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","He joined AMD Inc., Austin, TX, in 2006 and is currently working on high-speed analog and mixed-signal circuit design."]},"firstName":"Zhihe","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37421343000"},{"name":"George S.

The nonlinear DAC can implement a piecewise-linear approximation to a sine function and results in significant reduction of complexity and power dissipation when used in direct digital frequency synthesizers (DDFSs). The DDFS look-up table only needs to store offset and gain values for each segment. The look-up table size can be reduced from 11K bits to 544 bits for a 12-bit DDFS with 72 dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). The nonlinear DAC consists of a 12-bit binary-weighted offset DAC and a multiplying DAC. The DACs use a current steering architecture for high-speed operation and the 5 most significant bits of the offset DAC are unary encoded to reduce glitches. The multiplying DAC consists of binary-weighted current sources switched by the partial products of the inputs. Test results show that the DAC has 12-bit accuracy after digital trimming, operates up to 600 MS/s and provides differential outputs of 0.5 V into 50 Omega loads. The SFDR is over 60 dBc below 20 MHz with a maximum of 72 dBc. Radiation tests show the nonlinear DAC can tolerate a total ionizing dose of 200 Krad Si.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.920981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4663192/04472351.pdf","startPage":"2459","endPage":"2468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.920981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 12-Bit Nonlinear DAC for Direct Digital Frequency Synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 12-Bit Nonlinear DAC for Direct Digital Frequency Synthesis","volume":"55","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10347951","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472351/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472351/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 12-Bit Nonlinear DAC for Direct Digital Frequency Synthesis","sourcePdf":"55tcsi09-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068872S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4663192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4663192","articleId":"4472351","onlineDate":"21 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4472379,"authors":[{"name":"JONATHAN P.

Normally, demonstrations of multivehicle coordination and control technologies require that multiple human operators simultaneously manage flight hardware, navigation, control, and vehicle tasking. However, RAVEN simplifies all of these issues to allow researchers to focus, if desired, on the algorithms associated with high-level tasks. Alternatively, RAVEN provides a facility for testing low-level control algorithms on both fixed- and rotary-wing aerial platforms. RAVEN is also being used to analyze and implement techniques for embedding the fleet and vehicle health state (for instance, vehicle failures, refueling, and maintenance) into UAV mission planning. These characteristics facilitate the rapid prototyping of new vehicle configurations and algorithms without requiring a redesign of the vehicle hardware. This article describes the main components and architecture of RAVEN and presents recent flight test results illustrating the applications discussed above.","doi":"10.1109/MCS.2007.914691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/4472219/04472379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2007.914691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4472219","startPage":"51","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time indoor autonomous vehicle test environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time indoor autonomous vehicle test environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9907864","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4472379/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time indoor autonomous vehicle test environment","sourcePdf":"282008-JONATHAN-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042538S","chronDate":"April  2008","isNumber":"4472219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"280","articleId":"4472379","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4472460,"authors":[{"name":"Bipin Rajendran","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

They are used as wavelength converters, optical logic gates, bit comparators and many other all-optical digital signal processing applications. To design the systems, fast and efficient models need be developed considering the basic physics of the SOA. In the present paper, we describe two models that are useful in explaining the high frequency and transient behaviour of SOAs. In the first one, developed by us, the rate equations for photons and carriers in a TW-SOA are suitably tailored so that physical quantities can be replaced by circuit elements like resistors and capacitors and current sources. The equivalent circuit can then be analysed by SPICE simulation. Parasitic elements can easily be included in the model. Satisfactory agreement with available experimental data and results with rigorous transfer matrix method has been obtained. The second model, the reservoir model, developed by Mathlouthi et al based on wideband steady state Connelly model, is useful for predicting the transient and high frequency behavior of SOA-based gates. In our work the reservoir model has been applied to explain the cross gain modulation and gain transient effects for single and WDM signals. It works quite fast to describe the behaviour of long cascades of SOAs. The simulated results agree closely with the experimental results for 1 Gb/s bit stream applied to single and cascaded SOAs and also in WDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/IWPSD.2007.4472512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWPSD.2007.4472512","startPage":"337","endPage":"342","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Physics of Semiconductor Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459058/4472437/04472512.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 International Workshop on Physics of Semiconductor Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4472437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPICE and reservoir models for semiconductor optical amplifiers for high speed optical signal processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"SPICE and reservoir models for semiconductor optical amplifiers for high speed optical signal processing","conferenceDate":"16-20 Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472512/","accessionNumber":"9866795","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472512/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPICE and reservoir models for semiconductor optical amplifiers for high speed optical signal processing","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-03132008-00075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043022S","chronDate":"16-20 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459058","isNumber":"4472437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459058","xplore-issue":"4472437","articleId":"4472512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4472689,"authors":[{"name":"Guangming Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guangming","lastName":"Shi","id":"37267099300"},{"name":"Jie Lin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Lin","id":"38128099500"},{"name":"Xuyang Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xuyang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536414200"},{"name":"Fei Qi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Qi","id":"37404801600"},{"name":"Danhua Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Danhua","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402810100"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280185100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4472689","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2181},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472689","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Sampling methods","Compressed sensing","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Radar detection","Ultra wideband technology","Signal representations","Signal design","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","signal sampling","ultra wideband technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB echo signal detection","ultra-low rate sampling","ultra-wide-band signal processing","compressed sensing theory","sparse representation","matching rules","sparse signal representation","matching basis functions","analog-to-information converter","UWB signal detection system","linear frequency-modulated signal","radar system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog-to-information converter (AIC)","compressed sensing","echo detection","ultra-wide-band (UWB) signal processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.918988","endPage":"383","startPage":"379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4490082/04472689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.918988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UWB Echo Signal Detection With Ultra-Low Rate Sampling Based on Compressed Sensing","abstract":"A major challenge in ultra-wide-band (UWB) signal processing is the requirement for very high sampling rate. The recently emerging compressed sensing (CS) theory makes processing UWB signal at a low sampling rate possible if the signal has a sparse representation in a certain space. Based on the CS theory, a system for sampling UWB echo signal at a rate much lower than Nyquist rate and performing signal detection is proposed in this paper. First, an approach of constructing basis functions according to matching rules is proposed to achieve sparse signal representation because the sparse representation of signal is the most important precondition for the use of CS theory. Second, based on the matching basis functions and using analog-to-information converter, a UWB signal detection system is designed in the framework of the CS theory. With this system, a UWB signal, such as a linear frequency-modulated signal in radar system, can be sampled at about 10% of Nyquist rate, but still can be reconstructed and detected with overwhelming probability. The simulation results show that the proposed method is effective for sampling and detecting UWB signal directly even without a very high-frequency analog-to-digital converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472689/","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4472689/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9921372","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"UWB Echo Signal Detection With Ultra-Low Rate Sampling Based on Compressed Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UWB Echo Signal Detection With Ultra-Low Rate Sampling Based on Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"55tcsii04-shi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096643S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4490082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4490082","articleId":"4472689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4472698,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Guo Lu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun-Guo","lastName":"Lu","id":"37655155800"},{"name":"David J.

Most popular algorithms for multirobot planning manage the complexity of the problem by planning trajectories for robots individually; such decoupled methods are not guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. In contrast, this paper describes a multiphase approach to the planning problem that uses a graph and spanning tree representation to create and maintain obstacle-free paths through the environment for each robot to reach its goal. The resulting algorithm guarantees a solution for a well-defined number of robots in a common environment. The computational cost is shown to be scalable with complexity linear in the number of the robots, and demonstrated by solving the planning problem for 100 robots, simulated in an underground mine environment, in less than 1.5 s with a 1.5 GHz processor. The practicality of the algorithm is demonstrated in a real-world application requiring coordinated motion planning of multiple physical robots.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Complete and Scalable Strategy for Coordinating Multiple Robots Within Roadmaps","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.918056","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4481174/04472723.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.918056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472723/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Complete and Scalable Strategy for Coordinating Multiple Robots Within Roadmaps","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4472723/","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920972","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Complete and Scalable Strategy for Coordinating Multiple Robots Within Roadmaps","sourcePdf":"24tro02-peasgood.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061893S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4481174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4481174","articleId":"4472723","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4472724,"authors":[{"name":"Aurel A.

These algorithms are based on the observation that the recovery of time encoded signals given a finite number of observations has the property that the quality of signal recovery is very high in a reduced time range. We show how to obtain a local representation of the time encoded signal in an efficient and stable manner using a Vandermonde formulation of the recovery algorithm.

They are seen as an integral part of next- generation ubiquitous communication systems. Given the non-uniform distribution of users in satellite footprints, due to several geographical and/or climatic constraints, some Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs) are expected to be heavily loaded with data packets while others remain underutilized. Such scenario obviously leads to congestion of the heavily loaded links. It ultimately results in buffer overflows, higher queuing delays, and significant packet drops. To guarantee a better distribution of traffic among satellites, this paper proposes an explicit exchange of information on congestion status among neighboring satellites. Indeed, a satellite notifies its congestion status to its neighboring satellites. When it is about to get congested, it requests its neighboring satellites to decrease their data forwarding rates by sending them a self status notification signaling message. In response, the neighboring satellites search for less congested paths that do not include the satellite in question and communicate a portion of data, primarily destined to the satellite, via the retrieved paths. This operation avoids both congestion and packet drops at the satellite. It also ensures a better distribution of traffic over the entire satellite constellation. The proposed scheme is dubbed \"Explicit Load Balancing\" (ELB) scheme. While the multi-path routing concept of ELB has many advantages, it may lead to persistent packet reordering. In case of connection-oriented protocols, this phenomenon results in unnecessary shrinkage of the data transmission rate. A solution to this issue is also incorporated in the design of ELB. The interactions of ELB with mechanisms that provide different QoS by differentiating traffic (e.g., Differentiated Services) are also discussed. The good performance of ELB, in terms of better traffic distribution, higher throughput, and lower packet drops, is verified via a set of simulations using the Network Simulator (NS).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472733/","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4472733/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10572990","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Explicit Load Balancing Technique for NGEO Satellite IP Networks With On-Board Processing Capabilities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explicit Load Balancing Technique for NGEO Satellite IP Networks With On-Board Processing Capabilities","sourcePdf":"16tnet00-taleb.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076816S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4785357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4785357","articleId":"4472733","onlineDate":"10 June 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4472743,"authors":[{"name":"He Jian","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Jian","id":"38277835900"},{"name":"Wang Yong-sheng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yong-sheng","id":"38274183000"},{"name":"Wang Jun-hu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Jun-hu","id":"38288111600"},{"name":"Fan Zhong-liang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Zhong-liang","id":"38322440100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-89-960761-1-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-960761-0-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5658"}],"articleNumber":"4472743","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"abstract":"By analyzing the aeronautic channel, it is known the channel has the ability of sparseness.

The algorithm is to gain the order of channel and the place of tap by GAIC. In this algorithm RPC is used as train sequence to reduce the complexity and computation. The simulation proves the algorithm needs less resources and calculation and the error of estimation is remarkably reduced.

The cognitive radio device is allowed to use the spectrum only when it does not cause any interferences or collisions to the incumbent users. We suggest an adaptive MAC protocol for the purpose of a throughput enhancement in cognitive radio networks. Assuming the channel status is dynamically known to the devices, they change their transmission mode between frame recovery mode and dual transmit mode according to the channel status. When the cognitive channel is hard to use due to frame errors, the channel is used for the frame errors recovery. Otherwise, in addition to its own legacy channel, the cognitive channel can be used to increase the throughput. In this paper, we study the effect of using additional channel in the cognitive networks, and prove an adaptive method of MAC protocol in the interest of throughput enhancement in cognitive radio network, and prove the performance of our proposed mechanism by simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472832/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9940663","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","conferenceDate":"23-25 Jan. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472832/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MAC Protocol for Throughput Enhancement in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MAC Protocol for Throughput Enhancement in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"ICOIN08-00-95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056631S","chronDate":"23-25 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470165","isNumber":"4472737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470165","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4472737","articleId":"4472832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Korean Inst. of Information, Scientists & Engineers","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4472834,"authors":[{"name":"Peter M.

Since this is a quite limiting assumption, a general analytic formula is given here for the spectrum of stochastic antipodal processes with finite memory m ges 1. The formula is derived within a generalized Markov framework and depends on the eigenstructure of a suitably defined transition matrix that is also exploited to give ergodicity conditions. The complexity of the overall analysis depends on the size of such matrix which is exponential in m. Within that framework a slightly less general but more tractable scheme for the generation of antipodal processes with prescribed spectral profile is introduced leveraging on a linear probability feedback. For such a scheme, whose complexity is linear in m, an alternative spectrum formula is derived as well as a synthesis procedure going from spectrum specification to feedback filter design. Both the general case and the linear probability feedback scheme are exemplified in some special cases.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.920986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4774051/04472849.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.920986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4774051","startPage":"156","endPage":"167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory-m antipodal processes: Spectral analysis and synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Memory-m antipodal processes: Spectral analysis and synthesis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472849/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470348","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory-m antipodal processes: Spectral analysis and synthesis","sourcePdf":"56tcsi01-rovatti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043035S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","isNumber":"4774051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"32","articleId":"4472849","onlineDate":"21 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4472852,"authors":[{"name":"Jingsong Xia","affiliation":["Broadtune Corporation, Hawthorne Woods, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jingsong","lastName":"Xia","id":"37826926500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"4472852","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Low pass filters","Band pass filters","Signal processing","Equalizers","Frequency synchronization","Matched filters","Signal generators","Phase detection","RF signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","synchronisation","television receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock recovery scheme","ATSC receiver","field sync signal","distorted channel condition","television receiver","advanced television system committee"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clock synchronization","correlation","phase detection"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a method of using the field sync signal to perform clock recovery for ATSC receivers.

In 2006 alone, 2705 people were killed due to fire in building structures. 74% of the deaths result from fires in homes with no smoke alarms or no working smoke alarms while surveys report that 96% of all homes have at least one smoke alarm. This study discusses the development of a fire sensing system that is not only capable of detecting fire in its early stage but also of classifying the fire based on the smell of the smoke in the environment. By using an array of sensors along with a neural network for sensor pattern recognition, an impressive result is obtained. Instead of confining the ANN to a PC based application, this work extends the implementation of the neural network fire classifier in a general purpose microcontroller. The result is a low cost intelligent embedded fire classifier that can be used in real life situations for fire hazards minimization, for example this intelligent fire classifier can be used for the development of a smart extinguisher that detects the fire, classifies it and then uses appropriate extinguishing material required for extinguishing the particular class of fire.","doi":"10.1109/SAS13374.2008.4472960","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4467054/4472923/04472960.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4472923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAS13374.2008.4472960","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium","startPage":"146","endPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded neural network for fire classification using an array of gas sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4472960","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Embedded neural network for fire classification using an array of gas sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472960/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4472960/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9882816","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","conferenceDate":"12-14 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded neural network for fire classification using an array of gas sensors","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-03142008-00037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047853S","chronDate":"12-14 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4467054","isNumber":"4472923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4467054","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4472923","articleId":"4472960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4472998,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Sayadi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Tehran, IR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4603151/4472998/4472998-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Omid Sayadi (S\u201906) was born in Shiraz, Iran, in 1983.

We have used a previously introduced two-dimensional EKF structure and modified its governing equations to be extended to a 17-dimensional case. The new EKF structure is used not only for denoising, but also for compression, since it provides estimation for each of the new 15 model parameters. Using these specific parameters, the signal is reconstructed with regard to the dynamical equations of the model. The performances of the proposed method are evaluated using standard denoising and compression efficiency measures. For denosing, the SNR improvement criterion is used, while for compression, we have considered the compression ratio (CR), the percentage area difference (PAD), and the weighted diagnostic distortion (WDD) measure. Several Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (MIT-BIH) ECG databases are used for performance evaluation. Simulation results illustrate that both applications can contribute to and enhance the clinical ECG data denoising and compression performance. For denoising, an average SNR improvement of 10.16 dB was achieved, which is 1.8 dB more than the next benchmark methods such as MAB WT or EKF2. For compression, the algorithm was extended to include more than five Gaussian kernels. Results show a typical average CR of 11.37:1 with WDD < 1.73 %. Consequently, the proposed framework is suitable for a hybrid system that integrates these algorithmic approaches for clean ECG data storage or transmission scenarios with high output SNRs, high CRs, and low distortions.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.921150","startPage":"2240","endPage":"2248","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.921150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4603151/04472998.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG Denoising and Compression Using a Modified Extended Kalman Filter Structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4472998/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ECG Denoising and Compression Using a Modified Extended Kalman Filter Structure","volume":"55","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4472998/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10158535","pubMedId":"18713693","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG Denoising and Compression Using a Modified Extended Kalman Filter Structure","sourcePdf":"55tbme09-sayadi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109022S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4603151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"4603151","articleId":"4472998","onlineDate":"21 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4473034,"authors":[{"name":"Gijo Augustin","affiliation":["Centre for Research in Electromagnetics and Antennas (CREMA), Department of Electronics, Cochin University of Science and Technology, Cochin, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Gijo","lastName":"Augustin","id":"37563724000"},{"name":"P.

Second, CSP has been initially proposed for two-class paradigms. Extensions to multiclass paradigms have been suggested, but are based on heuristics. We address these shortcomings in the framework of information theoretic feature extraction (ITFE). We show that for two-class paradigms, CSP maximizes an approximation of mutual information of extracted EEG/MEG components and class labels. This establishes a link between CSP and the minimal classification error. For multiclass paradigms, we point out that CSP by joint approximate diagonalization (JAD) is equivalent to independent component analysis (ICA), and provide a method to choose those independent components (ICs) that approximately maximize mutual information of ICs and class labels. This eliminates the need for heuristics in multiclass CSP, and allows incorporating prior class probabilities. The proposed method is applied to the dataset IIIa of the third BCI competition, and is shown to increase the mean classification accuracy by 23.4% in comparison to multiclass CSP.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4567608/04473042.pdf","startPage":"1991","endPage":"2000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.921154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.921154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4567608","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4473042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiclass Common Spatial Patterns and Information Theoretic Feature Extraction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Electroencephalography","Spatial filters","Data mining","Magnetic separation","Filtering","Magnetoencephalography","Mutual information","Independent component analysis","Magnetic field measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","feature extraction","independent component analysis","magnetoencephalography","medical image processing","spatial filters","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["common spatial patterns","brain-computer interface","electroencephalography","magnetoencephalography","EEG","MEG","information theoretic feature extraction","joint approximate diagonalization","independent component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain-computer interfaces","common spatial patterns","information theoretic feature extraction","spatial filtering"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Brain Mapping","Electroencephalography","Humans","Magnetoencephalography","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4473042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass Common Spatial Patterns and Information Theoretic Feature Extraction","volume":"55","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4473042/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10115001","pubMedId":"18632362","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass Common Spatial Patterns and Information Theoretic Feature Extraction","sourcePdf":"55tbme08-grossewentrup.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054289S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4567608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"4567608","articleId":"4473042","onlineDate":"21 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":4473049,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In fact, this study shows that the best robustness and performances are always obtained with the stabilizer configuration using the signals recommended by the geometric approach. In addition, the results confirm that wide-area control is more effective than local control for damping inter-area oscillations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4473100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4473100/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922154","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of Two Methods to Select Wide-Area Signals for Power System Damping Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of Two Methods to Select Wide-Area Signals for Power System Damping Control","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs02-heniche.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073533S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4494587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4494587","articleId":"4473100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4473103,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hua Zhao","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Saint Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["JunHua Zhao (S'05) received the bachelor degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2003 and Ph.D. degree from the University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia, in 2007.","He is now a postdoctoral research fellow at the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland.

Rather than forecasting the value, market participants are sometimes more interested in forecasting the prediction interval of the electricity price. Forecasting the prediction interval is essential for estimating the uncertainty involved in the price and thus is highly useful for making generation bidding strategies and investment decisions. In this paper, a novel data mining-based approach is proposed to achieve two major objectives: 1) to accurately forecast the value of the electricity price series, which is widely accepted as a nonlinear time series; 2) to accurately estimate the prediction interval of the electricity price series. In the proposed approach, support vector machine (SVM) is employed to forecast the value of the price. To forecast the prediction interval, we construct a statistical model by introducing a heteroscedastic variance equation for the SVM. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is used to estimate model parameters. Results from the case studies on real-world price data prove that the proposed method is highly effective compared with existing methods such as GARCH models.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919309","startPage":"267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4494587/04473103.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919309","endPage":"276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Approach for Interval Forecasting of the Electricity Price","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4473103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Approach for Interval Forecasting of the Electricity Price","volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4473103/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9922190","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Approach for Interval Forecasting of the Electricity Price","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs02-zhao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071045S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4494587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"4494587","articleId":"4473103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4473360,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Li Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2007.","He is currently with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University.

The MEMS device consists of two identical freestanding polymer diaphragms, resistive heaters, and a thermopile between the diaphragms. Integrated with polymer-based microfluidic measurement chambers, the device allows sensitive measurement of small volumes of liquid samples. Enzymes specific to a metabolic analyte system are immobilized on microbeads packed in the chambers. When a sample solution containing the analyte is introduced to the device, the heat released from the enzymatic reactions of the analyte is detected by the thermopile. The device has been tested with glucose solutions at physiologically relevant concentrations. In flow-injection mode, the device demonstrates a sensitivity of approximately 2.1 muV/mM and a resolution of about 0.025 mM. In flow-through mode with a perfusion flow rate of 0.5 mL/h, the sensitivity and resolution of the device are determined to be approximately 0.24 muV/mM and 0.4 mM, respectively. These results illustrate that the device, when integrated with subcutaneous sampling methods, can potentially allow for continuous monitoring of glucose and other metabolites.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4473360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4473360/","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921033","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A MEMS Thermal Biosensor for Metabolic Monitoring Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MEMS Thermal Biosensor for Metabolic Monitoring Applications","sourcePdf":"17jmems02-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072914S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4481154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4481154","articleId":"4473360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4474108,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher A.

RCV consists of the following two components: a new slack-allocation algorithm that determines both a minimum and a maximum delay budget for each circuit connection and a new router that strives to meet and, if possible, surpass these connection-delay constraints. RCV improves both long- and short-path timing slacks significantly versus an earlier computer-aided design system, showing the importance of an integrated approach that simultaneously optimizes considering both types of timing constraints. It is able to meet long- and short-path timing constraints on all 157 peripheral component interconnect cores tested, while an earlier algorithm failed to achieve timing on 75% of the cores. Even in cases where there are no short-path timing constraints, RCV outperforms a state-of-the-art FPGA router and improves the maximum clock speed of circuits by an average of 3.2% (and up to 24.7%).","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.917585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4475241/04475248.pdf","startPage":"686","endPage":"697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.917585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475248","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slack Allocation and Routing to Improve FPGA Timing While Repairing Short-Path Violations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475248/","displayDocTitle":"Slack Allocation and Routing to Improve FPGA Timing While Repairing Short-Path Violations","volume":"27","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475248/","publicationDate":"April 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920484","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slack Allocation and Routing to Improve FPGA Timing While Repairing Short-Path Violations","sourcePdf":"27tcad04-fung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062609S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4475241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4475241","articleId":"4475248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4475253,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Wei Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4475241/4475253/4475253-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nChung-Wei Lin received the B.S. degree in computer science and information engineering and the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2005 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently in the military service.

The OARSMT problem becomes more important than ever for modern nanometer IC designs which need to consider numerous routing obstacles incurred from power networks, prerouted nets, IP blocks, feature patterns for manufacturability improvement, antenna jumpers for reliability enhancement, etc. Consequently, the OARSMT problem has received dramatically increasing attention recently. Nevertheless, considering obstacles significantly increases the problem complexity, and thus, most previous works suffer from either poor quality or expensive running time. Based on the obstacle-avoiding spanning graph, this paper presents an efficient algorithm with some theoretical optimality guarantees for the OARSMT construction. Unlike previous heuristics, our algorithm guarantees to find an optimal OARSMT for any two-pin net and many higher pin nets. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm results in significantly shorter wirelengths than all state-of-the-art works.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle-Avoiding Rectilinear Steiner Tree Construction Based on Spanning Graphs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.917583","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4475241/04475253.pdf","startPage":"643","endPage":"653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.917583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475253/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Obstacle-Avoiding Rectilinear Steiner Tree Construction Based on Spanning Graphs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4475253/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920489","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle-Avoiding Rectilinear Steiner Tree Construction Based on Spanning Graphs","sourcePdf":"27tcad04-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083373S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4475241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4475241","articleId":"4475253","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4475254,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitri Maslov","affiliation":["Department of Combinatorics and Optimization and the Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4475241/4475254/4475254-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dmitri Maslov received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Lomonosov's Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia, in 2000, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada, in 2002 and 2003, respectively.","He is a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Combinatorics and Optimization and the Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.

Code-compression techniques address this issue by reducing the code size of application programs. It is a major challenge to develop an efficient code-compression technique that can generate substantial reduction in code size without affecting the overall system performance. We present a novel code-compression technique using bitmasks, which significantly improves the compression efficiency without introducing any decompression penalty. This paper makes three important contributions. 1) It develops an efficient bitmask-selection technique that can create a large set of matching patterns. 2) It develops an efficient dictionary-selection technique based on bitmasks. 3) It proposes a dictionary-based code-compression algorithm using the bitmask- and dictionary-selection techniques that can significantly reduce the memory requirement. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we have performed code compression using applications from various domains and compiled for a wide variety of architectures. Our approach outperforms the existing dictionary-based techniques by an average of 20%, giving a compression ratio of 55%-65%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4475241/04475257.pdf","startPage":"673","endPage":"685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2008.917563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2008.917563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475241","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bitmask-Based Code Compression for Embedded Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Embedded system","Chromium","System performance","Pattern matching","Costs","Dictionaries","Power dissipation","Memory management","Size measurement","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","dictionaries","embedded systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bitmask","code compression","embedded systems","substantial reduction","matching patterns","dictionary-selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bitmasks","code compression","decompression","embedded systems","memory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Bitmask-Based Code Compression for Embedded Systems","volume":"27","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4475257/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920491","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bitmask-Based Code Compression for Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"27tcad04-seong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077166S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4475241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4475241","articleId":"4475257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4475273,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this paper, we propose a dual-stage servo system using enhanced active-passive hybrid piezoelectric actuators. Because they incorporate passive damping, the proposed actuators will improve the existing dual-stage actuators, giving them higher precision and better shock resistance. We report finite-element analyses of different types of piezoelectric actuators in a disk arm assembly under external shock and vibration. We modeled the viscoelastic damping layers in the hybrid actuators with the Prony series, whose parameters we determined from the dynamic frequency data of a nomograph. In the analyses, a shock impulse (175 g, 1 ms half sine) and a vibration impulse (350 g and 1 ms full sine) are applied at one end of the base, while the other end of the base is fixed. We evaluated and compared the responses of the disk arm assembly with different configurations of the piezoelectric actuators. The simulation results show that the enhanced active-passive hybrid actuator design would reduce the residual in-plane vibration induced during the shock, resist liftoff motion, and reduce the impact damage when the head slaps.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4475322/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920374","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Shock Resistance of a Disk-Drive Assembly Using Piezoelectric Actuators With Passive Damping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shock Resistance of a Disk-Drive Assembly Using Piezoelectric Actuators With Passive Damping","sourcePdf":"44tmag04-chan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06789S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4475318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4475318","articleId":"4475322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-18"},{"_id":4475325,"authors":[{"name":"John T.

The method converges stably with a slow rate, exactly opposite to the Newton-Raphson method, which can easily suffer from instability, but which, if it converges, does so remarkably fast. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of the fixed-point method, examine the barriers behind the slow convergence, and show how to overcome them. The analysis has proved fruitful and provided sound techniques for speeding up the convergence of the fixed-point method. We have given special attention to the 2D and 3D problems and devised a general formula for the fastest convergence. We used a time-stepping finite-element formulation to test the convergence of the fixed-point method and compare it to the Newton-Raphson method. We investigated certain factors including the time-step size in magnetic field simulations of two rotating electrical machines.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the Convergence of the Fixed-Point Method Used for Solving Nonlinear Rotational Magnetic Field Problems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.914888","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4475318/04475329.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.914888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475329/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Convergence of the Fixed-Point Method Used for Solving Nonlinear Rotational Magnetic Field Problems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4475329/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920377","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Convergence of the Fixed-Point Method Used for Solving Nonlinear Rotational Magnetic Field Problems","sourcePdf":"44tmag04-dlala.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121668S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4475318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4475318","articleId":"4475329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4475331,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet Keskinoz","affiliation":[" Electronics Engineering Program, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Keskinoz","id":"37268996100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4475331","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intersymbol interference","Bit error rate","Decision feedback equalizers","Memory","Degradation","Magnetic noise","System performance","Mean square error methods","Viterbi algorithm","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intersymbol interference","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","magnetic recording","magnetic storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D detection","patterned media storage","ultrahigh-capacity magnetic data storage","bit error rate performance","2D intersymbol interference","intertrack interference","iterative decision feedback detection","2D generalized partial response equalization","minimum mean square error","1D Viterbi algorithm","storage density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intersymbol interference","patterned media","two-dimensional equalization/detection"]}],"abstract":"Although patterned media storage (PMS) is a promising candidate for ultrahigh-capacity magnetic data storage, as the capacity of PMS increases, the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system is degraded by increased two-dimensional intersymbol interference (2D-ISI), which results from intertrack interference (ITI), intersymbol interference (ISI), and noise. To improve the system performance under these adverse effects and to increase the capacity, in this paper, we propose to use and/or devise two-dimensional equalization/detection techniques: iterative decision feedback detection (IDFD) and two-dimensional generalized partial response equalization, which is optimized in minimum mean square error (MMSE), followed by one-dimensional Viterbi algorithm (2D-GPR/1D-VA). We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods by using numerical experiments under different amounts of 2D-ISI and noise. Simulation results suggest that under high storage density, the performance of the IDFD is improved by using more iterations and that under the same computational load, 2D-GPR/1D-VA performs better than IDFD. 2D-GPR/1D-VA, therefore, is a good candidate for ultrahigh-capacity PMS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional Equalization/Detection for Patterned Media Storage","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.914966","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4475318/04475331.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.914966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475331/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Equalization/Detection for Patterned Media Storage","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4475331/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920378","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Equalization/Detection for Patterned Media Storage","sourcePdf":"44tmag04-keskinoz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056081S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4475318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4475318","articleId":"4475331","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4475339,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Varsamou","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich Research Laboratory, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Varsamou","id":"37276937700"},{"name":"Theodore Antonakopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computers Engineering, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Theodore","lastName":"Antonakopoulos","id":"37276921000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4475339","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Atomic force microscopy","Magnetic materials","Magnetic properties","Sensor arrays","Interleaved codes","Holography","Optical materials","Mechanical factors","Ferroelectric materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","magnetic storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data allocation method","parallel probe-based storage devices","parallel data fields","storage fields","allocation round","storage efficiency improvement","atomic force microscopy","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data allocation","interleaving","probe storage","Reed\u2013Solomon codes"]}],"abstract":"We present a new data allocation method for probe-based storage devices that use multiple, simultaneously accessed parallel data fields.

A great deal of research for improving PTOS has been reported; however, most of it is complex or needs a time-consuming tuning process. Damping scheduling PTOS (DSPTOS), which maintained the simplicity of PTOS and showed faster settling in long strokes by scheduling a closed-loop damping coefficient, was proposed previously. In this paper, we propose a modified DSPTOS which can schedule a closed-loop damping coefficient not only in long strokes, but also in short strokes. The proposed algorithm improves seek and settling performances significantly in short strokes. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through simulations and real-time experiments. Consequently, we achieved over a 25% settling time improvement for a short stroke (10 tracks).","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.918826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.918826","startPage":"540","endPage":"546","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4475318/04475341.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Damping Scheduling Proximate Time Optimal Servomechanism for Improvements in Short Strokes in Hard Disk Drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Modified Damping Scheduling Proximate Time Optimal Servomechanism for Improvements in Short Strokes in Hard Disk Drives","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475341/","accessionNumber":"9920386","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475341/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Damping Scheduling Proximate Time Optimal Servomechanism for Improvements in Short Strokes in Hard Disk Drives","sourcePdf":"44tmag04-ymchoi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047192S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4475318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4475318","articleId":"4475341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4475350,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This paper discusses the use of GPR frequency-domain spectral features to improve the detection of weak-scattering plastic mines and to reduce the number of false alarms resulting from clutter. The motivation for this approach comes from the fact that landmine targets and clutter objects often have different shapes and/or composition, yielding different energy density spectrum (EDS) that may be exploited for their discrimination (this information is also present in time-domain data, but in the frequency domain we can remove a phase if desired and can reveal better spatial characteristics and therefore often achieve greater robustness). This paper first applies the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling technique to establish the theoretical foundation. The method to generate EDS from GPR measurements is then described. The consistency of the frequency-domain features is examined through two different GPRs that have different spatial sampling rates and frequency bandwidths. Experimental results from several test sites, based on GPR data collected over buried mines and emplaced buried clutter objects, corroborate the theoretical development and the effectiveness of the proposed spectral feature to increase the accuracy of landmine detection and discrimination.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.915747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475343","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4475343/04475350.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Investigation of Using the Spectral Characteristics From Ground Penetrating Radar for Landmine/Clutter Discrimination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4475350/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Investigation of Using the Spectral Characteristics From Ground Penetrating Radar for Landmine/Clutter Discrimination","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920354","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation of Using the Spectral Characteristics From Ground Penetrating Radar for Landmine/Clutter Discrimination","sourcePdf":"46tgrs04-ho-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119407S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4475343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4475343","articleId":"4475350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4475354,"authors":[{"name":"Kambiz Azarian","affiliation":["Qualcomm Incorporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kambiz","lastName":"Azarian","id":"37295966200"},{"name":"Hesham El Gamal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Hesham","lastName":"El Gamal","id":"37273282800"},{"name":"Philip Schniter","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Schniter","id":"37271304700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4475354","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access protocols","Relays","Automatic repeat request","Decoding","OFDM modulation","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Performance analysis","Upper bound","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","automatic repeat request","diversity reception","multi-access systems","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ARQ-DDF protocol","automatic repeat request","dynamic decode and forward cooperation protocol","multiple access relay channel","diversity multiplexing tradeoff","cooperative vector multiple access channel","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic repeat request (ARQ)","cooperative diversity","cooperative vector multiple-access (CVMA) channel","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT)","dynamic decode and forward (DDF)","half-duplex node","multiple-access relay (MAR) channel"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, the performance of the automatic repeat request-dynamic decode and forward (ARQ-DDF) cooperation protocol is analyzed in two distinct scenarios. The first scenario is the multiple access relay channel where a single relay is dedicated to simultaneously help two multiple access users. For this setup, it is shown that the ARQ-DDF protocol achieves the channel's optimal diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The second scenario is the cooperative vector multiple access channel where two users cooperate in delivering their messages to a destination equipped with two receiving antennas. For this setup, a new variant of the ARQ-DDF protocol is developed where the two users are purposefully instructed not to cooperate in the first round of transmission. Lower and upper bounds on the achievable DMT are then derived. These bounds are shown to converge to the optimal tradeoff as the number of transmission rounds increases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Optimality of the ARQ-DDF Protocol","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.917722","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4475352/04475354.pdf","startPage":"1718","endPage":"1724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.917722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Optimality of the ARQ-DDF Protocol","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4475354/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9943622","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Optimality of the ARQ-DDF Protocol","sourcePdf":"54tit04-azarian-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050106S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4475352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4475352","articleId":"4475354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4475356,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00d6rgen Cederlof","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden","Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"J\u00d6rgen","lastName":"Cederlof","id":"37085941954"},{"name":"Jan-\u00c5ke Larsson","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jan-\u00c5ke","lastName":"Larsson","id":"37597529500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4475356","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1110},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475356","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Cryptography","Quantum mechanics","Optical fibers","Message authentication","Mathematics","Access protocols","Stress measurement","Mechanical factors","Mechanical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message authentication","quantum cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum cryptography authentication","secure message authentication","quantum channel","authentication security weakness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Authentication","quantum cryptography (QC)","quantum key distribution","quantum key growing (QKG)"]}],"abstract":"Unconditionally secure message authentication is an important part of quantum cryptography (QC). In this correspondence, we analyze security effects of using a key obtained from QC for authentication purposes in later rounds of QC. In particular, the eavesdropper gains partial knowledge on the key in QC that may have an effect on the security of the authentication in the later round. Our initial analysis indicates that this partial knowledge has little effect on the authentication part of the system, in agreement with previous results on the issue. However, when taking the full QC protocol into account, the picture is different. By accessing the quantum channel used in QC, the attacker can change the message to be authenticated. This, together with partial knowledge of the key, does incur a security weakness of the authentication. The underlying reason for this is that the authentication used, which is insensitive to such message changes when the key is unknown, becomes sensitive when used with a partially known key. We suggest a simple solution to this problem, and stress usage of this or an equivalent extra security measure in QC.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.917697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4475352/04475356.pdf","startPage":"1735","endPage":"1741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.917697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security Aspects of the Authentication Used in Quantum Cryptography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Security Aspects of the Authentication Used in Quantum Cryptography","volume":"54","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9943624","htmlLink":"/document/4475356/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Aspects of the Authentication Used in Quantum Cryptography","sourcePdf":"54tit04-cederlof-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064041S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4475352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4475352","articleId":"4475356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4475358,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280675700"},{"name":"Toby Berger","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Toby","lastName":"Berger","id":"37275040200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4475358","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475358","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Sufficient conditions","Quantization","Multiaccess communication","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wyner-Ziv coding","quadratic Gaussian CEO problem","distributed source coding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CEO problem","contra-polymatroid","rate splitting","source splitting","successive refinement","Wyner\u2013Ziv coding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a distributed source coding scheme called successive Wyner-Ziv coding.

In order to quantify LP decoding it is important to study vertexes of the relaxed polytope, so-called pseudocodewords. We propose a technique to heuristcally create a list of pseudocodewords close to the zero codeword and their distances. Our pseudocodeword-search algorithm starts by randomly choosing configuration of the noise. The configuration is modified through a discrete number of steps. Each step consists of two substeps: one applies an LP decoder to the noise-configuration deriving a pseudocodeword, and then finds configuration of the noise equidistant from the pseudocodeword and the zero codeword. The resulting noise configuration is used as an entry for the next step. The iterations converge rapidly to a pseudocodeword neighboring the zero codeword. Repeated many times, this procedure is characterized by the distribution function of the pseudocodeword effective distance. The efficiency of the procedure is demonstrated on examples of the Tanner code and Margulis codes operating over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.917682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4475352/04475359.pdf","startPage":"1514","endPage":"1520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.917682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Pseudocodeword Search Algorithm for Linear Programming Decoding of LDPC Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Pseudocodeword Search Algorithm for Linear Programming Decoding of LDPC Codes","volume":"54","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9943627","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475359/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475359/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Pseudocodeword Search Algorithm for Linear Programming Decoding of LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"54tit04-chertkov.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041471S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4475352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4475352","articleId":"4475359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-15"},{"_id":4475361,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron S.

At the same time, like in the AWGN case, the zero-interference capacity grows without bound with the input constraint. Thus almost 100% of the available capacity is lost in WDP in the presence of difference-set noise. This high capacity loss is due to the ldquoentropy amplification propertyrdquo (EAP) of noise with an aperiodic probability distribution. Using the EAP and the duality between WDP and Wyner-Ziv source coding, we also give an example of dramatic rate-loss in quantizing encrypted source.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.917675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.917675","startPage":"1477","endPage":"1487","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4475352/04475361.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entropy Amplification Property and the Loss for Writing on Dirty Paper","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Entropy Amplification Property and the Loss for Writing on Dirty Paper","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","volume":"54","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475361/","accessionNumber":"9943629","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475361/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entropy Amplification Property and the Loss for Writing on Dirty Paper","sourcePdf":"54tit04-cohen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084188S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4475352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4475352","articleId":"4475361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4475365,"authors":[{"name":"Onkar Dabeer","affiliation":["School of Technology and Computer Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Onkar","lastName":"Dabeer","id":"37284182100"},{"name":"Elias Masry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Masry","id":"37294022900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4475365","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Quantization","Maximum likelihood estimation","Autoregressive processes","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Signal processing","Materials science and technology","Direction of arrival estimation","Frequency estimation","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","covariance matrices","Gaussian noise","parameter estimation","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariate signal parameter estimation","dependent noise","1-bit dithered quantized data","sensor networks","autoregressive moving average models","ARMA models","Gaussian noise","asymptotic mean matrices","covariance matrices","word length 1 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["1-bit dithered quantization","dependent data","sensor networks","signal parameters estimation"]}],"abstract":"Motivated by applications in sensor networks and communications, we consider multivariate signal parameter estimation when only dithered 1-bit quantized samples are available.

It turned out that the mismatched filter of a quadriphase Barker code with 15 elements (1, 1, 1, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</i>\n, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</i>\n, 1, - \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</i>\n, - \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</i>\n, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</i>\n, -1, - \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</i>\n, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j</i>\n, 1, -1, 1) has a loss in SNR of only 6.7% when compared with the corresponding matched filter. The mismatched filter of the well known 13-element Barker code, which has a loss in SNR of 4.8%, outperforms this filter. Finally, using numerical experiment it is shown that a randomly selected long code will most likely have very large SNR losses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4475366/","accessionNumber":"9943631","displayDocTitle":"Mismatched Filtering of Aperiodic Quadriphase Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mismatched Filtering of Aperiodic Quadriphase Codes","sourcePdf":"54tit04-damtie-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074109S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4475352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4475352","articleId":"4475366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4475368,"authors":[{"name":"Heide Gluesing-Luerssen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Heide","lastName":"Gluesing-Luerssen","id":"38277131000"},{"name":"Gert Schneider","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Groningam, Groningen, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Gert","lastName":"Schneider","id":"38276557500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4475368","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"The adjacency matrix associated with a convolutional code collects in a detailed manner information about the weight distribution of the code.

These results are then used to construct universal limited-delay schemes for lossy coding of individual sequences. In particular, we consider the problem of tracking the best scalar quantizer that is adaptively matched to the source sequence with piecewise different behavior. A randomized algorithm is presented which can perform, on any source sequence, asymptotically as well as the best scalar quantization algorithm that is matched to the sequence and is allowed to change the employed quantizer for a given number of times. The complexity of the algorithm is quadratic in the sequence length, but at the price of some deterioration in performance, the complexity can be made linear. Analogous results are obtained for sequential multiresolution and multiple description scalar quantization of individual sequences.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4475352/04475369.pdf","startPage":"1604","endPage":"1625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.917651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.917651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking the Best Quantizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Source coding","Automatic control","Decoding","Councils","Scholarships","Technological innovation","Materials science and technology","Information theory","Australia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","directed graphs","quantisation (signal)","randomised algorithms","sequences","sequential codes","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graph","lossy source coding","universal limited-delay scheme","randomized algorithm","computational complexity","individual sequences","sequential multiresolution coding","multiple description scalar quantization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithmic efficiency","individual sequences","lossy source coding","multiple description quantization","multi resolution coding","nonstationary sources","scalar quantization","sequential coding","sequential prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Tracking the Best Quantizer","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4475369/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9943634","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking the Best Quantizer","sourcePdf":"54tit04-gyorgy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113115S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4475352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4475352","articleId":"4475369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4475370,"authors":[{"name":"Junsheng Han","affiliation":["Center for Magnetic Recording Research, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Junsheng","lastName":"Han","id":"37832076300"},{"name":"Paul H.

The goal is to find the optimal balance between the increased data rate provided by antenna multiplexing, the reduction in transmission errors provided by antenna diversity and automatic repeat request (ARQ), and the delay introduced by ARQ. First, closed-form analytical results are developed to minimize end-to-end distortion of a vector quantizer concatenated with a space-time MIMO channel code in the high SNR regime. The minimization determines the optimal point on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff curve. For large but finite SNR this optimal point is found via convex optimization, which is illustrated with an example of a practical joint source-channel code design. It is then shown that for MIMO systems with ARQ retransmission, sources without a delay constraint have distortion minimized by maximizing the ARQ window size. This results in a new multiplexing-diversity tradeoff region enhanced by ARQ. However, under a source delay constraint the problem formulation changes to account for delay distortion associated with random message arrival and random ARQ completion times. In this case, the simplifications associated with a high SNR assumption break down, and a dynamic programming formulation is required to capture the channel diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as well as the random arrival and retransmission dynamics. Results based on this formulation show that a delay-sensitive system obtains significant performance gains by adapting its operating point on the diversity-multiplexing-delay region to system dynamics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Source and Channel Coding for MIMO Systems: Is it Better to be Robust or Quick?","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.917725","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4475352/04475371.pdf","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.917725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint Source and Channel Coding for MIMO Systems: Is it Better to be Robust or Quick?","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4475371/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9943636","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Source and Channel Coding for MIMO Systems: Is it Better to be Robust or Quick?","sourcePdf":"54tit04-holliday.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0828S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4475352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4475352","articleId":"4475371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4475372,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon Hombs","affiliation":["BAE Systems Advanced Systems and Technologies, Merrimack, NH, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Hombs","id":"37274916800"},{"name":"James S.

Assuming that the channel matrix is drawn with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) real-valued Gaussian entries, we study the receiver diversity and prove that the SDR detector achieves the maximum possible diversity. Thus, the error probability of the receiver tends to zero at the same rate as the optimal ML receiver in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limit. This significantly strengthens previous performance guarantees available for the semidefinite relaxation detector. Additionally, it proves that full diversity detection is also possible in certain scenarios when using a noncombinatorial receiver structure.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4475352/04475373.pdf","startPage":"1406","endPage":"1422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Diversity Order of the Semidefinite Relaxation Detector","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.917634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.917634","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"The Diversity Order of the Semidefinite Relaxation Detector","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9943638","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4475373/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Diversity Order of the Semidefinite Relaxation Detector","sourcePdf":"54tit04-jalden.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123623S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4475352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4475352","articleId":"4475373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4475377,"authors":[{"name":"Jeong W.

Our approach is also described from the perspective of statistical mechanics, as the graphical model and inference algorithm have their analogues in physics. Our experimental study, based on common channel settings taken from cellular networks and magnetic recording devices, demonstrates that under nontrivial memory conditions, the performance of this fully tractable GBP estimator is almost identical to the performance of the optimal MAP estimator. It also enables a practically accurate simulation-based estimate of the information rate.

A transmitter with channel knowledge can achieve this capacity by a combination of eigenbeamforming and water-filling; the eigenbeamforming transforms the MIMO-OFDM channel into a parallel bank of scalar channels, and the water-filling procedure optimally allocates rate and energy to the scalar channels - a form of adaptive modulation. This paper shows that the water-filling procedure is not necessary to approach the zero-outage capacity of the MIMO-OFDM channel; it is sufficient instead to use a combination of eigenbeamforming and a fixed (nonadaptive) rate allocation. The fixed allocation depends only on the statistics of the channel and is independent of the particular channel realization. This paper proves that the capacity penalty incurred by the fixed allocation approaches zero as the number of antennas grows large. Numerical results indicate that the convergence is fast; for example, the fixed allocation suffers an SNR penalty of less than 0.2 dB for a 6-input 6-output Rayleigh-fading MIMO-OFDM channel at 8 bits per signaling interval, when the channel is assumed to be uncorrelated between antennas and between channel taps. A main conclusion is that eigenbeamforming is the most valuable way to exploit knowledge of the channel at the transmitter, and that any subsequent adaptive modulation has minimal relative value.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2008.917698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4475352/04475390.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2008.917698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475352","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaching the Zero-Outage Capacity of MIMO-OFDM Without Instantaneous Water-Filling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approaching the Zero-Outage Capacity of MIMO-OFDM Without Instantaneous Water-Filling","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475390/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9943652","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4475390/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaching the Zero-Outage Capacity of MIMO-OFDM Without Instantaneous Water-Filling","sourcePdf":"54tit04-sung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098782S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4475352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4475352","articleId":"4475390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4475392,"authors":[{"name":"Haiquan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Haiquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280092800"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4475392","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Block codes","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Constellation diagram","Signal generators","MIMO","Geometry","Transmitting antennas","Signal design","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","Gaussian processes","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal normalized diversity product","lattice-based diagonal space-time codes","QAM signal constellations","block codes","Gaussian integer signal constellations","quadratic algebraic extensions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algebraic extension","Gaussian integers","geometry of numbers","lattice-based space\u2013time block codes","normalized diversity product"]}],"abstract":"In this correspondence, we prove that the optimal normalized diversity product of lattice-based diagonal space-time block codes with Gaussian integer (or QAM) signal constellations, i.e., , and any generating matrices of complex entries (not necessarily algebraic extensions of as commonly used) is .

The strength of fringing field is closely related to device features such as gate-dielectric thickness, the spacer width, fin width and pitch, as well as the gate height. For undoped fin with underlapping (nonoverlapping source/drain) gate, a thinner spacer with higher kappa value enhances the gate control of short-channel effects (SCEs) and reduces the source-to-drain leakage current. Our results also suggest that reducing the high- gate-dielectric thickness is no longer an effective approach to improve performance in small FinFET devices due to the strong fringing effect. However, the introduction of thin metal gate in a multifin device was found beneficial to device speed without compromising on current drive and SCE.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2008.919308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4494714/04475424.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2008.919308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494714","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the Effects of Fringing Electric Field on FinFET Device Performance and Structural Optimization Using 3-D Simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Effects of Fringing Electric Field on FinFET Device Performance and Structural Optimization Using 3-D Simulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922021","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4475424/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Effects of Fringing Electric Field on FinFET Device Performance and Structural Optimization Using 3-D Simulation","sourcePdf":"55ted05-zhao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078014S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4494714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4494714","articleId":"4475424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4475427,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Simon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/4674374/4475427/4475427-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dan Simon (S'89\u2014M'90\u2014SM'01) received the B.S. degree from Arizona State University, Tempe, the M.S. degree from the University of Washington, Seattle, and the Ph.D. degree from Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, all in electrical engineering.","He worked in industry for 14 years at Boeing, TRW, and several smaller companies.

Mathematical equations that govern the distribution of organisms were first discovered and developed during the 1960s. The mindset of the engineer is that we can learn from nature. This motivates the application of biogeography to optimization problems. Just as the mathematics of biological genetics inspired the development of genetic algorithms (GAs), and the mathematics of biological neurons inspired the development of artificial neural networks, this paper considers the mathematics of biogeography as the basis for the development of a new field: biogeography-based optimization (BBO). We discuss natural biogeography and its mathematics, and then discuss how it can be used to solve optimization problems. We see that BBO has features in common with other biology-based optimization methods, such as GAs and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This makes BBO applicable to many of the same types of problems that GAs and PSO are used for, namely, high-dimension problems with multiple local optima. However, BBO also has some features that are unique among biology-based optimization methods. We demonstrate the performance of BBO on a set of 14 standard benchmarks and compare it with seven other biology-based optimization algorithms. We also demonstrate BBO on a real-world sensor selection problem for aircraft engine health estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475427/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","volume":"12","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10324526","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4475427/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Biogeography-Based Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biogeography-Based Optimization","sourcePdf":"12tevc06-simon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117296S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4674374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"2114","xplore-issue":"4674374","articleId":"4475427","onlineDate":"21 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":4475434,"authors":[{"name":"Chenglong Fu","affiliation":["Department of Precise Instruments and Mechanology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4505400/4475434/4475434-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chenglong Fu was born in Heilongjiang, China, in 1980.

The sensory feedback controller is phase dependent and consists of the torso attitude controller, zero moment point compensator, and impact reducer.

Several components work together in the ZAME tool to make this possible. Efficient matrix ordering algorithms group related elements.

A comparison of measured and simulated waveforms clearly showed that only a small fraction of the perimeter of the emitter-base interface (in the lateral direction) takes part in the switching transient when a capacitor of relatively small value (80 pF) is discharged across the transistor to obtain a current pulse of a few nanoseconds in duration. A good agreement was found between measurements and simulations in the 2-D numerical model when the effective operating perimeter was used as a parameter in the model. The results allowed reliable analyses of the thermal regime to be performed. Possible reasons for the significant current confinement in short-pulsing mode and relatively homogeneous transistor switching with longer current pulses are discussed, and a mechanism of fast lateral turn-on spread is assumed. One conclusion of practical importance is that a short-pulsing relatively high-current mode could not be realized without current confinement in the lateral direction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Current measurement","Switching circuits","Silicon","Optical switches","Voltage measurement","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche breakdown","bipolar transistors","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lateral current confinement","silicon avalanche transistor operation","short-pulsing mode","bipolar junction transistor","high-current short-pulsing","emitter-base interface","transistor switching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Avalanche breakdown","bipolar junction transistor (BJT)","experiment","microwave switches","power semiconductor devices","simulation"]},{"kwd":["Avalanche breakdown","bipolar junction transistor (BJT)","experiment","microwave switches","power semiconductor devices","simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TED.2008.919295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4494714/04475504.pdf","startPage":"1229","endPage":"1236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2008.919295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lateral Current Confinement Determines Silicon Avalanche Transistor Operation in Short-Pulsing Mode","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lateral Current Confinement Determines Silicon Avalanche Transistor Operation in Short-Pulsing Mode","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475504/","volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475504/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9922004","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lateral Current Confinement Determines Silicon Avalanche Transistor Operation in Short-Pulsing Mode","sourcePdf":"55ted05-duan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070299S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4494714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4494714","articleId":"4475504","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4475512,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Chun Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4582432/4475512/4475512-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying-Chun Chuang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1988, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1990, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1997.","Since August 1990, he has been with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

The accurate and independent control of each output requires a sophisticated digital control architecture so as to minimize the cross-regulation problem. The adopted control includes a separate regulation for common-mode and differential-mode output voltages. Due to the differential-mode control loop dependence on the load current, a variable-gain functional block has been investigated; this provision keeps the differential-mode loop gain constant under different load conditions. Moreover, a nonlinear evaluation of the common-mode voltage has been investigated in order to improve the system dynamic response to asymmetrical load changes. Even if aimed at an integrated solution, experimental verifications have been performed using discrete components, implementing the digital control in a field-programmable gate array.

The first solution is based on constrained optimization so that the global problem is split into multiple simple and convex optimizations. Convexity is achieved by setting additional constraints on the mutual interference between the users. The second solution is based on game theory and reaches the Nash equilibrium (i.e., the equilibrium point for non-cooperative games).

As a means to consider the system behavior including the channel code regarding bit or frame error rate (BER, FER) versus normalized average mutual information (NAMI) of an OFDM symbol for several M-QAM alphabets is investigated. To this end an approximation to the mutual information of MIMO systems with M-QAM signal alphabets is derived and compared to channel decomposition approaches to find a complexity/accuracy trade-off. Based on the mutual information results two algorithms using this channel knowledge are introduced. On the one hand, the error rates can be optimized assuming a fixed rate requirement and on the other hand the achieved transmission rate can be optimized under a BER/FER constraint. In both cases a NAMI threshold derived from the simulated system behavior for a specific channel code is used to adapt the allocated modulation alphabets via a greedy algorithm to achieve the target NAMI within an error margin.","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475538","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475538.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual information based rate adaptation for MIMO-OFDM systems with finite signal alphabets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475538/","displayDocTitle":"Mutual information based rate adaptation for MIMO-OFDM systems with finite signal alphabets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903549","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475538/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual information based rate adaptation for MIMO-OFDM systems with finite signal alphabets","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103484S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4475539,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Guthy","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Guthy","id":"37294594500"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"},{"name":"Guido Dietl","affiliation":["DoCoMo Conimunications Laboratories Europe GmbH, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Dietl","id":"37266546100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1756-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1757-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4475539","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","Broadcasting","Channel state information","Transmitters","Quantization","Performance gain","Wireless communication","State feedback","Performance loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quantisation (signal)","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite rate feedback","MIMO","OFDM","broadcast channel","channel state information","transmitter","multiuser wireless communication systems","quantization","receivers"]}],"abstract":"Full channel state information at the transmitter leads to large performance gains in multiuser wireless communication systems.

It is shown that the precoded pilot symbols are sufficient in both uplink and downlink to satisfy the needs of both transmission and reception. The capacity of the system is analyzed in conjunction with linear receivers in a time-varying fading channel. The effect of using transmit and receive CSI estimated from noisy pilot symbols is studied. According to the results the proposed uplink transmission strategy provides capacity gain over non-precoded transmission, without being sensitive to channel time variations and CSI estimation errors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475540.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block diagonalization for multiuser MIMO TDD downlink and uplink in time-varying channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Downlink","Time-varying channels","Radio transmitters","Multiaccess communication","Channel state information","Fading","Matrix decomposition","Receivers","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","fading channels","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block diagonalization","multiuser MIMO","TDD downlink","TDD uplink","time-varying channel","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output communication","channel state information","time division duplex","time-varying fading channel","channel time variations","CSI estimation errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Block diagonalization for multiuser MIMO TDD downlink and uplink in time-varying channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475540/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903551","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block diagonalization for multiuser MIMO TDD downlink and uplink in time-varying channel","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045751S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4475541,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Kuhne","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Laboratory, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Kuhne","id":"37396353500"},{"name":"Anja Klein","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Laboratory, Technische Universitat Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Anja","lastName":"Klein","id":"37288187900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1756-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1757-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4475541","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Diversity reception","Transmitters","Bit error rate","MIMO","Frequency conversion","Block codes","Digital modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel allocation","error statistics","feedback","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive MIMO-OFDM","imperfect CQI feedback","uncoded bit error rate","multiuser multiple input multiple output system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","orthogonal space-time block coding","maximum ratio combining","adaptive transmission mode","adaptive subcarrier allocation","adaptive subcarrier modulation","channel quality information","feedback channel","transmitter","signal-to-noise ratio","multiuser diversity","time delay","feedback errors","nonadaptive transmission mode","frequency diversity","spatial diversity","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, closed form expressions are derived for the average data rate and uncoded bit error rate of a multi-user multiple input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, where two transmission modes are considered, both transmitting the data of the scheduled user using orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) at the transmitter and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver to exploit spatial diversity. Applying the adaptive transmission mode, an adaptive subcarrier allocation and modulation is performed based on channel quality information (CQI) fed back digitised over a feedback channel to the transmitter. As CQI the resulting instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the maximum ratio combiner of the different subcarriers is applied to exploit multi-user diversity. The CQI available at the transmitter side is assumed to be imperfect due to time delay, estimation and feedback errors. Applying the non-adaptive transmission mode, no instantaneous CQI is required. A transmission scheme exploiting frequency diversity in addition to the spatial diversity using OSTBC and MRC is employed. The data rates are compared in order to identify the optimal transmission mode depending on the grade of CQI imperfectness, where a given target bit error rate has to be fullfilled.","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475541","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475541.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MIMO-OFDM using OSTBC with imperfect CQI feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475541/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MIMO-OFDM using OSTBC with imperfect CQI feedback","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903552","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475541/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MIMO-OFDM using OSTBC with imperfect CQI feedback","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057527S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4475542,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiota Lioliou","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Panagiota","lastName":"Lioliou","id":"37394375600"},{"name":"Mats Viberg","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Viberg","id":"37268515700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1756-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1757-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4475542","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":847},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least-Squares based channel estimation for MIMO relays","abstract":"A least-squares based channel estimation algorithm is proposed for relay-assisted wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels.

A number of suboptimal detectors have been proposed to solve that problem, given that maximum likelihood (ML) detection is NP-hard. After reviewing the main concepts of the ML and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) metrics, we introduce an unbiased MMSE metric that can be applied to existing MIMO detectors in order to improve their performance. Applying the biased and unbiased MMSE metrics together with a real-valued representation of the system, the performance and complexity of a number suboptimal MIMO detectors is compared in this paper, showing how the QR decomposition-M (QRD-M) can be used to approximate ML performance with low complexity. In order to further validate those results, the QRD-M algorithm has been implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform, showing an excellent fixed-point performance under real-time conditions. Finally, the resulting real-time detector has been compared to state-of-the-art detectors previously implemented, in terms of complexity, error performance and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475549","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475549.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of MMSE metric based efficient near-ML detection","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903560","htmlLink":"/document/4475549/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of MMSE metric based efficient near-ML detection","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107317S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4475550,"authors":[{"name":"Marko Milojevic","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Milojevic","id":"38229012000"},{"name":"Giovanni Del Galdo","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Del Galdo","id":"37295435200"},{"name":"Martin Haardt","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Haardt","id":"37285060400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1756-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1757-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4475550","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Nonlinear filters","Tensile stress","Adaptive filters","Prediction methods","OFDM","Predictive models","Frequency estimation","Singular value decomposition","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","singular value decomposition","telecommunication channels","tensors","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tensor-based framework","frequency-selective MIMO channels","time-variant MIMO channels","multiple-input multiple-output channels","noisy channel estimates","higher order singular value decomposition","transformed tensor elements","inverse transformation","signal subspace","normalized mean square error","prediction method","Wiener filter","channel coefficients"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution we propose a tensor-based framework for the prediction of time-variant frequency-selective multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels from noisy channel estimates. This method performs the prediction in a transformed domain obtained via the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD), namely on the transformed tensor elements. This is followed by the inverse transformation of the predicted transformed tensor elements onto a basis corresponding to the signal subspace. To verify our strategy, we compare the results in terms of the normalized mean square error using a known prediction method, e.g., a Wiener filter, applied to the transformed tensor elements with the identical method applied directly to the channel coefficients. The results of our investigation show that the tensor-based prediction method outperforms the direct prediction method.

If the optimum rate vector lies in a time-sharing region, it is necessary to identify a set of corner points of the time-sharing region such that the optimum rate vector is a convex combination of these corner points. In a if user MIMO BC, the maximum number of corner points is K!, thus enumerating all corner points is only feasible for small K. In this work, an efficient algorithm for identifying a subset of relevant corner points is proposed.

The advantage of using XPD cross-polarised antennas in cellular MIMO-OFDM systems is that XPD antennas save costs and space achieved by a more compact antenna design. The throughput performance is generally considered to be similar to co-polarised antennas with pre-coding. In this paper we show the achievable gains of using cross-polarised antennas as compared to co-polarised antennas at the base station. These cross-polarised antennas are used for adaptive MIMO transmission for typical outdoor scenarios. Our results are based on real-time multiuser (MU) multi-antenna capacity measurements taken with a MIMO-OFDMA system with parameters close to the current 3G-Long-Term-Evolution (LTE) standard. Downlink transmission is considered in a single-cell outdoor scenario. We demonstrate the significant effect of polarisation on the overall system performance, especially on user sum rates when fairness scheduling in OFDMA is applied.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarisation dependent MIMO gains on multiuser downlink OFDMA with a 3GPP LTE air interface in typical urban outdoor scenarios","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475552","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475552.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Polarisation dependent MIMO gains on multiuser downlink OFDMA with a 3GPP LTE air interface in typical urban outdoor scenarios","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475552/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903563","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarisation dependent MIMO gains on multiuser downlink OFDMA with a 3GPP LTE air interface in typical urban outdoor scenarios","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076645S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4475553,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Wolfgang","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Wolfgang","id":"37266496300"},{"name":"Nima Seifi","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Seifi","id":"37705124100"},{"name":"Tony Ottosson","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"Ottosson","id":"37275235100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1756-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1757-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4475553","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"abstract":"In this paper we investigate the use of infrastructure half-duplex amplify-and-forward (AF) relays in the downlink of a multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which uses linear precoding based on block-diagonalization.

During the first time-slot the relay nodes are treated as an additional mobile station (MS), while during the second time-slot the base-station (BS) and the relays form a distributed, virtual antenna array. In contrast to many relay applications, the purpose of the proposed scheme is not to increase diversity, but rather to increase the system throughput at the borders of a communication cell or in areas with a high user density.

For the time-varying interference scenario, the initial estimate of channel coefficient and the noise PSD are obtained from pilots and further estimations are refined using turbo decoder soft outputs. In contrast, pilot symbols are eliminated for the single-user iterative receiver with initial estimation performed from the received code symbols, followed by the iterative updates using the feedback from the turbo decoder as before.

The concept has the potential for the application in a low cost automotive radar sensor that is expected to fulfill high DOA estimation requirements.","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475557","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475557.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475557","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","startPage":"184","endPage":"189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dielectric lens antenna for digital beamforming and superresolution DOA estimation in 77 GHz automotive radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A dielectric lens antenna for digital beamforming and superresolution DOA estimation in 77 GHz automotive radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475557/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475557/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903568","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dielectric lens antenna for digital beamforming and superresolution DOA estimation in 77 GHz automotive radar","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061706S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4475558,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Communications Research Group Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279769000"},{"name":"Stephan Weiss","affiliation":["Institute of Comms & Signal Processing Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, UK"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37276935000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1756-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1757-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4475558","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475558","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadband antennas","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["off-broadside main beam design","frequency invariant beamformers","steering delay filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["frequency invariant beamforming","broadband arrays","off-broadside main beam"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475558","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475558.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Off-broadside main beam design for frequency invariant beamformers","abstract":"In a previously proposed design method for frequency invariant beamforming, the design for the case of an off-broadside main beam is not satisfactory.

We focus on a scenario with per-antenna power constraint, which is of importance for a realistic implementation. Two design criteria are considered: (1) maximizing the weighted sum rate subject to per-antenna power constraints; (2) maximizing the minimum user rate subject to per-antenna power constraints. Non-convexity and the complicated mathematical structure of the problems make it difficult to derive efficient, globally optimal algorithms. Even the power allocation problem for sum-rate optimization leads to a problem formulation involving ratios of posynomials, which is generally an intrinsically intractable NP hard problem. The problems studied here are even more complicated, since we consider a joint optimization over powers, transmit filters and receive filters. For these problems, we derive iterative algorithms and prove the monotonic convergence of the algorithms. Additionally, we show that the results can be extended to other variations of the problems and the problems with other kinds of power constraints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Per-antenna power constrained rate optimization for multiuser MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475569","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475569.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Per-antenna power constrained rate optimization for multiuser MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475569/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903580","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Per-antenna power constrained rate optimization for multiuser MIMO systems","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079663S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4475570,"authors":[{"name":"Amine Mezghani","affiliation":["Institute for Circuit Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Amine","lastName":"Mezghani","id":"37294420600"},{"name":"Mohamed-Seifeddine Khoufi","affiliation":["Institute for Circuit Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Seifeddine","lastName":"Khoufi","id":"38096609000"},{"name":"Josef A.

In this case, the precoders designed for those streams based on covariance channel state information (CSI) will be identical, therefore, they can not separate the user successfully. To overcome this, we modify the covariance matrices by keeping the eigenvectors unchanged and choosing one eigenvalue per stream if the number of streams equals to the rank of the covariance matrix. Otherwise, the eigenvalues will be divided into different groups with the rule making the sums of each group as similar as possible. Then, the precoders are designed based on the modified covariance matrices with the constraint of total transmit power.

Although MIMO-OFDM systems provide both spatial and frequency diversities that can be exploited by the transmitter, e. g. through spreading, they often suffer from the presence of antenna correlations which can degrade the system performance. Full channel knowledge is usually assumed at the receiver and none at the transmitter. In this paper, partial channel knowledge (transmit correlations) is assumed to be available at the transmitter and is exploited by the precoder. Spreading is also applied at the transmitter to extract the MIMO-OFDM diversity either fully or partially. In addition, coded transmission using convolutional codes is assumed. At the receiver, iterative equalization and decoding is employed assuming full channel knowledge. Two sub-optimum equalizers, soft Cholesky equalizer (SCE) and recurrent neural network equalizer (RNN), are used for equalization. Through the used of EXIT-charts, the performance of the MIMO-OFDM system with both precoding and spreading is analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475573","startPage":"296","endPage":"303","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475573.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding and spreading for coded MIMO-OFDM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Precoding and spreading for coded MIMO-OFDM","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475573/","accessionNumber":"9903584","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475573/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding and spreading for coded MIMO-OFDM","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042722S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4475574,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Klenner","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Klenner","id":"37294637000"},{"name":"Karl-Dirk Kammeyer","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl-Dirk","lastName":"Kammeyer","id":"37270666500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1756-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1757-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4475574","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Space time codes","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Maximum likelihood detection","OFDM modulation","Fluctuations","Interference","Counting circuits","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing","frequency selective surfaces","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time-coded OFDM","sectorized antenna reception","frequency selective channels","omnidirectional antenna"]}],"abstract":"Diversity is a well-known means to counter the detrimental effect of fading. Against this background, space-time codes have been designed to facilitate transmit diversity with a suitable receiver. Furthermore, space-time codes combined with OFDM allow for the utilization of frequency selective channels. However, a general assumption underlying the design of space-time codes is the time-invariance of the channel, which is violated in a high mobility environment. Large Doppler spread causing rapidly time-varying channels can be compensated at the receiver by sectorized antennas, which restrict the angle of incidence of imping waves to a finite range. Compared to an omnidirectional antenna, the resulting Doppler spread of a sector antenna and the channels time-variance are reduced. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of Doppler compensating sectorized antennas for space-time coded OFDM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of space-time-coded OFDM with sectorized antenna reception","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475574","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475574.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance of space-time-coded OFDM with sectorized antenna reception","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475574/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903585","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of space-time-coded OFDM with sectorized antenna reception","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095285S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4475575,"authors":[{"name":"V.V.

This issue becomes even more serious in a multi-antenna transmitter. To increase power efficiency, a PAR reduction scheme must be applied at the transmitter. Recently, generalizations of two popular PAR reduction techniques, partial transmit sequences (PTS) and selected mapping (SLM), to multi-antenna systems have been proposed. In this paper, a comparison of these two schemes is accomplished. For that purpose, a point-to-point and a broadcast scenario is assessed. It is shown that under the condition of (almost) same computational complexity, PTS offers significant gains compared to SLM.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475577.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of partial transmit sequences and selected mapping for peak-to-average power ratio reduction in MIMO OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial transmit sequences","Peak to average power ratio","MIMO","OFDM","Broadcasting","Transmitters","Signal generators","Power system modeling","Power measurement","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio links","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO OFDM","partial transmit sequences","selected mapping","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","multicarrier systems","multiantenna transmitter","point-to-point communication","broadcast scenario","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of partial transmit sequences and selected mapping for peak-to-average power ratio reduction in MIMO OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475577/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903588","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of partial transmit sequences and selected mapping for peak-to-average power ratio reduction in MIMO OFDM","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050733S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4475579,"authors":[{"name":"Dagmar Bosanska","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Dagmar","lastName":"Bosanska","id":"37939090200"},{"name":"Christian Mehlfuhrer","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Mehlfuhrer","id":"37296855600"},{"name":"Markus Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Rupp","id":"37276736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1756-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1757-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4475579","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475579","abstract":"In this paper we compare interference cancelation to MMSE equalization in the context of D-TxAA (dual stream transmit antenna array) HSDPA. The interference cancelation is carried out in three steps. After canceling the deterministic channels (pilot and synchronization channel), one user data stream is reconstructed by an MMSE equalizer. This data stream is transmitted over a replicated \"virtual\" channel and its output subtracted from the received signal. From the remaining received signal we reconstruct the second data stream by a second equalizer. Our performance evaluation is based on the physical layer coded data throughput. The interference cancelation receiver shows large performance gain (approx. 2.0 dB) over the state-of-the-art MMSE equalizer while the complexity is only increased slightly.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Transmitting antennas","Equalizers","Antenna arrays","Frequency synchronization","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Radiofrequency interference","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna arrays","code division multiple access","equalisers","interference suppression","packet radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intracell interference cancelation","D-TxAA HSDPA","MMSE equalization","dual stream transmit antenna array","pilot and synchronization channel","high speed downlink packet access"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475579","startPage":"338","endPage":"342","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475579.pdf","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of intra-cell interference cancelation in D-TxAA HSDPA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of intra-cell interference cancelation in D-TxAA HSDPA","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9903590","publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4475579/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of intra-cell interference cancelation in D-TxAA HSDPA","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070499S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4475580,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The installation of such systems on board of aircraft requires the development of a very low-profile aircraft antenna, which can point to satellites anywhere in the upper hemisphere. To this end, phased array antennas which are conformal to the aircraft fuselage are attractive. In this paper two key aspects of conformal phased array antenna arrays are addressed: the development of a broadband Ku-band antenna and the beam synthesis for conformal array antennas. The antenna elements of the conformal array are stacked patch antennas with dual linear polarization which have sufficient bandwidth. For beam forming synthesis a method based on a truncated singular value decomposition is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475580","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475580.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","startPage":"343","endPage":"350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conformal phased array with beam forming for airborne satellite communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Conformal phased array with beam forming for airborne satellite communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475580/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903591","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4475580/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conformal phased array with beam forming for airborne satellite communication","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07276S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4475581,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, this is not true in most practical situations and, in order to avoid the serious performance degradation that occurs when the CIR length is underestimated, a channel with \"more than enough\" taps is usually considered. This possibly means overestimating the channel order, and is not desirable since the computational complexity of maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) in frequency-selective channels grows exponentially with the channel order. In addition to that, the higher the channel order considered, the more the number of channel coefficients that need to be estimated from the same set of observations. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for MLSD that incorporates the full estimation of the MIMO CIR parameters, including its order. The proposed technique is based on the per survivor processing (PSP) methodology, it admits both blind and semiblind implementations, depending on the availability of pilot data, and is designed to work with time-selective channels. Besides the analytical derivation of the algorithm, we provide computer simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the resulting receiver.","doi":"10.1109/WSA.2008.4475587","publicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel5/4470160/4475528/04475587.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSA.2008.4475587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A per-survivor processing algorithm for maximum likelihood equalization of MIMO channels with unknown order","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475587/","displayDocTitle":"A per-survivor processing algorithm for maximum likelihood equalization of MIMO channels with unknown order","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2008","accessionNumber":"9903598","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475587/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A per-survivor processing algorithm for maximum likelihood equalization of MIMO channels with unknown order","confLoc":"Darmstadt, Germany","sourcePdf":"SPI-03172008-00059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053224S","chronDate":"26-27 Feb. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4470160","isNumber":"4475528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4470160","xplore-issue":"4475528","articleId":"4475587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4475612,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Zhang","affiliation":["Guizhou University, China"],"lastName":"Zhenyu Zhang","id":"37985103700"},{"name":"Xiaoyao Xie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information,Computing Science of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Normal University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoyao Xie","id":"37400127100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1430-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-6364"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-6372"}],"articleNumber":"4475612","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":995},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475612","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Neural networks","Engines","Artificial intelligence","Artificial neural networks","Learning","Costs","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","genetic algorithms","knowledge based systems","neural nets","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent cognitive radio","neural network","artificial intelligence techniques","GA","learning best decision","knowledge base information model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Artificial Intelligence","Neural Network","Cognitive Radio Engine","Genetic Algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITICT.2007.4475612","publicationTitle":"2007 ITI 5th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 ITI 5th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459487/4475588/04475612.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITICT.2007.4475612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent cognitive radio: Research on learning and evaluation of CR based on Neural Network","abstract":"This paper introduces the research of cognitive engine and application of artificial intelligence techniques in cognitive radio.

The main idea behind this scheme is that the output of the 3D-SPIHT video coding will be send related to its significant information. The modified 3D-SPIHT coder will generate three groups of bitstream. The significant bits, the sign bits, and the refinement bits are transmitted in three different groups. The optimal Unequal Error Protection (UEP) of these groups is proposed. The RS code is used to test the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. In addition to UEP, the power optimization over the Code-Division Multiple Access channels (CDMA) is done which increases the performance of our system. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme provides significantly better PSNR performance in comparison with the well-known robust coding schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ITICT.2007.4475615","publicationTitle":"2007 ITI 5th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 ITI 5th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459487/4475588/04475615.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITICT.2007.4475615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video transmission over CDMA channels with bit-rate allocation and power optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475615/","displayDocTitle":"Video transmission over CDMA channels with bit-rate allocation and power optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9874434","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475615/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video transmission over CDMA channels with bit-rate allocation and power optimization","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"SPI-03152008-00027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054269S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4459487","isNumber":"4475588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459487","xplore-issue":"4475588","articleId":"4475615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4475628,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan M.

Early orbit mode data from the SSMIS are used to create radiometric images of the warm calibration load that evolve over an entire orbit to elucidate the effects of direct and reflected solar illumination of the warm-load (WL) emissive surface. Analysis of the radiometric gain and apparent WL radiometric brightness temperature observed during the solar intrusion events show the impact of these events on the SSMIS calibration. A graphical simulation of the SSMIS and DMSP spacecraft is used to define the regions where solar intrusion occurs and to characterize the WL anomalous regions for the specific DMSP F-16 orbit. The graphical simulation is also used to determine the cause of additional calibration errors that were identified by using comparisons to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, as emission from the SSMIS reflector antenna. Mitigation of these calibration anomalies is critical if the operational SSMIS radiometers achieve their full utility in NWP, climate monitoring, forecasting, and other emerging applications. A detailed characterization of the SSMIS calibration provides a basis for this process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) Radiometric Calibration Anomalies\u2014Part I: Identification and Characterization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.917213","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4475697/04475707.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.917213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475697","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) Radiometric Calibration Anomalies\u2014Part I: Identification and Characterization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4475707/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9943659","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) Radiometric Calibration Anomalies\u2014Part I: Identification and Characterization","sourcePdf":"46tgrs04-kunkee3-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066264S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4475697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4475697","articleId":"4475707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4475735,"authors":[{"name":"N.P.

Near-far problem is critical and needs to be mitigated at any cost. The basic idea behind the power control is to adjust the transmission powers in such a way that interference power from each transmitter to other users is minimized while preserving the sufficient quality of service QoS. Co-channel interference management is critical for CDMA based communication systems because of unity frequency reuse factor. In CDMA cellular systems interference occurs both within the cell and from outside the cell, hence CDMA systems are interference limited. In this paper we discuss the channel prediction using the weighted least square error WLSE algorithm for DS-CDMA channel described by Rayleigh fading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WLS Channel Prediction for Power Control in DS-CDMA Cellular Communication Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 Third International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/WCSN.2007.4475755","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Third International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472732/4475726/04475755.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSN.2007.4475755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"WLS Channel Prediction for Power Control in DS-CDMA Cellular Communication Systems","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475755/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9882773","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WLS Channel Prediction for Power Control in DS-CDMA Cellular Communication Systems","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"WCSN-00-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08168S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4472732","isNumber":"4475726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472732","xplore-issue":"4475726","articleId":"4475755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4475767,"authors":[{"name":"U.D.

OFDM is a wideband multicarrier digital modulation scheme, very much suitable for applications like WiMax because of its features such as ISI elimination and high speed support due to parallel transmissions. Now, complexity in the WiMax system is because of fast varying channel due to vehicular mobility and frequency selective channel due to wideband transmission. At the same time for the portable battery operated device, power consumption should be less i.e signal processing must be minimum and fast and it should support higher bit rate. Always the tradeoff exists in any of the selection. In addition to this, while using modulation mapping schemes like QAM, channel effects are more critical and estimation at the receiver becomes compulsory. Channel estimation related issues become very important in this scenario, because FFT and Adaptive channel estimation stages mostly consumes the power due to heavy processing burden. Different issues related to channel estimation methods are studied in this paper and efforts are made to find out the optimum solutions for best BER performance. Few innovative ideas are also suggested.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Third International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4472732/4475726/04475767.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"154","publicationTitle":"2007 Third International Conference on Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/WCSN.2007.4475767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSN.2007.4475767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4475767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Issues Related to Adaptive Channel Estimation in OFDM System-MWBA Aspects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","WiMAX","Wideband","Digital modulation","Intersymbol interference","Batteries","Energy consumption","Signal processing","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","channel estimation","error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","IEEE standards","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","WiMax","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive channel estimation","OFDM system","MWBA aspects","mobile wireless broadband access","WiMax versions","IEEE 802.16e","ISI elimination","vehicular mobility","frequency selective channel","QAM","FFT","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Pilots","Fading","adaptive filter","channel estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Study of Issues Related to Adaptive Channel Estimation in OFDM System-MWBA Aspects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475767/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"9882759","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Issues Related to Adaptive Channel Estimation in OFDM System-MWBA Aspects","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"WCSN-00-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076861S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4472732","isNumber":"4475726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4472732","xplore-issue":"4475726","articleId":"4475767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4475813,"authors":[{"name":"Rod Blaine Foist","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Rod Blaine Foist (S'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1982 and 1989, respectively.

First, a 3D wavelet transform is performed on each selected video shot, then the watermark is embedded in the LL subband wavelet coefficients of the low-pass frames, therefore the scheme has strong robustness against common video processing attacks. At the same time, in order to guarantee the perceptual invisibility, the coefficient is selected adaptively to embed the watermark and the embedding intensity is adaptively controlled using the statistical characteristics (mean and standard deviation). In addition, embedding and extraction of the watermark are based on the relationship between a wavelet coefficient and its neighbor's. A neural network is given to memorize the relationships among the coefficients in a 3\u00d73 block. The watermark extraction process does not require the original video. Experimental results show that the embedded watermark is robust and invisible.","doi":"10.1109/ISM.Workshops.2007.29","startPage":"110","endPage":"115","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia Workshops (ISMW 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4475928/4475929/04475958.pdf","publicationTitle":"Ninth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia Workshops (ISMW 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.Workshops.2007.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Video Watermarking Scheme Based on 3D-DWT and Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Neural networks","Robustness","Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet domain","Artificial neural networks","Wavelet coefficients","Protection","Discrete transforms","Digital images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Video Watermarking Scheme Based on 3D-DWT and Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4475958/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Video Watermarking Scheme Based on 3D-DWT and Neural Network","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"30840110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03716S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4475928","isNumber":"4475929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4475928","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4475929","articleId":"4475958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4475964,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Han Tsai","affiliation":["Department of electrical Engineering, National central university, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Han","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37271381400"},{"name":"Wen-Tsai Sheu","affiliation":["Department of electrical Engineering, National central university, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Tsai","lastName":"Sheu","id":"37407803900"},{"name":"Chung-Yuan Lin","affiliation":["Department of electrical Engineering, National central university, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Yuan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404177800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-3084-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4475964","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Layout","Pixel","Application software","Gaussian distribution","Statistics","Cameras","Legged locomotion","Conferences","Image sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","image sequences","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["foreground object detection","multimodel background maintenance","time-varying background image","statistical information","multimodel Gaussian distribution","image sequences"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of background maintenance for foreground object detection.

In this paper, a fast and low complexity transformation from the original feature space into k-dimensional vector space and clustering are proposed to alleviate the problem. First k key- samples are chosen randomly from the database. These sam- ples and a distance function specify the transformation from the series of feature vectors into k-dimensional vector space where database (re)clustering can be done fast with plural- ity of traditional clustering technique whenever required. In the experiments, similarity between the samples was calcu- lated by using the Euclidean distance between their associated feature vector probability density functions. The k-means al- gorithm was used to cluster the transformed samples in the vector space. The experiments show that considerable time and computational savings are achieved while there is only a marginal drop in performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4475987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4475987/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Query by Example in Large Databases Using Key-Sample Distance Transformation and Clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Query by Example in Large Databases Using Key-Sample Distance Transformation and Clustering","confLoc":"Taichung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"30840303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05074S","chronDate":"10-12 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4475928","isNumber":"4475929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4475928","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4475929","articleId":"4475987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4476028,"authors":[{"name":"Amirhossein Alimohammad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4490005/4476028/4476028-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amirhossein Alimohammad (S'01\u2013M'07) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, the M.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, and the B.Sc. degree from the University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.","He is a Postdoctoral Fellow with the University of Alberta.

The proposed GVG has a faster Gaussian sample generation rate and higher tail accuracy with a lower hardware cost than published designs. The GVG design can be readily configured to achieve arbitrary tail accuracy (i.e., with a proposed 16-bit datapath up to plusmn15 times the standard deviation sigma) with only small variations in hardware utilization, and without degrading the output sample rate. Polynomial curve fitting is utilized along with a hybrid (i.e., combination of logarithmic and uniform) segmentation and a scaling scheme to maintain accuracy. A typical instantiation of the proposed GVG occupies only 534 configurable slices, two on-chip block memories, and three dedicated multipliers of the Xilinx Virtex-II XC2V4000-6 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and operates at 248 MHz, generating 496 million Gaussian variates (GVs) per second within a range of plusmn6.66sigma. To accurately achieve a range of plusmn9.4sigma, the GVG uses 852 configurable slices, three block memories, and three on-chip dedicated multipliers of the same FPGA while still operating at 248 MHz, generating 496 million GVs per second. The core area and performance of a GVG implemented in a 90-nm CMOS technology are also given.

The interior layer problem, consisting of vias between two reference planes, is solved using the Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations. The exterior layer problem is solved using the method of moments (MoM) with the layered media Green's functions. The exterior layer and interior layer problems are combined to obtain the S-parameters of the trace and through-hole via. A fast approach for calculating the layered-medium Green's functions using the numerical modified steepest descent path method is utilized. The Green's functions require milliseconds to compute per point.

The purpose of the combination is to obtain an LMS adaptive filter with fast convergence and small steady-state mean-square deviation (MSD). The linear combination studied is a generalization of the convex combination, in which the combination factor lambda(n) is restricted to the interval (0,1). The viewpoint is taken that each of the two filters produces dependent estimates of the unknown channel. Thus, there exists a sequence of optimal affine combining coefficients which minimizes the mean-square error (MSE). First, the optimal unrealizable affine combiner is studied and provides the best possible performance for this class. Then two new schemes are proposed for practical applications. The mean-square performances are analyzed and validated by Monte Carlo simulations. With proper design, the two practical schemes yield an overall MSD that is usually less than the MSDs of either filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921319","htmlLink":"/document/4476036/","displayDocTitle":"An Affine Combination of Two LMS Adaptive Filters\u2014Transient Mean-Square Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Affine Combination of Two LMS Adaptive Filters\u2014Transient Mean-Square Analysis","sourcePdf":"56tsp05-bershad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09843S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4490093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"4490093","articleId":"4476036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4476040,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrez Souden","affiliation":["INRS-\u00c9MT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4490093/4476040/4476040-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehrez Souden (S'06) was born in 1980.

In contrast to earlier works, we consider both long- and short-term channel variations, typically encountered in wireless links. In the first stage, we exploit sources independence to blindly estimate the channel over several data blocks regularly spaced by intervals larger than the coherence time but each, short enough in length, to make time variations negligible within the block duration. We, thereby, decouple the multisource channel parameters estimation problem in hand into parallel and independent single-source channel parameters estimation subproblems. In the second stage, for each spatially scattered source, we process the corresponding sequence of quasi-independent channel realization estimates as a new single-scattered-source observation over which we apply Taylor series expansions to transform the estimation of the nominal AoA and the AS of the corresponding scattered source into a simple localization of two closely spaced, equi-powered, and uncorrelated rays (i.e., point sources). To localize both rays, we propose new accurate and computationally simple closed-form expressions for the mean value of the spatial harmonics and their separation by means of covariance fitting. An asymptotic performance analysis is also provided to prove the efficiency of the proposed estimators. Then, the AS and the nominal AoA of every source are directly deduced. The whole proposed framework takes advantage of the capabilities of the preprocessing channel identification step (to reduce the noise effect and decouple the estimation of the channel parameters of every source from the others) and the new simple and accurate closed-form estimators to accurately retrieve the channel parameters even in the most adverse conditions, mainly low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), few sensors, no prior knowledge of the angular distribution, and closely spaced sources, as supported by simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921348","htmlLink":"/document/4476040/","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Stage Approach to Estimate the Angles of Arrival and the Angular Spreads of Locally Scattered Sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Stage Approach to Estimate the Angles of Arrival and the Angular Spreads of Locally Scattered Sources","sourcePdf":"56tsp05-souden.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.219052S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4490093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"4490093","articleId":"4476040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4476049,"authors":[{"name":"Saswati Ghosh","affiliation":["Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Saswati","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37288557000"},{"name":"Ajay Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37298736500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4476049","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2319},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband technology","Receiving antennas","Electromagnetic interference","Dielectric resonator antennas","Ultra wideband antennas","Loaded antennas","Transmitting antennas","Bandwidth","Antenna accessories","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","dielectric resonator antennas","electromagnetic interference","monopole antennas","sensors","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrawideband antenna","dielectric loaded T-shaped antenna","monopole transmit antenna","monopole receive antenna","electromagnetic interference sensor","annular dielectric resonator","monopole-like radiation pattern","incident electric field","cross-polarized component","cross-polarization isolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna factor","dielectric resonator antenna (DRA)","T-shaped monopole","ultrawideband"]},{"kwd":["Antenna factor","Dielectric resonator antenna","T-shaped monopole","Ultra wideband"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrawideband Performance of Dielectric Loaded T-Shaped Monopole Transmit and Receive Antenna/EMI Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476049","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2008.921335","startPage":"358","endPage":"361","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4446029/04476049.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2008.921335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4446029","abstract":"This letter presents the performance of a T-shaped monopole antenna loaded with an annular dielectric resonator as an ultrawideband transmitting/receiving antenna.

of imbalanced insertion loss of phase-shifters, satisfying phase conjugate condition does not necessarily lead to the maximum phased array gain. This paper introduces noncoherent beamforming and uses lab-measured characteristics of varactor-based phase shifters to prove that by perturbing coherency partially, the array gain can increase significantly, e.g., 1.6 dB for a 12 element array. Moreover, it is shown that reduction in the average insertion loss increases the array efficiency by almost the same amount. These results are extendible to the optical beamforming networks where different lengths of fiber are used to make true time delay lines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2008","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10138412","htmlLink":"/document/4476094/","displayDocTitle":"The Effects of Imbalanced Phase Shifters Loss on Phased Array Gain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effects of Imbalanced Phase Shifters Loss on Phased Array Gain","sourcePdf":"07lawp01-fakharzadeh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044233S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4446029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4446029","articleId":"4476094","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4476144,"authors":[{"name":"Ngai M.

In particular, the mean image intensity is preserved while the contrast is enhanced. This provides better viewing consistence and effectiveness. The contrast enhancement is achieved by maximizing the information content carried in the image via a continuous intensity transform function. The preservation of image intensity is obtained by applying gamma-correction on the images. Since there is always a trade-off between the requirements for the enhancement of contrast and preservation of intensity, an improved multiobjective particle swarm optimization procedure is proposed to resolve this contradiction, making use of its flexible algorithmic structure. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by a number of images including the benchmarks and an image sequence captured from a mobile robot in an indoor environment.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2008.917053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/4740132/04476144.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2008.917053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740132","startPage":"145","endPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contrast Enhancement and Intensity Preservation for Gray-Level Images Using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Contrast Enhancement and Intensity Preservation for Gray-Level Images Using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476144/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370220","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4476144/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contrast Enhancement and Intensity Preservation for Gray-Level Images Using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tase-kwok-917053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081927S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"4740132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4740132","articleId":"4476144","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4476150,"authors":[{"name":"Derek A.

The question of whether or how much pumped storage to include is addressed by formulating a linear programming optimization problem. The stochastic nature of load and renewable production is addressed using scenarios developed through fuzzy clustering. Both the unit capacity in MW and the reservoir storage capacity in MWh are optimized, and optimal operating strategies for the scenarios are produced. Results showed that including pumped storage can be an effective means of allowing larger penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, improving both the dynamic security and the economic operation of a test system. Including the dynamic security criteria in the economic question of dimensioning the pumped storage unit proved to make a significant difference in the optimal pumped storage capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/4494587/04476156.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2008.919419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Pumped Storage Capacity in an Isolated Power System With Large Renewable Penetration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Secure storage","Power generation economics","Power system security","Energy storage","Renewable energy resources","Power system analysis computing","Power system economics","Linear programming","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy systems","linear programming","power system economics","pumped-storage power stations","renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isolated power system","economic analysis","small island system","linear programming optimization problem","load production","renewable production","fuzzy clustering","reservoir storage capacity","renewable energy sources","dynamic security","economic operation","optimal pumped storage capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy storage","optimization","power systems economics","stochastic processes","wind energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Pumped Storage Capacity in an Isolated Power System With Large Renewable Penetration","volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4476156/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9922134","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Pumped Storage Capacity in an Isolated Power System With Large Renewable Penetration","sourcePdf":"23tpwrs02-brown.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060148S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"4494587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"4494587","articleId":"4476156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4476159,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

This is possible because network coding and MIMO solve similar problems, namely to decode a vector of transmitted symbols given a vector of received samples. This observation leads to a new approach for NC coding/decoding. Our basic idea is to move network coding functionalities towards the physical layer in order to jointly perform NC decoding and MIMO detection and gain the advantages of the two approaches. We refer to this new strategy as MIMO_NC. Theoretical analysis and simulations prove that our system is more robust than traditional network coding to fading and packet losses.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Coding meets MIMO","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth Workshop on Network Coding, Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/NETCOD.2008.4476169","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth Workshop on Network Coding, Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459055/4476167/04476169.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETCOD.2008.4476169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Network Coding meets MIMO","conferenceDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4476169/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9873255","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Coding meets MIMO","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"NETCOD-00-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112234S","chronDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4459055","isNumber":"4476167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459055","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4476167","articleId":"4476169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4476175,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan Tran","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Tuan","lastName":"Tran","id":"38524530800"},{"name":"Thinh Nguyen","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Thinh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37293066800"},{"name":"Bella Bose","affiliation":["School of EECS, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Bella","lastName":"Bose","id":"37272761000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1689-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-9660"}],"articleNumber":"4476175","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Bandwidth","Forward error correction","Channel coding","Network coding","Automatic repeat request","Wireless LAN","WiMAX","Broadcasting","Unicast"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error correction","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint network-channel coding technique","single-hop wireless networks","error-prone channel","forward error correction","automatic repeat request technique"]}],"abstract":"Reliable transmission over an error-prone channel is typically accomplished via channel coding or retransmission of the lost information. In this paper, we investigate a joint network-channel coding technique to increase the bandwidth efficiency of wireless networks. In particular, we show that the proposed joint network-channel coding approach which combines the recent network coding (NC) concept with the traditional forward error correction (FEC) technique, can increase the bandwidth efficiency in single-hop wireless networks such as WLAN or WiMAX networks. We present some analytical results on the bandwidth efficiency for both broadcast and unicast scenarios. Based on these theoretical results, we provide a heuristic algorithm that dynamically selects the optimal level of FEC to be used with network coding technique for given channel conditions. For typical channel characteristics, both simulations and theoretical results confirm that the proposed joint network channel coding approach can reduce the bandwidth usage up to five times over the automatic repeat request (ARQ) technique and up to two times over the HARQ technique.","doi":"10.1109/NETCOD.2008.4476175","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth Workshop on Network Coding, Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth Workshop on Network Coding, Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459055/4476167/04476175.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETCOD.2008.4476175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476167","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Network-Channel Coding Technique for Single-Hop Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Network-Channel Coding Technique for Single-Hop Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476175/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9873261","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4476175/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Network-Channel Coding Technique for Single-Hop Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"NETCOD-00-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051877S","chronDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4459055","isNumber":"4476167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459055","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4476167","articleId":"4476175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-11"},{"_id":4476179,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo-Yen Robert Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shuo-Yen Robert","lastName":"Li","id":"37350874000"},{"name":"Siu Ting Ho","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Siu Ting","lastName":"Ho","id":"37309451100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1689-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-9660"}],"articleNumber":"4476179","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476179","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Network coding","Peer to peer computing","Kernel","Decoding","Polynomials","Broadcasting","Power engineering and energy","Cost accounting","Boundary conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","decoding","linear codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional network coding","symbol stream propagation","linear time-invariant encoder","coding/decoding kernels","rational power series","discrete valuation ring"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NETCOD.2008.4476179","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459055/4476167/04476179.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth Workshop on Network Coding, Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth Workshop on Network Coding, Theory and Applications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETCOD.2008.4476179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ring-theoretic foundation of convolutional network coding","abstract":"Convolutional network coding deals with the propagation of symbol streams through a network with a linear time-invariant encoder at every node. When the symbol alphabet is a field F, a symbol stream becomes a power series over F. Physical implementation requires the coding/decoding kernels be restricted to finite objects. A proper domain for convolutional network coding consists of rational power series rather than polynomials, because polynomial coding kernels do not necessarily correspond to polynomial decoding kernels when the network includes a cycle. One naturally wonders what algebraic structure makes rational power series a suitable domain for coding/decoding kernels. The proposed answer by this paper is discrete valuation ring (DVR). A general abstract theory of convolutional network coding is formulated over a generic DVR and does not confine convolutional network coding to the combined space-time domain. Abstract generality enhances mathematical elegance, depth of understanding, and adaptability to practical applications. Optimal convolutional network codes at various levels of strength are introduced and constructed for delivering highest possible data rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476179/","accessionNumber":"9873265","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","conferenceDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ring-theoretic foundation of convolutional network coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ring-theoretic foundation of convolutional network coding","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"NETCOD-00-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050987S","chronDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","isNumber":"4476167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459055","citationCount":"14","articleId":"4476179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4476183,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Keller","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Keller","id":"37311912600"},{"name":"Eleni Drinea","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Eleni","lastName":"Drinea","id":"37283016200"},{"name":"Christina Fragouli","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Fragouli","id":"37269587400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1689-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-9660"}],"articleNumber":"4476183","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":388},"abstract":"Consider a source broadcasting \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n packets to \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n receivers over independent erasure channels, where perfect feedback is available from the receivers to the source, and the source is allowed to use coding.

We suggest two applications where using such codes can be advantageous. First, we demonstrate that the multi-resolution behaviour of ANCs potentially outperforms that of algebraic network codes. Second, the interfering and fading nature of wireless channels naturally results in complex linear combinations of transmissions, analogous to ANCs. We then characterize the multicast rates achievable by ANCs, and demonstrate that for high precision arithmetic these are equivalent to those obtained by algebraic network codes. We show the connection between the performance of ANCs and the numerical conditioning of network transform matrices. Using this, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of significant bits required to perform the finite precision arithmetic in terms of the network parameters.

Due to the diversity of channel gains among the downlink subscribers, it is known that dynamic allocation of subcarriers can significantly improve the overall performance of OFDMA systems, in terms of power efficiency and link throughput. A large body of work has focused on the joint subcarrier assignment and resource (bit and power) allocation for the OFDMA downlink. In this paper, we adopt a cross layer approach towards a network coding aware subcarrier assignment algorithm for the uplink and downlink of OFDMA based wireless networks. We formulate the maximal rate assignment problem as a mixed integer linear program and derive a polynomial time heuristic to approximate the solution. With network coding, it becomes possible to assign the same subcarrier to different downlinks without causing any interference. Consequently, our coding-aware assignment scheme improves the bandwidth efficiency and increases the network layer throughput by a substantial margin. We show that the total network throughput resulting from the heuristic is comparable to the optimal solution, with slight compromise of fairness. In addition, the coding aware subcarrier assignment mechanism can be applied to other multichannel wireless systems as well.","doi":"10.1109/NETCOD.2008.4476191","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth Workshop on Network Coding, Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth Workshop on Network Coding, Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4459055/4476167/04476191.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETCOD.2008.4476191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Network Coding and Subcarrier Assignment in OFDMA-Based WVireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476191","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476191/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Network Coding and Subcarrier Assignment in OFDMA-Based WVireless Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","accessionNumber":"9873277","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4476191/","conferenceDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Network Coding and Subcarrier Assignment in OFDMA-Based WVireless Networks","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"NETCOD-00-24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05131S","chronDate":"3-4 Jan. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4459055","isNumber":"4476167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4459055","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4476167","articleId":"4476191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4476197,"authors":[{"name":"Buyue Zhang","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4484077/4476197/4476197-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Buyue Zhang (S'98\u2013M'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, China, in 1999 and 2001, respectively, majoring in control theory and control engineering, and the Ph.D. degree from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 2007.","She is currently with the DSPS R&D center, Texas Instruments, Inc.

The ABF sharpens an image by increasing the slope of the edges without producing overshoot or undershoot. It is an approach to sharpness enhancement that is fundamentally different from the unsharp mask (USM). This new approach to slope restoration also differs significantly from previous slope restoration algorithms in that the ABF does not involve detection of edges or their orientation, or extraction of edge profiles. In the ABF, the edge slope is enhanced by transforming the histogram via a range filter with adaptive offset and width. The ABF is able to smooth the noise, while enhancing edges and textures in the image. The parameters of the ABF are optimized with a training procedure. ABF restored images are significantly sharper than those restored by the bilateral filter. Compared with an USM based sharpening method-the optimal unsharp mask (OUM), ABF restored edges are as sharp as those rendered by the OUM, but without the halo artifacts that appear in the OUM restored image. In terms of noise removal, ABF also outperforms the bilateral filter and the OUM. We demonstrate that ABF works well for both natural images and text images.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4484077/04476197.pdf","startPage":"664","endPage":"678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.919949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.919949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4484077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Bilateral Filter for Sharpness Enhancement and Noise Removal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Image restoration","Degradation","Image edge detection","Histograms","Rendering (computer graphics)","Image enhancement","Interpolation","Color","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","edge detection","image denoising","image enhancement","image restoration","image texture","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive bilateral filter","image sharpness enhancement","image noise removal","unsharp mask","slope image restoration","edge detection","edge profile extraction","histogram","image texture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilateral filter","de-blurring","noise removal","range filter","sharpness enhancement","slope restoration"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Graphics","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Information Storage and Retrieval","Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Bilateral Filter for Sharpness Enhancement and Noise Removal","volume":"17","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4476197/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921206","pubMedId":"18390373","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Bilateral Filter for Sharpness Enhancement and Noise Removal","sourcePdf":"17tip05-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094642S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4484077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"220","xplore-issue":"4484077","articleId":"4476197","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4476199,"authors":[{"name":"Juan A.

A neuromorphic programmable-kernel 2-D convolution chip has been reported where each pixel included two compact calibrated digital-to-analog converters (DACs) of 5-bit resolution, for currents down to picoamperes. Those DACs were based on MOS ladder structures, which although compact require 3N + 1 unit transistors (N is the number of calibration bits). Here, we present a new calibration approach not based on ladders, but on individually calibratable current sources made with MOS transistors of digitally adjustable length, which require only N-sized transistors. The scheme includes a translinear circuit-based tuning scheme, which allows us to expand the operating range of the calibrated circuits with graceful precision degradation, over four decades of operating currents. Experimental results are provided for 5-bit resolution DACs operating at 20 nA using two different translinear tuning schemes. Maximum measured precision is 5.05 and 7.15 b, respectively, for the two DAC schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.916864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4545018/04476199.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4545018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.916864","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 June 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476199/","displayDocTitle":"A Calibration Technique for Very Low Current and Compact Tunable Neuromorphic Cells: Application to 5-bit 20-nA DACs","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10058958","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4476199/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Calibration Technique for Very Low Current and Compact Tunable Neuromorphic Cells: Application to 5-bit 20-nA DACs","sourcePdf":"55tcsii06-lenerobardallo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079084S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4545018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4545018","articleId":"4476199","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4476201,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis L.

Vertical handoff is an important mechanism for achieving continuous seamless transmissions in these networks. In contrast to horizontal handoff, vertical handoff considers not only the received signal strength (RSS) but also the service-class mapping between handoff-in and handoff-out networks. Most previous works have adopted the RSS-based mechanism to determine handoff thresholds, which causes a serious ping-pong effect that increases unnecessary handoff. Although integrating the RSS-based mechanism with a hysteresis method reduces the unnecessary handoff, it suffers from high dropping [i.e., high Sum of Weighted Grade of Service (SWGoS)] and low utilization. Therefore, this paper proposes a cross-layer-based adaptive vertical handoff algorithm with predictive RSS to reduce the unnecessary handoff while significantly increasing utilization and decreasing connection dropping. The proposed approach determines the optimal target network in two phases, i.e., polynomial regression RSS prediction and Markov decision process analysis. Furthermore, fast changes in bandwidth caused by vertical handoff result in inaccurate Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control and, thus, reduce the TCP goodput. The cross-layer scheme provides a TCP receiver to reply to the TCP sender with the wireless network's protocol type. By using the cross-layer information, the TCP sender can accurately predict the available bandwidth and increase the network goodput. Numerical results indicate that the proposed cross-layer-based approach outperforms the other approaches in the number of vertical handoffs and SWGoS while yielding competitive utilization. In addition, the cross-layer scheme cooperates with existing TCP algorithms to increase goodput by up to 18%.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.921619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4665392/04476293.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.921619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665392","startPage":"3679","endPage":"3692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer-Based Adaptive Vertical Handoff With Predictive RSS in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer-Based Adaptive Vertical Handoff With Predictive RSS in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476293/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312137","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4476293/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer-Based Adaptive Vertical Handoff With Predictive RSS in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0543S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"94","articleId":"4476293","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4476295,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio A.

The latter can be exploited to enhance channel estimation accuracy or as an input for advanced mobile positioning systems. In this paper, we consider the uplink of a multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) network in which the base station is endowed with multiple receiving antennas arranged in a uniform linear array. Transmission takes place over a multipath channel, and the goal is the joint estimation of the channel responses and DOAs of the uplink signals. In doing so, we follow a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach and assume that users transmit orthogonal training sequences to facilitate the task of separating the signals. This way, all unknown parameters are estimated independently of each other with affordable complexity. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations are used to assess the performance of the proposed scheme and make comparisons with existing alternatives.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04476295.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.921624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.921624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel and DOA Estimation for Multicarrier CDMA Uplink Transmissions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction of arrival estimation","Multiaccess communication","Linear antenna arrays","Directive antennas","Antenna arrays","Wireless communication","Channel estimation","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Base stations","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","code division multiple access","maximum likelihood estimation","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DOA estimation","multicarrier CDMA uplink transmissions","antenna arrays","wireless communications","directions of arrival estimation","channel estimation","mobile positioning systems","multicarrier code-division multiple-access network","maximum-likelihood approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","direction of arrival (DOA) estimation","multicarrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA)"]},{"kwd":["Multicarrier CDMA","channel estimation","DOA estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel and DOA Estimation for Multicarrier CDMA Uplink Transmissions","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4476295/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10391718","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel and DOA Estimation for Multicarrier CDMA Uplink Transmissions","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-damico.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066995S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4476295","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4476296,"authors":[{"name":"Qiuming Gong","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4665392/4476296/4476296-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiuming Gong (S'07) was born in Quzhou, China, in 1982.

The plug-in HEV (PHEV), utilizing more battery power, has become a more attractive upgrade of the HEV. The charge-depletion mode is more appropriate for the power management of PHEVs, i.e., the state of charge (SOC) is expected to drop to a low threshold when the vehicle reaches the trip destination. Trip information has so far been considered as future information for vehicle operation and is thus not available \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">priori</i>\n. This situation can be changed by the recent advancement in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) based on the use of on-board global positioning systems (GPSs), geographical information systems (GISs), and advanced traffic flow modeling techniques. In this paper, a new approach to optimal power management of PHEVs in the charge-depletion mode is proposed with driving cycle modeling based on the historic traffic information. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is applied to reinforce the charge-depletion control such that the SOC drops to a specific terminal value at the end of the driving cycle. The vehicle model was based on a hybrid electric sport utility vehicle (SUV). Only fuel consumption is considered for the current stage of the study. A simulation study was conducted for several standard driving cycles and two trip models using the proposed method, and the results showed significant improvement in fuel economy compared with a rule-based control and a depletion sustenance control for most cases. Furthermore, the results showed much better consistency in fuel economy compared with rule-based and depletion sustenance control.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.921622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4665392/04476296.pdf","startPage":"3393","endPage":"3401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.921622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trip-Based Optimal Power Management of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476296/","displayDocTitle":"Trip-Based Optimal Power Management of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312147","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4476296/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trip-Based Optimal Power Management of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-gong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140339S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"259","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4476296","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4476297,"authors":[{"name":"Cyril-Daniel Iskander","affiliation":["Hi-Tek Multisystems, Quebec City, QC"],"firstName":"Cyril-Daniel","lastName":"Iskander","id":"38315044400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4476297","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Fading","Timing","Diversity reception","Delay estimation","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Modulation coding","Wideband","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","code division multiple access","error statistics","fading channels","modulation","Monte Carlo methods","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicode DS/CDMA","noncoherent M-ary orthogonal modulation","bit error rate","multicode direct-sequence code-division multiple access","wideband fading channels","timing errors","equal-gain combining","Monte Carlo system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IS-95B","multicode code-division multiple access (CDMA)","noncoherent detection","timing errors"]},{"kwd":["Multicode code-division multiple-access","noncoherent detection","timing errors","IS-95B"]}],"abstract":"This paper derives an accurate approximation to the bit error rate (BER) of multicode direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS/CDMA) with noncoherent \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n-ary modulation in wideband fading channels when timing errors are made at the receiver employing equal-gain combining (EGC).

In particular, we focus on the challenge of supporting potentially high-bandwidth commercial or infotainment communications between vehicles and the roadside in hotspots over several service channels, while concurrently enabling time-critical vehicle-vehicle communications for safety in a separate channel. In our architecture, within hotspots, the communication is aided by one of the access points in the hotspot. This access point is designated as the coordinating access point (CAP). Outside the hotspots, the communication is for safety only and is conducted in an ad hoc fashion. The CAP protocol design leverages IEEE 802.11 point coordination function (PCF) and distributed coordination function (DCF), which are modified for multichannel operation. The design objective is to maximize the utilization of the service channel that is used for nonsafety communications while meeting the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints of the safety communications. The performance of the IEEE 802.11 DCF and PCF and the CAP extension is quantified by simulation in NS-2. The mobility model represents a four-lane freeway at maximum vehicular traffic flow that is derived from the SHIFT traffic simulator. The CAP design is shown to significantly enhance the performance of safety and nonsafety communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4749378/04476298.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.921625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.921625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel Medium Access Control for Dedicated Short-Range Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Vehicle safety","Road safety","Automotive engineering","Traffic control","FCC","Safety devices","Access protocols","Road vehicles","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","IEEE standards","quality of service","radio networks","telecommunication standards","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel medium access control","MAC","dedicated short-range communications","coordinating access point","CAP protocol","IEEE 802.11","point coordination function","distributed coordination function","quality-of-service","QoS","vehicular traffic flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dedicated short-range communication (DSRC)","distributed coordination function (DCF)","IEEE 802.11","point coordination function (PCF)","vehicular communication","wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE)","wireless local area network (LAN)"]},{"kwd":["Wireless LAN","DSRC","WAVE","Vehicular Communication","IEEE 802.11","PCF","DCF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel Medium Access Control for Dedicated Short-Range Communications","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4476298/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10399803","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel Medium Access Control for Dedicated Short-Range Communications","sourcePdf":"58tvt01-mak.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07767S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4749378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4749378","articleId":"4476298","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4476300,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The probability density function of the detection variable is shown to be approximately Gamma distributed. All of the theoretical expressions and approximations are substantiated with simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10312170","htmlLink":"/document/4476300/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Prediction for Energy Detection of Unknown Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Prediction for Energy Detection of Unknown Signals","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-salt-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074279S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4476300","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4476302,"authors":[{"name":"Mu-King Tsay","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Mu-King","lastName":"Tsay","id":"37360161100"},{"name":"Ze-Shin Lee","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ze-Shin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37649195400"},{"name":"Chien-Hsing Liao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Hsing","lastName":"Liao","id":"37651626600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4476302","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Power control","Downlink","Flexible printed circuits","Rain fading","Fuzzy systems","Multiaccess communication","Interference","System performance","Input variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading channels","fuzzy control","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy power control","downlink code-division multiple-access","local multipoint distribution service system","rain fading effects","intercell interference","channel quality condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code division multiple access (CDMA)","fuzzy","local multipoint distribution service (LMDS)","power control"]},{"kwd":["CDMA","fuzzy","LMDS","power control"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel fuzzy power control (FPC) scheme to effectively improve the performance of the downlink code-division multiple-access (CDMA)-based local multipoint distribution service (LMDS) system. Conventional power control scheme is taken to reduce rain fading effects and intercell interference, and then increase the capacity of this LMDS system. To more effectively improve the system performance, three major factors (i.e., rain rate, path loss exponent depending on channel fading conditions, and number of subscribers in the interfering cell sectors) are taken as the input variables of fuzzy logic control in our proposed FPC scheme to obtain the channel quality condition and distance threshold for power control region adjustments. Simulation results show that our proposed FPC scheme performs better than the conventional scheme in terms of outage probability.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.921618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4665392/04476302.pdf","startPage":"3917","endPage":"3921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.921618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Power Control for Downlink CDMA-Based LMDS Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476302/","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Power Control for Downlink CDMA-Based LMDS Network","volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312178","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4476302/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Power Control for Downlink CDMA-Based LMDS Network","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-tsay-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058428S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4476302","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4476303,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Martini","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Martini","id":"37301735000"},{"name":"Massimo Donelli","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Donelli","id":"37274839500"},{"name":"Massimo Franceschetti","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Franceschetti","id":"37266395900"},{"name":"Andrea Massa","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Massa","id":"37274841000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4476303","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random media","Particle swarm optimization","Electromagnetic propagation","Electromagnetic modeling","Remote sensing","Communications technology","Scattering","Electromagnetic measurements","Soil","Radar remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","iterative methods","particle swarm optimisation","percolation","random media","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle density retrieval","random media","percolation model","particle swarm optimizer","electromagnetic measurement","wave propagation","iterative optimization","remote sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimizers (PSOs)","percolation theory","remote sensing","stratified random media"]},{"kwd":["Percolation theory","Stratified random media","Particle Swarm Optimizers (PSOs)","Remote sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476303","abstract":"This letter is a first attempt to apply a percolation theory model to the estimation of the density of particles in complex layered two-dimensional media from electromagnetic measurements.

The fiber position can be controlled in the two directions perpendicular to the fiber axis using two specifically designed wedges that can be accurately moved in-plane. These wedges are positioned using in-plane thermal actuators. Actuation of a fiber tip greater than 25 mum in-plane and 40 mum out-of-plane is achieved with a displacement resolution better than 0.1 m. After aligning the fiber the final position can be maintained by switching off the mechanical clamp, which also uses thermal actuators. The position of the fiber can be kept within 0.1 mum after switching off the mechanical clamp and the positioning actuator. Fiber-to-fiber alignment experiments have been performed and the technique can be extended to fiber-to-laser alignment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber devices","Clamps","Microassembly","Optical fibers","Assembly","Actuators","Costs","Manufacturing","Humans","Micromechanical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clamps","fibre lasers","microassembling","micromechanical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fiber positioning","clamping device","product-internal microassembly","microelectromechanical system","optical fiber","thermal actuator","displacement resolution","mechanical clamp","fiber-to-fiber alignment","fiber-to-laser alignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mechanical clamping","microactuators","microassembly","thermal actuation"]},{"kwd":["Mechanical clamping","microactuators","micro-assembly","thermal actuation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2008.918393","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4538081/04476306.pdf","startPage":"724","endPage":"734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4538081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2008.918393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional Fiber Positioning and Clamping Device for Product-Internal Microassembly","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional Fiber Positioning and Clamping Device for Product-Internal Microassembly","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476306/","volume":"17","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4476306/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10050642","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional Fiber Positioning and Clamping Device for Product-Internal Microassembly","sourcePdf":"17jmems03-henneken.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061084S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4538081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4538081","articleId":"4476306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4476307,"authors":[{"name":"Michael James Martin","affiliation":["U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Michael James Martin received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering, the M.A. degree in Asian studies (Japan), and the Ph.D. degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.","He is currently a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC.

Finally, the limiting case of vibrational velocities approaching the thermal velocity of the gas particles is considered, with analysis showing that these models are valid until the peak velocity of the vibration reaches 0.2c, where c is the thermal velocity of the gas.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2008.916321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2008.916321","startPage":"503","endPage":"511","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/4481154/04476307.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4481154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping Models for Microcantilevers, Bridges, and Torsional Resonators in the Free-Molecular-Flow Regime","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 April 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"Damping Models for Microcantilevers, Bridges, and Torsional Resonators in the Free-Molecular-Flow Regime","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2008","volume":"17","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4476307/","accessionNumber":"9921021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476307/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping Models for Microcantilevers, Bridges, and Torsional Resonators in the Free-Molecular-Flow Regime","sourcePdf":"17jmems02-martin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092371S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"4481154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4481154","articleId":"4476307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4476351,"authors":[{"name":"Francois Rivet","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Rivet","id":"37403070000"},{"name":"Yann Deval","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Deval","id":"37277062400"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Begueret","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Begueret","id":"37276436400"},{"name":"Dominique Dallet","affiliation":["IMS Laboratory, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Dallet","id":"37273699400"},{"name":"Philippe Cathelin","affiliation":["ST Microelectronics, Research and Development Center, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Cathelin","id":"37403070500"},{"name":"Didier Belot","affiliation":["ST Microelectronics, Research and Development Center, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Belot","id":"37268139100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4476351","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1015},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"The next generation of mobile terminals is faced with the emergence of the software-defined radio (SDR) concept. The communication devices tend to provide various wireless services through a multi-functional, multi-mode and multi-standard terminal. The SDR concept aims at designing a re-configurable radio architecture accepting all cellular or noncellular standards working in the 0-5-GHz frequency range. Some technical challenges have to be solved in order to address this concept. Working in the digital domain may be a solution but the analog-to-digital conversion cannot be done at Radio Frequencies, at an acceptable resolution and at an acceptable level of power consumption. The idea proposed here was to interface an analog pre-processing circuit between the antenna and a digital signal processor to pre-condition the RF signal. It uses the principle of a fast Fourier transform to carry out basic functions with high accuracy in a low-cost technology like CMOS. This paper presents the design and the behavioral simulations of this analog discrete-time device which gives the hardware flexibility required for a cognitive radio component.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4490082/04476351.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.919512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.919512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Disruptive Receiver Architecture Dedicated to Software-Defined Radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","CMOS technology","Mobile communication","Analog-digital conversion","Radio frequency","Signal resolution","Energy consumption","Circuits","Digital signal processors","Fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cognitive radio","fast Fourier transforms","radio receivers","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disruptive receiver architecture","software-defined radio","mobile terminals","wireless vices","multistandard terminal","multimode terminal","multifunctional terminal","reconfigurable radio architecture","analog-to-digital conversion","fast Fourier transform","discrete-time device","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog signal processing","cognitive radio","sampled analog signal processor","software-defined radio (SDR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Disruptive Receiver Architecture Dedicated to Software-Defined Radio","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4476351/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921370","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Disruptive Receiver Architecture Dedicated to Software-Defined Radio","sourcePdf":"55tcsii04-rivet.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058274S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4490082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4490082","articleId":"4476351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4476352,"authors":[{"name":"Arnaldo Spalvieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Arnaldo","lastName":"Spalvieri","id":"37268261400"},{"name":"Maurizio Magarini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Magarini","id":"37268262100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4476352","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":894},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Phase noise","Kalman filters","Steady-state","Delay estimation","Oscillators","Closed-form solution","Wiener filter","Books","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","least mean squares methods","oscillators","phase locked loops","phase noise","stochastic processes","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wieners analysis","discrete-time phase-locked loop","loop delay","phase noise","oscillators","stationary random waveform","loop filter optimization","minimum mean-square error","closed-form expressions","second-order disturbance","Costas loop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay effects","phase-locked loops (PLLs)","phase noise","synchronization","Wiener filtering"]}],"abstract":"The discrete-time phase-locked loop (PLL) operating at the steady state is considered in this paper.

The backscattered echoes are beamformed using delay-and-sum operations that cannot completely eliminate the contribution of signals backscattered by structures off the imaging beam to the beamsum. It leads to images with limited resolution and contrast. This paper presents an adaptation of the Capon beam- former algorithm to ultrasound medical imaging with focused beams. The strategy is to apply data-dependent weight functions to the imaging aperture. These weights act as lateral spatial filters that filter out off-axis signals. The weights are computed for each point in the imaged medium, from the statistical analysis of the signals backscattered by that point to the different elements of the imaging probe when insonifying it with different focused beams. Phantom and in vivo images are presented to illustrate the benefits of the Capon algorithm over the conventional delay-and-sum approach. On heart sector images, the clutter in the heart chambers is decreased. The endocardium border is better defined. On abdominal linear array images, significant contrast and resolution enhancement are observed.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2008.686","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/4476353/04476369.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2008.686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"619","endPage":"628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capon beamforming in medical ultrasound imaging with focused beams","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476369","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capon beamforming in medical ultrasound imaging with focused beams","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476369/","volume":"55","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4476369/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9906962","pubMedId":"18407851","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capon beamforming in medical ultrasound imaging with focused beams","sourcePdf":"t0830619.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051301S","chronDate":"March  2008","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"4476353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4476353","articleId":"4476369","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4476420,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Yeol Kim","affiliation":["Mechatronics and Manufacturing Technology Center, Samsung EIectronics Company, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4531695/4476420/4476420-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sung-Yeol Kim received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998, 2000, and 2006, respectively.","He is currently with the Mechatronics and Manufacturing Technology Center, Samsung Electronics Company, Suwon, Korea."]},"firstName":"Sung-Yeol","lastName":"Kim","id":"38128520500"},{"name":"In-Joong Ha","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4531695/4476420/4476420-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["In-Joong Ha (M'87) received the Ph.D. degree in computer, information, and control engineering (CICE) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1985.","From 1973 to 1981, he with the Agency of Defense Development, Taejon, Korea, working in the area of missile guidance and control.

Such transceivers are, however, sensitive to mismatches between the I and Q branches. These mismatches are unavoidable in any practical implementation, and result in finite attenuation of the mirror frequencies. In addition to the mirror-frequency interference problem, I/Q mismatches can severely compromise the performance of power amplifier linearization techniques based on pre-distortion. The effects of these impairments are becoming more pronounced as higher order modulated waveforms and/or more wideband multichannel signals are used. This brief focuses on digital-signal-processor-based I/Q mismatch calibration in wideband direct-conversion transmitters, assuming the challenging case of frequency-dependent I/Q mismatch. First, a novel widely linear (WL) calibration structure is introduced, suitable for frequency-dependent calibration. Then, two alternative principles for calibration parameter estimation are proposed. The first estimation approach stems from second-order statistics of complex communication signals, while the second technique is based on WL least-squares model fitting. Both estimators are shown by simulations to yield very good calibration performance. The obtainable performance is further assessed using laboratory RF signal measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4490082/04476448.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2008.919500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2008.919500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4490082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-Selective <emphasis>I/Q</emphasis> Mismatch Calibration of Wideband Direct-Conversion Transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Wideband","Frequency conversion","Radio transceivers","Attenuation","Mirrors","Interference","Broadband amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Linearization techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","least squares approximations","linearisation techniques","power amplifiers","radiofrequency interference","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-selective I/Q mismatch calibration","wideband direct-conversion transmitters","radio transceivers","mirror-frequency interference","power amplifier linearization techniques","wideband multichannel signals","widely linear calibration structure","widely linear least-squares model fitting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex signals and systems","digital radios","direct-conversion transceivers","I/Q imbalance","mirror-frequency interference","digital calibration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-Selective <emphasis>I/Q</emphasis> Mismatch Calibration of Wideband Direct-Conversion Transmitters","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4476448/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9921359","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-Selective <emphasis>I/Q</emphasis> Mismatch Calibration of Wideband Direct-Conversion Transmitters","sourcePdf":"55tcsii04-anttila.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060671S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4490082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"4490082","articleId":"4476448","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4476450,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37528454300"},{"name":"Ada S.

In some situations, even a small perturbation can result in a significant change to model behavior, depending on the model terminal conditions and the admittance matrix eigenvalues. This paper presents a new perturbation method that is significantly less prone to model corruption by focusing on the admittance matrix eigenvalues (modes), instead of elements. This is achieved by enforcing that the relative change to the eigenvalues is minimized in the least-squares sense. By combining this approach with precise passivity checking via the Hamiltonian matrix, a guaranteed passive model is obtained. The new approach (modal perturbation) is compared to previously developed methods in terms of perturbation size, model behavior, and computational efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2008.916764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/4476461/04476471.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2008.916764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476461","startPage":"768","endPage":"775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passivity Enforcement of Rational Models via Modal Perturbation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Passivity Enforcement of Rational Models via Modal Perturbation","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476471/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920714","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4476471/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passivity Enforcement of Rational Models via Modal Perturbation","sourcePdf":"23tpwrd02-gustavsen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068145S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"4476461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"4476461","articleId":"4476471","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4476476,"authors":[{"name":"Satoru Adachi","affiliation":["Texas Instruments Japan Limited, Ibaraki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4476475/4476476/4476476-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Satoru Adachi (M'00) was born in Ibaraki, Japan, in 1968.

Process and temperature variations in subthreshold circuits can cause dramatic fluctuations in performance and energy consumption and can lead to robustness problems. We investigate the use of body biasing to adapt to process and temperature variations. Test-chip measurements show that body biasing is particularly effective in subthreshold circuits and can eliminate performance variations with minimal energy penalties. Reduced performance is also problematic at low voltages, so we investigate global and local techniques for improving performance while maintaining energy efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4476475/04476487.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.917505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.917505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476475","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Variability and Performance in a Sub-200-mV Processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Temperature","Circuit testing","Sensor systems","Fluctuations","Energy consumption","Robustness","Energy measurement","Particle measurements","Low voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","low-power electronics","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subthreshold processor","ultra-low-energy sensor systems","subthreshold circuits","energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low voltage","process variation","sensor network processing","subthreshold"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Variability and Performance in a Sub-200-mV Processor","volume":"43","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4476487/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920652","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Variability and Performance in a Sub-200-mV Processor","sourcePdf":"43jssc04-hanson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103925S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4476475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4476475","articleId":"4476487","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4476488,"authors":[{"name":"Belal M.

Since 1972, he has led RAM circuit technology at Hitachi, Ltd. He was the lead designer of the first prototype for eight generations of Hitachi DRAMs ranging from 4 Kb to 64 Mb. in the course of the developments, he invented in 1974 the concept of folded data-line architecture, which uses a pair of balanced data lines to eliminate various noise components, and presented the architecture for a 64-Kb DRAM at the 1980 ISSCC. Since that time, this architecture has been adopted for nearly all DRAM chips since produced. He went on to develop key DRAM devices, circuits, and architectures such as three-dimensional-capacitor DRAMs, the triple-well structure, midpoint sensing, pipelined DRAM, multi-divided data-line, on-chip voltage down-converters enabling the aging (burn-in) stress test, transposed data-line, pMOS word driver, CMOS direct sensing, and high-voltage tolerant I/O. As early as 1988, as a pioneer, he initiated circuit inventions and developments to reduce subthreshold current of MOSFET's even for the active mode, which is highlighted today in low-voltage CMOS LSI design. Typical examples of the reduction circuits are multi-threshold (Vth) CMOS logic, various gate-source (self) back-biasing schemes, and power switch that we take for granted today.

A CT design allows for relaxed amplifier unity-gain frequency and power requirements, which can enable the realization of high-resolution modulators with bandwidths of several MHz or more at low power. It also provides the advantage of inherent anti-aliasing filtering. This paper introduces a hybrid CT/DT SigmaDelta modulator for A/D conversion that combines the benefits of CT and DT circuits, while mitigating the challenges associated with CT design. The second-order first stage of a two-stage cascade is implemented in CT, while the first-order second stage is a DT circuit. An experimental prototype of the proposed modulator, integrated in 0.18-mum CMOS technology, operates from a 1.2-V analog supply to allow for easier migration to a 0.13-mum or 90-nm CMOS technology. The prototype achieves a dynamic range of 77 dB, a peak SNR of 71 dB, a peak SNDR of 67 dB, and worst-case anti-aliasing filtering of 48 dB for a signal bandwidth of 7.5 MHz and a sampling rate of 240 MHz.

A new digital circuit has been developed to amplify the time residue with a higher gain (>16) and larger range (>80 ps) than existing solutions do. However, adapting the conventional coarse-fine architecture from ADCs is not an appropriate solution for TDCs: input time cannot be stored, and the gain of a time amplifier (TA) cannot be controlled precisely. This paper proposes a new coarse-fine TDC architecture by using an array of time amplifiers and two identical fine TDCs that compensate for the variation of the TA gain during the conversion process. The measured DNL and INL are plusmn0.8 LSB and plusmn3 LSB, respectively, with a value of 1.25 ps per 1 LSB, while the standard deviation of output code for constant inputs remains below 1 LSB across the TDC range. Although the nonlinearity is larger than 1 LSB, using an INL lookup table or better matched delays in the coarse TDC delay chain will improve the linearity further.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.917405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.917405","startPage":"769","endPage":"777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4476475/04476497.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 9 b, 1.25 ps Resolution Coarse\u2013Fine Time-to-Digital Converter in 90 nm CMOS that Amplifies a Time Residue","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 9 b, 1.25 ps Resolution Coarse\u2013Fine Time-to-Digital Converter in 90 nm CMOS that Amplifies a Time Residue","volume":"43","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9920662","publicationDate":"April 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4476497/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 9 b, 1.25 ps Resolution Coarse\u2013Fine Time-to-Digital Converter in 90 nm CMOS that Amplifies a Time Residue","sourcePdf":"43jssc04-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094196S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4476475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"320","xplore-issue":"4476475","articleId":"4476497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4476498,"authors":[{"name":"Simon M.

To reduce cell-to-cell interference which is well known as the most critical scaling barrier for NAND flash memories, a novel page architecture including temporary LSB storing program and parallel MSB program schemes is proposed. A BL voltage modulated ISPP scheme was used as parallel MSB programming in order to reduce cell-to-cell interference caused by the order in which the cells are programmed. By adopting the proposed page architecture, the number of neighbor cells that are programmed after programming a selected cell in BL direction as well as their amount of T/th shift during programming can be suppressed largely without increasing memory array size. Compared to conventional architecture it leads to a reduction of BL-BL cell-to-cell interference by almost 100%, and of WL-WL and diagonal cell-to-cell interferences by 50% at the 60 nm technology node. The proposed architecture enables also to improve average MLC program speed performance by 11% compared with conventional architecture, thanks to its fast LSB program performance.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.917558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4476475/04476506.pdf","startPage":"919","endPage":"928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.917558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Zeroing Cell-to-Cell Interference Page Architecture With Temporary LSB Storing and Parallel MSB Program Scheme for MLC NAND Flash Memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Zeroing Cell-to-Cell Interference Page Architecture With Temporary LSB Storing and Parallel MSB Program Scheme for MLC NAND Flash Memories","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476506/","publicationDate":"April 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9920669","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4476506/","volume":"43","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Zeroing Cell-to-Cell Interference Page Architecture With Temporary LSB Storing and Parallel MSB Program Scheme for MLC NAND Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"43jssc04-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08251S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4476475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4476475","articleId":"4476506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4476507,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Popplewell","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4476475/4476507/4476507-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter H.

Fabricated in a standard 0.13-m CMOS process, the test chips include the transceiver, the integrated antenna, the phase-locked loop (PLL) loop filter and supply decoupling. The transmitter and receiver consist of PLLs operated in both closed- and open-loop modes. Initially closed, the transmit PLL phase locks an RF voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), the loop is subsequently opened and the VCO is modulated to yield an FM output signal that radiates directly from the tank inductor that doubles as the integrated antenna. The closed-loop receiver phase locks an RF VCO which, in open-loop mode, is injection locked to the incoming FM signal and the PLL components serve to demodulate the signal. Averaged transmit and receive power consumptions are less than 1.1 mW, enabling on-chip ultracapacitors to serve as the power source. When one chip communicates using the on-chip antenna to another chip connected to an off-chip patch antenna the communication range is 1.8 m at 5 kb/s. The communication range can be increased at the expense of the data rate, or by using off-chip antennas with both chips.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4476475/04476507.pdf","startPage":"981","endPage":"990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.917516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.917516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476475","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5.2-GHz BFSK Transceiver Using Injection-Locking and an On-Chip Antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Phase locked loops","Voltage-controlled oscillators","RF signals","Radio frequency","Wireless sensor networks","Radiofrequency identification","CMOS process","Testing","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","injection locked oscillators","phase locked loops","transceivers","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BFSK transceiver","injection-locking","on-chip antenna","integrated transceiver design","CMOS process","phase-locked loop filter","supply decoupling","RF voltage-controlled oscillator","frequency 5.2 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Injection-locked oscillator","phase-locked loop (PLL)","on-chip integrated antenna","system on a chip","medical sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 5.2-GHz BFSK Transceiver Using Injection-Locking and an On-Chip Antenna","volume":"43","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4476507/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920670","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 5.2-GHz BFSK Transceiver Using Injection-Locking and an On-Chip Antenna","sourcePdf":"43jssc04-popplewell.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074864S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4476475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4476475","articleId":"4476507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4476510,"authors":[{"name":"Noboru Shibata","affiliation":["Memory Division, Toshiba Corporation Semiconductor Company, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4476475/4476510/4476510-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Noboru Shibata was born in Hokkaido, Japan, in 1968.

New programming method suppresses the floating gate coupling effect and enabled the narrow distribution for 16LC. The cache-program function can be achievable without any additional latches.

To achieve the fastest up-tracking speed, the maximum charging current control is introduced to charge up the output voltage with the maximum designed current.

Although the converter works with hysteretic voltage mode control, an adaptive delay compensation scheme is employed to keep the switching frequency constant at 850 kHz to within plusmn2.5% across the whole operation range. The integrated buck converter was fabricated using a 0.35 mum CMOS process. With an input voltage of 3 V, the output voltage can be regulated between 0.5 and 2.5 V. With a load resistor of 10 Omega, the up-tracking speed of the maximum reference step (0.5 to 2.5 V) is 12.5 mus/V.

Unfortunately, on-chip inductors are physically large and have poor series resistances, which result in low-efficiency converters. To mitigate this problem, on-chip magnetic coupling is exploited in the proposed stacked interleaved topology to enable the use of small (2 nH) on-chip inductors in a high-efficiency buck converter. The dramatic decrease in the inductance value is made possible by the unique bridge timing of the stacked design that causes magnetic coupling to boost the converter's efficiency by reducing the current ripple in each inductor. The magnetic coupling is realized by stacking the two inductors on top of one another, which not only lowers the required inductance, but also reduces the chip area consumed by the two inductors. The measured conversion efficiency for the prototype circuit, implemented in a 130-nm CMOS technology, shows more than a 15% efficiency improvement over a linear converter for low output voltages rising to a peak efficiency of 77.9 % for a 0.9 V output. These efficiencies are comparable to converters implemented with higher Q inductors, validating that the proposed techniques enable high-efficiency converters to be realized with small on-chip inductors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4476475/04476514.pdf","startPage":"844","endPage":"854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.917321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.917321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476475","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4476514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Efficiency DC\u2013DC Converter Using 2 nH Integrated Inductors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Buck converters","Inductance","CMOS technology","Topology","Bridge circuits","Timing","Coupling circuits","Stacking","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","DC-DC power convertors","inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC converter","integrated inductors","series resistances","stacked interleaved topology","inductance value","CMOS technology","linear converter","on-chip inductors","high-efficiency buck converter","on-chip magnetic coupling","size 130 nm","voltage 0.9 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetic coupling","ripple cancellation","switch-mode voltage regulator","synchronous rectification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4476514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A High-Efficiency DC\u2013DC Converter Using 2 nH Integrated Inductors","volume":"43","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4476514/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2008","accessionNumber":"9920677","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Efficiency DC\u2013DC Converter Using 2 nH Integrated Inductors","sourcePdf":"43jssc04-wibben.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04689S","chronDate":"April  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4476475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"4476475","articleId":"4476514","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4476598,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Feasel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Feasel","id":"37295178700"},{"name":"Mary C.

These resources provide both consumers and developers of technology with a common framework to objectively compare the performance of different algorithms and algorithmic improvements. In this paper, we present such a framework for evaluating object detection and tracking in video: specifically for face, text, and vehicle objects. This framework includes the source video data, ground-truth annotations (along with guidelines for annotation), performance metrics, evaluation protocols, and tools including scoring software and baseline algorithms. For each detection and tracking task and supported domain, we developed a 50-clip training set and a 50-clip test set. Each data clip is approximately 2.5 minutes long and has been completely spatially/temporally annotated at the I-frame level. Each task/domain, therefore, has an associated annotated corpus of approximately 450,000 frames. The scope of such annotation is unprecedented and was designed to begin to support the necessary quantities of data for robust machine learning approaches, as well as a statistically significant comparison of the performance of algorithms. The goal of this work was to systematically address the challenges of object detection and tracking through a common evaluation framework that permits a meaningful objective comparison of techniques, provides the research community with sufficient data for the exploration of automatic modeling techniques, encourages the incorporation of objective evaluation into the development process, and contributes useful lasting resources of a scale and magnitude that will prove to be extremely useful to the computer vision research community for years to come.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370791","htmlLink":"/document/4479472/","pubMedId":"19110496","displayDocTitle":"Framework for Performance Evaluation of Face, Text, and Vehicle Detection and Tracking in Video: Data, Metrics, and Protocol","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Framework for Performance Evaluation of Face, Text, and Vehicle Detection and Tracking in Video: Data, Metrics, and Protocol","sourcePdf":"ttp2009020319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146483S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4731221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"324","xplore-issue":"4731221","articleId":"4479472","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":4479477,"authors":[{"name":"Dacheng Tao","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4731221/4479477/4479477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nDacheng Tao received the BEng degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), the MPhil degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and the PhD degree from the University of London.

One of the most important subspace approaches is the linear dimensionality reduction step in the Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), which has been successfully employed in many fields such as biometrics, bioinformatics, and multimedia information management. However, the linear dimensionality reduction step in FLDA has a critical drawback: for a classification task with c classes, if the dimension of the projected subspace is strictly lower than c - 1, the projection to a subspace tends to merge those classes, which are close together in the original feature space. If separate classes are sampled from Gaussian distributions, all with identical covariance matrices, then the linear dimensionality reduction step in FLDA maximizes the mean value of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences between different classes. Based on this viewpoint, the geometric mean for subspace selection is studied in this paper. Three criteria are analyzed: 1) maximization of the geometric mean of the KL divergences, 2) maximization of the geometric mean of the normalized KL divergences, and 3) the combination of 1 and 2. Preliminary experimental results based on synthetic data, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and handwriting digits show that the third criterion is a potential discriminative subspace selection method, which significantly reduces the class separation problem in comparing with the linear dimensionality reduction step in FLDA and its several representative extensions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4731221/04479477.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.70","startPage":"260","endPage":"274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometric Mean for Subspace Selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479477/","displayDocTitle":"Geometric Mean for Subspace Selection","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4479477/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10370796","pubMedId":"19110492","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric Mean for Subspace Selection","sourcePdf":"ttp2009020260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106453S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4731221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"440","xplore-issue":"4731221","articleId":"4479477","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4479478,"authors":[{"name":"Shihao Ji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4731221/4479478/4479478-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\nShihao Ji received the BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from Duke University in 2006.

The associated estimation problem can typically be reduced to solving a set of fixed-point equations in the form of a \"natural-parameter homotopy.\" This paper applies a homotopy method to track a continuous path of solutions, starting from a local supervised solution (lambda = 0) to a local unsupervised solution (lambda = 1). The homotopy method is guaranteed to track with probability one from lambda = 0 to lambda = 1 if the lambda = 0 solution is unique; this condition is not satisfied for the HMM since the maximum likelihood supervised solution (lambda = 0) is characterized by many local optima. A modified form of the homotopy map for HMMs assures a track from lambda = 0 to lambda = 1. Following this track leads to a formulation for selecting lambda isin (0, 1) for a semisupervised solution and it also provides a tool for selection from among multiple local-optimal supervised solutions. The results of applying the proposed method to measured and synthetic sequential data verify its robustness and feasibility compared to the conventional EM approach for semisupervised HMM training.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.71","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4731221/04479478.pdf","startPage":"275","endPage":"287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semisupervised Learning of Hidden Markov Models via a Homotopy Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479478","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479478/","displayDocTitle":"Semisupervised Learning of Hidden Markov Models via a Homotopy Method","volume":"31","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370793","pubMedId":"19110493","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4479478/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semisupervised Learning of Hidden Markov Models via a Homotopy Method","sourcePdf":"ttp2009020275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076117S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4731221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4731221","articleId":"4479478","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":4479480,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4601506/4479480/4479480-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Li received the BS and MS degrees (with the honor of Outstanding Graduate) in computer science from Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

In this paper, we address the problem from a view which integrates conventional tracking and detection, and present a temporal probabilistic combination of discriminative observers of different lifespans. Each observer is learned from different ranges of samples, with different subsets of features, to achieve varying level of discriminative power at varying cost. An efficient fusion and temporal inference is then done by a cascade particle filter which consists of multiple stages of importance sampling. Experiments show significantly improved accuracy of the proposed approach in comparison with existing tracking methods, under the condition of low frame rate data and abrupt motion of both target and camera.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4601506/04479480.pdf","startPage":"1728","endPage":"1740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4601506","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking in Low Frame Rate Video: A Cascade Particle Filter with Discriminative Observers of Different Life Spans","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle tracking","Particle filters","Target tracking","Costs","Face detection","Monte Carlo methods","Cameras","Real time systems","Embedded system","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["importance sampling","object detection","particle filtering (numerical methods)","target tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low frame rate video","cascade particle filter","discriminative observers","object tracking","motion continuity","search space","fast appearance variation","importance sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vision and Scene Understanding","Motion"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Discriminant Analysis","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Motion","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Subtraction Technique","Video Recording"]},{"kwd":["Vision and Scene Understanding","Motion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Tracking in Low Frame Rate Video: A Cascade Particle Filter with Discriminative Observers of Different Life Spans","volume":"30","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4479480/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177349","pubMedId":"18703827","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking in Low Frame Rate Video: A Cascade Particle Filter with Discriminative Observers of Different Life Spans","sourcePdf":"ttp2008101728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079287S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4601506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"4601506","articleId":"4479480","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4479482,"authors":[{"name":"Oncel Tuzel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4601506/4479482/4479482-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oncel Tuzel received the BS and the MS degrees in computer engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1999 and 2002.

To define the edit operations, we use the paradigm of a graphical editing process and end up with a dynamic programming algorithm that we call time warp edit distance (TWED). TWED is slightly different in form from dynamic time warping (DTW), longest common subsequence (LCSS), or edit distance with real penalty (ERP) algorithms. In particular, it highlights a parameter that controls a kind of stiffness of the elastic measure along the time axis. We show that the similarity provided by TWED is a potentially useful metric in time series retrieval applications since it could benefit from the triangular inequality property to speed up the retrieval process while tuning the parameters of the elastic measure. In that context, a lower bound is derived to link the matching of time series into down sampled representation spaces to the matching into the original space. The empiric quality of the TWED distance is evaluated on a simple classification task. Compared to edit distance, DTW, LCSS, and ERP, TWED has proved to be quite effective on the considered experimental task.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.76","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4731221/04479483.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Warp Edit Distance with Stiffness Adjustment for Time Series Matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Time Warp Edit Distance with Stiffness Adjustment for Time Series Matching","volume":"31","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370798","pubMedId":"19110495","htmlLink":"/document/4479483/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Warp Edit Distance with Stiffness Adjustment for Time Series Matching","sourcePdf":"ttp2009020306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139656S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4731221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"4731221","articleId":"4479483","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4479484,"authors":[{"name":"Manuela Vasconcelos","affiliation":["Statical Visual Computing Laboratory, University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4731221/4479484/4479484-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manuela Vasconcelos received the Licenciatura in electrical engineering from the Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal, in 1986, the MS degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1993, and the PhD degree from Harvard University in 2003.

It is hypothesized that high-order dependences of bandpass features contain little information for discrimination of natural images. This hypothesis is characterized formally by the introduction of the concepts of conjunctive interference and decomposability order of a feature set. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the feasibility of low-complexity feature selection are then derived in terms of these concepts. It is shown that the intrinsic complexity of feature selection is determined by the decomposability order of the feature set and not its dimension. Feature selection algorithms are then derived for all levels of complexity and are shown to be approximated by existing information-theoretic methods, which they consistently outperform. The new algorithms are also used to objectively test the hypothesis of low decomposability order through comparison of classification performance. It is shown that, for image classification, the gain of modeling feature dependencies has strongly diminishing returns: best results are obtained under the assumption of decomposability order 1. This suggests a generic law for bandpass features extracted from natural images: that the effect, on the dependence of any two features, of observing any other feature is constant across image classes.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731221","startPage":"228","endPage":"244","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4731221/04479484.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479484","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Computer vision","Biological information theory","Biological system modeling","Data mining","Object recognition","Biology computing","Probability","Histograms","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","feature extraction","image classification","information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural image statistics","low-complexity feature selection","visual recognition","intrinsic complexity","decomposability order","image classification","bandpass feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature extraction and construction","low complexity","natural image statistics","information theory","feature discrimination versus dependence","image databases","object recognition","texture","perceptual reasoning."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Models, Statistical","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]},{"kwd":["Feature extraction or construction","Low-complexity","Natural Image Statistics","Information theory","Feature Discrimination vs Dependence","Image databases","Object recognition","Texture","Perceptual reasoning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Natural Image Statistics and Low-Complexity Feature Selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370794","pubMedId":"19110490","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4479484/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479484/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural Image Statistics and Low-Complexity Feature Selection","sourcePdf":"ttp2009020228.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147572S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4731221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4731221","articleId":"4479484","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4479492,"authors":[{"name":"Agustin Dominguez-Oviedo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Agustin","lastName":"Dominguez-Oviedo","id":"38314510600"},{"name":"M.

For security reasons, especially to provide resistance against fault-based attacks, it is very important to verify the correctness of computations in ECC applications. In this paper, error-detecting and fault-tolerant elliptic curve cryptosystems are considered. Error detection may be a sufficient countermeasure for many security applications; however, fault-tolerant characteristic enables a system to perform its normal operation in spite of faults. For the purpose of detecting errors due to faults, a number of schemes and hardware structures are presented based on recomputation or parallel computation. It is shown that these structures can be used for detecting errors with a very high probability during the computation of the elliptic curve scalar multiplication (ECSM). Additionally, we show that using parallel computation along with either PV or recomputation, it is possible to have fault-tolerant structures for the ECSM. If certain conditions are met, these schemes are more efficient than others such as the well-known triple modular redundancy. Prototypes of the proposed structures for error detection and fault tolerance have been implemented, and experimental results have been presented.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2008.21","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/5194561/04479492.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2008.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5194561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Detection and Fault Tolerance in ECSM Using Input Randomization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479492/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Error Detection and Fault Tolerance in ECSM Using Input Randomization","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10806569","htmlLink":"/document/4479492/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Detection and Fault Tolerance in ECSM Using Input Randomization","sourcePdf":"ttq2009030175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031805S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2009","isNumber":"5194561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4479492","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4479494,"authors":[{"name":"Steffen Peter","affiliation":["IHP GmBH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Peter","id":"37297111100"},{"name":"Dirk Westhoff","affiliation":["NEC Europe Limited, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Westhoff","id":"37332334000"},{"name":"Claude Castelluccia","affiliation":["Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique, Saint Ismier, France"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Castelluccia","id":"37298585000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-5971"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0018"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9209"}],"articleNumber":"4479494","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":880},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Wireless sensor networks","Telecommunication traffic","Data security","Vehicle safety","Energy consumption","Spine","Biomedical monitoring","Ad hoc networks","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","telecommunication computing","telecommunication traffic","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergecast traffic","in-network processing","end-to-end encryption solutions","wireless sensor networks","energy consumption","system security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryptography","wireless sensor networks","convergecast","concealed data aggregation."]},{"kwd":["Sensor networks","Security and Privacy Protection"]}],"abstract":"We present an overview of end-to-end encryption solutions for convergecast traffic in wireless sensor networks that support in-network processing at forwarding intermediate nodes.

Extensive experiments for a number of problems show that normalization transforms the uncorrelated search spaces to correlated ones and leads to significant improvement in performance.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2007.913699","startPage":"604","endPage":"616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2007.913699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4633700","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/4633700/04479500.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Normalization for Genetic Algorithms With Nonsynonymously Redundant Encodings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479500/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Normalization for Genetic Algorithms With Nonsynonymously Redundant Encodings","volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4479500/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10235638","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Normalization for Genetic Algorithms With Nonsynonymously Redundant Encodings","sourcePdf":"12tevc05-choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117237S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4633700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4633700","articleId":"4479500","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4479503,"authors":[{"name":"Yiping Xing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yiping","lastName":"Xing","id":"37270853100"},{"name":"R.

Recently, noncooperative game theory has been applied to investigate interesting solutions to this problem. The majority of these studies assumes that the transmitter power level can take values in a continuous domain. However, recent trends such as the GSM standard and Qualcomm's proposal to the IS-95 standard use a finite number of discretized power levels. This motivates the need to investigate solutions for distributed discrete power control which is the primary objective of this paper. We first note that, by simply discretizing, the previously proposed continuous power adaptation techniques will not suffice. This is because a simple discretization does not guarantee convergence and uniqueness. We propose two probabilistic power adaptation algorithms and analyze their theoretical properties along with the numerical behavior. The distributed discrete power control problem is formulated as an N-person, nonzero sum game. In this game, each user evaluates a power strategy by computing a utility value. This evaluation is performed using a stochastic iterative procedures. We approximate the discrete power control iterations by an equivalent ordinary differential equation to prove that the proposed stochastic learning power control algorithm converges to a stable Nash equilibrium. Conditions when more than one stable Nash equilibrium or even only mixed equilibrium may exist are also studied. Experimental results are presented for several cases and compared with the continuous power level adaptation solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Learning Solution for Distributed Discrete Power Control Game in Wireless Data Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.911424","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4600145/04479503.pdf","startPage":"932","endPage":"944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.911424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4600145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Learning Solution for Distributed Discrete Power Control Game in Wireless Data Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10158062","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Learning Solution for Distributed Discrete Power Control Game in Wireless Data Networks","sourcePdf":"16tnet04-xing.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039096S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","isNumber":"4600145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"86","articleId":"4479503","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4479504,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Brzezinski","affiliation":["Fidelity Investments, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4706507/4479504/4479504-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrew Brzezinski received the B.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2000, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA.","He is currently with Fidelity Investments, Boston, MA."]},"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Brzezinski","id":"37272559400"},{"name":"Gil Zussman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4706507/4479504/4479504-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Gil Zussman (S'02\u2013M'05\u2013SM'07) received the B.Sc. degree in industrial engineering and management and the B.A. degree in economics from the Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, in 1995 (both summa cum laude).

Recently, a number of distributed scheduling algorithms for wireless networks have emerged. Due to their distributed operation, these algorithms can achieve only a fraction of the maximum possible throughput. As an alternative to increasing the throughput fraction by designing new algorithms, we present a novel approach that takes advantage of the inherent multi-radio capability of WMNs. We show that this capability can enable partitioning of the network into subnetworks in which simple distributed scheduling algorithms can achieve 100% throughput. The partitioning is based on the notion of Local Pooling. Using this notion, we characterize topologies in which 100% throughput can be achieved distributedly. These topologies are used in order to develop a number of centralized channel assignment algorithms that are based on a matroid intersection algorithm. These algorithms pre-partition a network in a manner that not only expands the capacity regions of the subnetworks but also allows distributed algorithms to achieve these capacity regions. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms via simulation and show that they significantly increase the distributedly achievable capacity region. We note that while the identified topologies are of general interference graphs, the partitioning algorithms are designed for networks with primary interference constraints.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2008.918109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4706507","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4706507/04479504.pdf","endPage":"1419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Throughput Maximization in Wireless Mesh Networks via Pre-Partitioning","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2008.918109","startPage":"1406","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Throughput Maximization in Wireless Mesh Networks via Pre-Partitioning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479504/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10361239","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4479504/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Throughput Maximization in Wireless Mesh Networks via Pre-Partitioning","sourcePdf":"16tnet06-brzezinski.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089867S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4706507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4706507","articleId":"4479504","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":4479506,"authors":[{"name":"Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4490093/4479506/4479506-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny (M'84\u2013SM'90) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Teheran University, Iran, in 1976, the M.Eng. degree from University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology, U.K., in 1977, and the Ph.D. degree from Imperial College, University of London, U.K., in 1981.","From 1981 to 1989, he was with the Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran.

We thus modify the sensing step by introducing a special sensing dictionary. The correct selection of components is then determined by the cross cumulative coherence which can be considerably lower than the cumulative coherence.

These filters allow for almost arbitrary wavelength filtering, yet they are more compact than previous demonstrations of BSG. The filters are designed using a combination of Boolean particle swarm optimization (B-PSO) and a one-dimensional transfer matrix method. To demonstrate the compact device size, several 50-mum-long single-wavelength transmission filters are demonstrated theoretically, each having a different wavelength while using the same structural parameters. A multiwavelength filter is also proposed in an 80-mum-long structure to show the versatility of the large refractive index step BSG. A genetic algorithm is substituted for the B-PSO; however, B-PSO shows better performance here. This work may be applied to produce compact optical filters for intrachip optical networks and compact tunable lasers, while using existing single-step photolithography processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479612/","volume":"20","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4479612/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2008","accessionNumber":"9920979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Proposal for Compact Optical Filters Using Large Index Step Binary Supergratings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposal for Compact Optical Filters Using Large Index Step Binary Supergratings","sourcePdf":"20lpt09-afshinmanesh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081954S","chronDate":"May1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4479611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4479611","articleId":"4479612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4479618,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In ORGAs, although a large virtual gate count can be realized by exploiting the large-capacity storage capability of a holographic memory, the actual gate count, which is the gate count of a programmable gate array VLSI, is important to increase the instantaneous performance. Nevertheless, in previously proposed ORGA-VLSIs, the static configuration memory to store a single configuration context consumed a large implementation area of the ORGA-VLSIs and prevented the realization of large-gate-count ORGA-VLSIs. Therefore, a DORGA architecture has been proposed in order to increase the gate density. It uses the junction capacitance of photodiodes as dynamic memory, thereby obviating the static configuration memory. However, to date, demonstration of a perfect optically reconfigurable architecture for DORGA-VLSIs has never been presented. Therefore, in this study, the DORGA architecture was perfectly emulated, and the performance, particularly the reconfiguration context retention time, was measured experimentally. The advantages of this architecture are discussed in relation to the results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/4459775/04479645.pdf","startPage":"493","endPage":"500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2008.916705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2008.916705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4459775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Optically Reconfigurable Gate Array\u2014Perfect Emulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical arrays","Emulation","Holography","Holographic optical components","Very large scale integration","Capacitance","Photodiodes","Reconfigurable architectures","Particle measurements","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","holographic storage","optical logic","photodiodes","reconfigurable architectures","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic optically reconfigurable gate array","DORGA","holographic memory","ORGA-VLSI","programmable gate array","static configuration memory","junction capacitance","photodiodes","dynamic memory","reconfiguration context retention time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)","holographic memories","optical data processing","programmable logic devices","semiconductor laser arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Optically Reconfigurable Gate Array\u2014Perfect Emulation","volume":"44","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4479645/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"10006633","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Optically Reconfigurable Gate Array\u2014Perfect Emulation","sourcePdf":"44jqe05-seto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142753S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"4459775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4459775","articleId":"4479645","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4479648,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald A Arif","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ronald A.

Fermi's golden rule indicates that InGaN QW with step-function like In content in the well leads to significantly improved radiative recombination rate and optical gain due to increased electron-hole wavefunction overlap, in comparison to that of conventional InGaN QW. Spontaneous emission spectra of both conventional and staggered InGaN QW were calculated based on energy dispersion and transition matrix element obtained by 6-band k middotp formalism for wurtzite semiconductor, taking into account valence-band-states mixing, strain effects, and polarization-induced electric fields. The calculated spectra for the staggered InGaN QW showed enhancement of radiative recombination rate, which is in good agreement with photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence measurements at emission wavelength regime of 425 and 500 nm. Experimental results of light-emitting diode (LED) structures utilizing staggered InGaN QW also show significant improvement in output power. Staggered InGaN QW allows polarization engineering leading to improved luminescence intensity and LED output power as a result of enhanced radiative recombination rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/4479646/04479648.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2008.918309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2008.918309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spontaneous Emission and Characteristics of Staggered InGaN Quantum-Well Light-Emitting Diodes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spontaneous emission","Quantum wells","Light emitting diodes","Radiative recombination","Optical polarization","Power generation","Chemical vapor deposition","Lead compounds","Stimulated emission","Optical mixing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cathodoluminescence","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","light emitting diodes","MOCVD","photoluminescence","semiconductor quantum wells","spontaneous emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["InGaN quantum-well light-emitting diodes","metal-organic chemical vapor deposition","visible light emitters","Fermi's golden rule","radiative recombination rate","electron-hole wavefunction overlap","spontaneous emission spectra","energy dispersion","transition matrix element","wurtzite semiconductor","photoluminescence measurements","cathodoluminescence measurements","polarization engineering","luminescence intensity","wavelength 425 nm","wavelength 500 nm","InGaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gain media","III\u2013nitride","InGaN quantum wells (QWs)","light-emitting diodes (LEDs)","polarization field engineering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spontaneous Emission and Characteristics of Staggered InGaN Quantum-Well Light-Emitting Diodes","volume":"44","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4479648/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10006222","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spontaneous Emission and Characteristics of Staggered InGaN Quantum-Well Light-Emitting Diodes","sourcePdf":"44jqe06-arif.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093016S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"4479646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4479646","articleId":"4479648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4479657,"authors":[{"name":"Frantisek Ondracek","affiliation":["AS CR, Prague, Czech Republic"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/4479646/4479657/4479657-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Franti\u0161ek Ondr\u00e1\u010dek received the M.Sc. degree in electronics from the Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic, in 2002.

Existing solutions imply the use of specialized memories or assume error free environments. This is either unrealistic or impractical in many industrial situations. In this paper, we propose an architecture which implements classic low power encoding but uses industry standard DRAMs. Moreover, the low power encoding is combined with error-protection in order to extend the application to noisy channels or to the presence of soft and hard failures in the memory. Parallelism between the two encoding processes avoids any latency adder. Our experimental results, based on current consumption measurements of DDR2 DRAM components in mass production, show savings up to 31% on the I/O power and 6% on the total memory energy of a single channel memory system of 4 GB at practically no cost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Random access memory","Bismuth","Energy consumption","Costs","Error correction codes","Computer errors","Working environment noise","Power system interconnection","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","encoding","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error protection","data bus inversion","standard DRAM components","low power encoding","noisy channels","I/O power","total memory energy","single channel memory system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","memory","low power","reliability","error protection","ECC","bus inversion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479694","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479694","startPage":"35","endPage":"42","publicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4479672/4479673/04479694.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479694/","displayDocTitle":"Error Protected Data Bus Inversion Using Standard DRAM Components","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9896389","htmlLink":"/document/4479694/","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Protected Data Bus Inversion Using Standard DRAM Components","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3117a035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088682S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4479672","isNumber":"4479673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4479672","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4479673","articleId":"4479694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4479696,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago Muller Gil Cardoso","affiliation":["Instituto de Inform\u00e1tica, UFRGS, Brazil"],"firstName":"Tiago Muller Gil","lastName":"Cardoso","id":"37087752528"},{"name":"Felipe de Souza Marques","affiliation":["Nangate Inc."],"firstName":"Felipe de Souza","lastName":"Marques","id":"37395395600"},{"name":"Renato Perez Ribas","affiliation":["UFRGS Instituto de Inform\u00e1tica"],"firstName":"Renato Perez","lastName":"Ribas","id":"37265307400"},{"name":"Andre Inacio Reis","affiliation":["Nangate Inc."],"firstName":"Andre Inacio","lastName":"Reis","id":"37265300800"},{"name":"Leomar Soares da Rosa","affiliation":["Inst. de Inf. - UFRGS, Porto Alegre"],"firstName":"Leomar Soares","lastName":"da Rosa","id":"38190055200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3117-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4479696","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Network synthesis","Table lookup","Delay","Data structures","Boolean functions","Logic circuits","Costs","Network topology","Circuit topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","binary decision diagrams","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","logic design","transistor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC","FPGA","transistor network synthesis","transistor reordering","four-input networks","logic styles","transistor topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transistor networks","logic synthesis","BDDs","Logical effort"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a method for speeding-up ASICs by transistor reordering.

Accordingly, leakage power reduction during data-retention in SRAM standby is often addressed by reducing the supply voltage. Each SRAM cell has a minimum supply voltage parameter called the data-retention voltage (DRV), above which the stored bit can be retained reliably. The DRV exhibits significant intra-chip variation in the deep sub-micron era. As supply voltage is lowered, leakage power reduces, but a larger fraction of SRAM cells is prone to retention failures. Use of appropriate error-correction to mitigate cell- reliability is proposed. Using this approach, the standby supply voltage is selected to minimize leakage power per useful bit. The fundamental limits on the leakage power per useful bit, while taking the DRV distribution into account, are established. Minimization of power per bit results in a supply-voltage at which a small fraction of cells fail to retain the data. For experimental DRV -distributions, a [31,26,3] Hamming code based implementation achieves a significant portion of the leakage power reduction compared to the fundamental limit. These analytical results are verified by twenty-four experimental chips manufactured in an industrial 90 nm CMOS process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4479705/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","accessionNumber":"9896399","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Data Retention Limits in SRAM Standby Experimental Results","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Data Retention Limits in SRAM Standby Experimental Results","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3117a092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094236S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4479672","isNumber":"4479673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4479672","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4479673","articleId":"4479705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4479706,"authors":[{"name":"Hidehiro Fujiwara","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidehiro","lastName":"Fujiwara","id":"37532906000"},{"name":"Shunsuke Okumura","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Okumura","id":"37604798700"},{"name":"Yusuke Iguchi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Iguchi","id":"37663802100"},{"name":"Hiroki Noguchi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Noguchi","id":"37532700600"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Morita","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Morita","id":"37684518500"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kawaguchi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kawaguchi","id":"37270375100"},{"name":"Masahiko Yoshimoto","affiliation":["Kobe Daigaku, Kobe, Hyogo, JP"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Yoshimoto","id":"37269600500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3117-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4479706","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479706","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Application software","Stability","Bit error rate","Cryptography","Silicon","Negative bias temperature instability","Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of a bit","dependable SRAM","memory cells","high speed mode","Monte Carlo simulation","dynamic cell stability","90 nm process technology","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","Quality of a bit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479706","publicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4479672/4479673/04479706.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality of a Bit (QoB): A New Concept in Dependable SRAM","abstract":"We propose a novel dependable SRAM with 7T memory cells, and introduce a new concept, \"quality of a bit (QoB)\" for it.

Our strategy is to improve the noise margin of the 6T SRAM cell by reducing the effect of parametric variation of the cell [4], especially in the low voltage operation mode. This is done using a novel circuit that selectively reduces the voltage swing on the world line and reduces the memory supply voltage during write operation.

In this paper, we present a compact model for critical charge of a 6T SRAM cell for estimating the effects of process variations on its soft error susceptibility. The model is based on dynamic behavior of the cell and a simple decoupling technique for the non-linearly coupled storage nodes. The model describes the critical charge in terms of transistor parameters, cell supply voltage, and injected current parameters. Consequently, it enables investigating the spread of critical charge due to process induced variations in these parameters and to manufacturing defects, such as, resistive contacts or vias. In addition, the model can estimate the improvement in critical charge when MIM capacitors are added to the cell in order to improve the soft error robustness. The critical charge calculated by the model is in good agreement with SPICE simulations for a commercial 90 nm CMOS process with a maximum discrepancy of less than 5%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479727/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4479727/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9896421","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Process Impact on Soft Error Susceptibility of Nanometric SRAMs Using a Compact Critical Charge Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Process Impact on Soft Error Susceptibility of Nanometric SRAMs Using a Compact Critical Charge Model","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3117a207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063842S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4479672","isNumber":"4479673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4479672","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4479673","articleId":"4479727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4479728,"authors":[{"name":"Savithri Sundareswaran","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Savithri","lastName":"Sundareswaran","id":"37283478500"},{"name":"Jacob A.

Statistical characterization need to be performed efficiently with acceptable accuracy as a function of several process and environment parameter variations. In this paper, we propose an approach to consider intra-cell process mismatch variations to characterize a cell's delay and output transition time (output slew) variations. A straightforward approach to address this problem is to model these mismatch variations by characterizing for each device fluctuation separately. However, the runtime complexity for such characterization becomes of the order of number of devices in the cell and the number of simulations required can easily become infeasible. We analyze the fluctuations in switching and non-switching devices and their impact on delay variations. Using these properties of the devices, we propose a clustering approach to characterize for cell's delay variations due to intra-cell mismatch variations. The proposed approach results in as much as 12X runtime improvements with acceptable accuracy, compared with Monte Carlo simulations. We show that this approach ensures an upper-bound on the results while keeping the number of simulations for each cell independent of the number of devices.","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479728","publicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4479672/4479673/04479728.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479673","startPage":"213","endPage":"219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of Standard Cells for Intra-Cell Mismatch Variations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of Standard Cells for Intra-Cell Mismatch Variations","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479728/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9896422","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4479728/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of Standard Cells for Intra-Cell Mismatch Variations","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3117a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057878S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4479672","isNumber":"4479673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4479672","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4479673","articleId":"4479728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4479747,"authors":[{"name":"Ricky Yiu-kee Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ricky Yiu-kee","lastName":"Choi","id":"37574699100"},{"name":"Chi-ying Tsui","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi-ying","lastName":"Tsui","id":"37278549800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3117-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4479747","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":492},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Capacitors","Voltage","Energy resolution","Decoding","Binary trees","Capacitance","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successive approximation register","analogue-digital conversion","DAC capacitor arrays","CMOS process","word length 10 bit","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low Power","Successive Approximation Register ADC"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new method for switching the capacitors in the DAC capacitor array of a successive approximation register (SAR) ADC.

Thus far, thermal simulations have been limited to steady-state worst case conditions, which have caused the use of conservative margins in thermal designs. Transient temperature characteristics were not simulated in prior art chip-level simulations due to the high computational expense. To drastically reduce the time for the chip-level thermal simulations, we have developed a matrix convolution technique, called the Power Blurring (PB) method. Our method renders the temperature profile of a packaged IC with maximum error less than 3% for several case studies done and reduces the computation time by a factor of 100, compared to the simulations done by the industry standard finite element tools.","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479805","publicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4479672/4479673/04479805.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479673","startPage":"600","endPage":"603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Evaluation Method for Transient Hot Spots in VLSI ICs in Packages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Evaluation Method for Transient Hot Spots in VLSI ICs in Packages","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479805/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9896499","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4479805/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Evaluation Method for Transient Hot Spots in VLSI ICs in Packages","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3117a600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070808S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4479672","isNumber":"4479673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4479672","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4479673","articleId":"4479805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4479820,"authors":[{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Seagate Technology Limited Liability Company, USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"},{"name":"Xiaobin Wang","affiliation":["Seagate Technology Limited Liability Company, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311498100"},{"name":"Hai Li","affiliation":["Seagate Technology Limited Liability Company, USA"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Li","id":"37407153400"},{"name":"Harry Liu","affiliation":["Seagate Technology Limited Liability Company, USA"],"firstName":"Harry","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279500700"},{"name":"Dimitar V.

Sensitivities of the cell yield to device design uncertainties and process variations are evaluated. Statistical analysis indicates that column-decoupled cells can help lower the stability requirement on the cell beta ratio and hence relax the design limitations with FinFET technology such as quantization penalties. Furthermore, physical cell image diagrams show that the 6T-decoupled cell suffers very small area penalties compared to the traditional double gate designs. Fast statistical analysis techniques are used to estimate yield trend. Numerical device/circuit mix-mode simulations support the predicted trends. Threshold voltage variations due to random dopant fluctuations are estimated using a macroscopic modeling method. The impact of fin-height variations is also evaluated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Evaluation of Split Gate Opportunities for Improved 8T/6T Column-Decoupled SRAM Cell Yield","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479823","startPage":"702","endPage":"707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479673","publicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4479672/4479673/04479823.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2008","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Evaluation of Split Gate Opportunities for Improved 8T/6T Column-Decoupled SRAM Cell Yield","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4479823/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"9896517","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Evaluation of Split Gate Opportunities for Improved 8T/6T Column-Decoupled SRAM Cell Yield","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3117a702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053419S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4479672","isNumber":"4479673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4479672","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4479673","articleId":"4479823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4479834,"authors":[{"name":"Wenping Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Wenping","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292861300"},{"name":"Shengqi Yang","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Shengqi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292119900"},{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37277285000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3117-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3287"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3295"}],"articleNumber":"4479834","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":346},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479834","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit analysis computing","Timing","Circuit analysis","Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Degradation","Protection","Negative bias temperature instability","Delay effects","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit stability","CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit reliability","thermal stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["node criticality computation","circuit timing analysis","negative bias temperature instability effect","NBTI delay degradation","circuit delay degradation","NBTI aware timing analysis","CMOS technology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479834","endPage":"768","startPage":"763","publicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","displayPublicationTitle":"9th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (isqed 2008)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4479672/4479673/04479834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISQED.2008.4479834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4479673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Node Criticality Computation for Circuit Timing Analysis and Optimization under NBTI Effect","abstract":"For sub-65 nm technology nodes, Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) has become a primary limiting factor of circuit lifetime. During the past few years, researchers have spent considerable and continuous efforts on modeling and characterization of NBTI-caused delay degradation at different design levels. Searching for solutions which can effectively reduce NBTI impact on circuit delay is still under way. In this work, we use node criticality computation to drive NBTI aware timing analysis and optimization. Circuits after being applied this optimization flow show strong resistance to NBTI delay degradation. Particularly, for the first time, we propose node criticality computation algorithm under the NBTI aware timing analysis and optimization framework and give answers to the following questions which have not been answered yet. They are: (1) how to define node criticality in a circuit under NBTI effect; (2) how to find the critical nodes which once are protected NBTI timing degradation will be effectively reduced. Experimental results show that by protecting the critical nodes found by this framework, circuit delay degradation can be reduced by up to 50%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 March 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479834/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4479834/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9896528","conferenceDate":"17-19 March 2008","publicationDate":"March 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Node Criticality Computation for Circuit Timing Analysis and Optimization under NBTI Effect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node Criticality Computation for Circuit Timing Analysis and Optimization under NBTI Effect","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3117a763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071353S","chronDate":"17-19 March 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4479672","isNumber":"4479673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4479672","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4479673","articleId":"4479834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4479850,"authors":[{"name":"Sherif A.

The prior knowledge, referred to as long-term memory (LTM), is expressed in the form of equality constraints obtained by means of an algebraic training technique. Incremental training, which may be used to learn new short-term memories (STMs) online, is then formulated as an error minimization problem subject to equality constraints. The solution of this problem is simplified by implementing an adjoined error gradient that circumvents direct substitution and exploits classical backpropagation. A target application is neural network function approximation in adaptive critic designs. For illustrative purposes, constrained training is implemented to update an adaptive critic flight controller, while preserving prior knowledge of an established performance baseline that consists of classical gain-scheduled controllers. It is shown both analytically and numerically that the LTM is accurately preserved while the controller is repeatedly trained over time to assimilate new STMs.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2007.915108","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4531603/04479860.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.915108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4531603","startPage":"996","endPage":"1009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Constrained Optimization Approach to Preserving Prior Knowledge During Incremental Training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Constrained Optimization Approach to Preserving Prior Knowledge During Incremental Training","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479860/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 March 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10006127","pubMedId":"18541500","dateOfInsertion":"28 May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4479860/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Constrained Optimization Approach to Preserving Prior Knowledge During Incremental Training","sourcePdf":"19tnn06-ferrari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101299S","chronDate":"June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4531603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4531603","articleId":"4479860","onlineDate":"31 March 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4479863,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Kuang Chen","affiliation":["Microprocessor Technology Labs, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4490117/4479863/4479863-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yen-Kuang Chen (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ.","He is a Principal Engineer with the Corporate Technology Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the modeling and controller design problem for fixed-frequency DC-DC converters, using a synchronous step-down DC-DC converter as an illustrative example. We introduce a hybrid converter model that is valid for the whole operating regime. Based on this model, we formulate and solve a constrained optimal control problem. To make the scheme implementable, we derive offline the explicit state-feedback control law, which can be easily stored and implemented in a lookup table.

Recently, overlapped message passing (OMP) decoding has been proposed to improve the throughput and hardware utilization efficiency (HUE) of decoder architectures for LDPC codes. In this paper, we first study the scheduling for the OMP decoding of LDPC codes, and show that maximizing the throughput gain amounts to minimizing the intra- and inter-iteration waiting times. We then focus on the OMP decoding of quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes. We propose a partly parallel OMP decoder architecture and implement it using FPGA. For any QC LDPC code, our OMP decoder achieves the maximum throughput gain and HUE due to overlapping, hence has higher throughput and HUE than previously proposed OMP decoders while maintaining the same hardware requirements. We also show that the maximum throughput gain and HUE achieved by our OMP decoder are ultimately determined by the given code. Thus, we propose a coset-based construction method, which results in QC LDPC codes that allow our optimal OMP decoder to achieve higher throughput and HUE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","volume":"16","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9921495","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4479869/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Overlapped Message Passing Decoding of Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Overlapped Message Passing Decoding of Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi05-dai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211641S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4490005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4490005","articleId":"4479869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4479872,"authors":[{"name":"Jaron Achterberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Electromechanics and Power Electronics Group, Eindhovan University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jaron","lastName":"Achterberg","id":"37594673400"},{"name":"Elena A.

Previous work has either treated the binary precoder as an exclusive function of the channel characteristics, disregarding possible impact from the channel code, or, in performing the iterative analysis of this concatenated system, assumed an unbounded length. Our approach here is to extend the conventional infinite-length extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts to ISI systems of limited lengths, and to explicitly account for the effect of the channel nonergodicity. We found that short-length channel codes may exhibit distinctively different EXIT behaviors in different rate regions, and it is important to couple the precoder and the channel code. We show that infinite- and finite-length EXIT behaviors do not always agree, and hence the results obtained from the infinite-length analysis may not hold for practical short-length systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information analysis","Intersymbol interference","Iterative decoding","Magnetic recording","Magnetic analysis","Performance analysis","Concatenated codes","Error correction codes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Digital magnetic recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","intersymbol interference","iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-length extrinsic information transfer analysis","precoded ISI channels","intersymbol interference channels","partial response channels","magnetic recording systems","channel nonergodicity effect","short-length channel codes","EXIT behaviors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binary precoding","extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts","finite-length analysis","intersymbol interference (ISI)","partial response (PR) channels","turbo equalization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479880","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2008.917367","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4492849/04479880.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2008.917367","startPage":"648","endPage":"655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4492849","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Length Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) Analysis for Coded and Precoded ISI Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Length Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) Analysis for Coded and Precoded ISI Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479880/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 April 2008","volume":"44","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4479880/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2008","publicationDate":"May 2008","accessionNumber":"9921431","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Length Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) Analysis for Coded and Precoded ISI Channels","sourcePdf":"44tmag05-tan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061828S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4492849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4492849","articleId":"4479880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4479883,"authors":[{"name":"Bevin G.

The digital IF signal is noise shaped by a bandpass Sigma-Delta modulator with 1-bit IF output followed by a semidigital finite impulse response (FIR) filter. The current mode FIR filter combines scaled values of the local oscillator (LO) signal for performing reconstruction filtering and upconversion in a single module. The DIF2RF design modulates the digital IF signal with a digital LO signal. This topology eliminates the transconductance nonlinearity of conventional mixers and is inherently linear due to single-bit digital IF input. The presented architecture reduces clock jitter sensitivity of 1-bit DACs by masking IF clock transitions with LO signals. A prototype of the DIF2RF DAC is designed and fabricated in a five-layer metal 0.25-mum digital CMOS process. The architecture can be used in low-power software-defined digital-IF transmitters. The DIF2RF DAC consumes 49 mA from a 2.5-V supply, achieving -64.7-dBc third-order intermodulation at 1.03 GHz with a spurious-free dynamic range of 72 dB in a 15-MHz bandwidth.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Noise shaping","Digital modulation","Band pass filters","Clocks","Radio frequency","Delta-sigma modulation","Digital filters","Local oscillators","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","clocks","CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","FIR filters","jitter","mixers (circuits)","oscillators","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear Sigma-Delta digital IF","RF DAC transmitter","embedded upconverter mixer","bandpass Sigma-Delta modulator","semidigital finite impulse response filter","local oscillator signal","reconstruction filtering","upconversion","transconductance nonlinearity","clock jitter sensitivity","digital CMOS process","low-power software-defined digital-IF transmitters","bandwidth 15 MHz","voltage 2.5 V","size 0.25 mum","word length 1 bit","current 49 mA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clock jitter","CMOS integrated circuits (ICs)","digital-to-analog conversion","mixers","semidigital filtering","sigma\u2013delta modulation","transmitters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.920156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4516010/04479884.pdf","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4516010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.920156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Linear -\u2013- Digital IF to RF DAC Transmitter With Embedded Mixer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4479884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Linear <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Sigma$</tex></formula>\u2013<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Delta$</tex></formula> Digital IF to RF DAC Transmitter With Embedded Mixer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4479884/","volume":"56","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4479884/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9966504","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 May 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Linear <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Sigma$</tex></formula>\u2013<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\Delta$</tex></formula> Digital IF to RF DAC Transmitter With Embedded Mixer","sourcePdf":"56tmtt05-taleie-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.209942S","chronDate":"May  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4516010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4516010","articleId":"4479884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4479938,"authors":[{"name":"David W.
