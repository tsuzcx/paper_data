During the redundancy optimization of the power system network a binary encoded GA is used for a modified transmission network expansion problem, finding the optimal power line type with respect to the net present value (NPV) of minimal investment cost, operating costs and load flow constraints. Each individual is evaluated by a minimal state probability reliability estimation algorithm verifying a certain minimal reliability constraint. A developed improvement algorithm is used for individuals not satisfying a reliability constraint. A recently developed fast reliability calculation algorithm, computing energy not supplied, and the obtained NPV of the transmission network expansion problem are utilized as minimization function. The algorithm is applied to a real world sub transmission system in order to discuss strategies for future system expansions.","doi":"10.1109/PQ.2010.5550003","pdfPath":"/iel5/5543951/5549989/05550003.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"158","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 Electric Power Quality and Supply Reliability Conference","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 Electric Power Quality and Supply Reliability Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PQ.2010.5550003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5549989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic reliability optimization using hybrid genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic reliability optimization using hybrid genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11476193","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5550003/","conferenceDate":"16-18 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic reliability optimization using hybrid genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Kuressaare, Estonia","sourcePdf":"PQ2010E1GaunRechbergerRenner.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119328S","chronDate":"16-18 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5543951","isNumber":"5549989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5543951","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5549989","articleId":"5550003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5550031,"authors":[{"name":"Tony Shuo-Chun Kao","affiliation":["Gennum Corporation, Burlington, ONT, Canada","The Edward S.

The wide availability of high-performance computing resources has led to the development of sophisticated, higher-order, 3D models that are able to tackle real-world problems in practical time scales. However, these models are often truncated by computationally inefficient and/or poorly optimised outer absorbing boundary conditions (ABC). In this paper, we evaluate the practical performance of two of the most common techniques; (a) Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) and (b) wave matching boundaries (e.g., Higdon). We show that under certain 3D conditions, the computationally faster, wave matching boundaries can perform as well as the PML techniques and reduce the likelihood of unexpected internal reflections/errors occurring.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating the practical performance of absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) in higher-order, finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) GPR modelling","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the XIII Internarional Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar","doi":"10.1109/ICGPR.2010.5550176","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the XIII Internarional Conference on Ground Penetrating Radar","pdfPath":"/iel5/5540532/5550063/05550176.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGPR.2010.5550176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the practical performance of absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) in higher-order, finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) GPR modelling","conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550176/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11476497","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the practical performance of absorbing boundary conditions (ABC) in higher-order, finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) GPR modelling","confLoc":"Lecce, Italy","sourcePdf":"PR220CASSIDYNIGELver1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040845S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5540532","isNumber":"5550063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5540532","xplore-issue":"5550063","articleId":"5550176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5550213,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Then the backscattered signals corresponding to a certain imaging point are searched out through the time delay in each synthetic aperture position. Afterwards, the backscattered signals are multiplied in pair and the products are summed subsequently to form a result point. Experimental results present the superiority of the MBP algorithm over its original counterpart in artifacts suppression, as well as a slightly improvement in image resolution. In the end, theoretic analysis is performed to justify the validity of the MBP algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11476519","htmlLink":"/document/5550214/","conferenceDate":"21-25 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"A GPR imaging algorithm with artifacts suppression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPR imaging algorithm with artifacts suppression","confLoc":"Lecce, Italy","sourcePdf":"PR166ZHOULINver1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052551S","chronDate":"21-25 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5540532","isNumber":"5550063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5540532","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5550063","articleId":"5550214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5550222,"authors":[{"name":"Min Lu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Lu","id":"37290536100"},{"name":"Yutao Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yutao","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37406129400"},{"name":"Yi Su","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Su","id":"37276452000"},{"name":"Chunlin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Chunlin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37281275300"},{"name":"Jian Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406476300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4604-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4605-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5550222","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":634},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Ground penetrating radar","Radar antennas","Antenna arrays","Phased arrays","High-resolution imaging","Receiving antennas","Antenna theory","Image resolution","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","ground penetrating radar","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO ground penetrating radar plane antenna array","imaging method","antenna elements","phase center approximation theory","uniform square antenna array","synthetic aperture","2D image","3D image","wideband transmitting signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ground penetrating radar (GPR)","MIMO technique","phase center approximation (PCA)","imaging","compensation"]}],"abstract":"Antenna array is widely used in real time imaging of ground penetrating radar (GPR). With circumstance restricting, the number and interval of antenna elements are difficult to fit the need of high imaging resolution. In this paper, a kind of 4-transmitter and N-receiver MIMO GPR plane antenna array is proposed. Based on phase center approximation (PCA) theory, its equivalent antenna array is a uniform square antenna array with 4N T/R antenna elements, and the interval of equivalent elements is half of that of the real receiving elements. The equivalent uniform square antenna array has two synthetic apertures and can obtain the 2D information of target. So, the 2D image of the target can be derived by using narrowband transmitting signals and the 3D image can be derived by using wideband transmitting signals.

It is proved that the typical group code over the cyclic group of order eight achieves both the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and the expurgated error exponent. On the other hand, the typical binary-coset codes (under any labeling) is shown to be bounded away both from the Gilbert-Varshamov bound (at any rate) and the expurgated exponent (at low rates). The reason for this phenomenon is shown to rely on the symmetry structure of the 8-PSK constellation, which is known to match the cyclic group of order eight, but not the direct product of three copies of the binary group. The presented results indicate that designing group codes matching the symmetry of the channel guarantees better typical-code performance than designing codes whose algebraic structure does not match the channel. This contrasts the well-known fact that the average binary-coset code achieves both the capacity and the random-coding error exponent of any discrete memoryless channel.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memoryless systems","Linear code","Performance loss","Constraint theory","Parity check codes","Error analysis","Gaussian channels","Labeling","Turbo codes","Information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","binary codes","channel coding","group codes","phase shift keying","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group codes","binary-coset codes","nonbinary symmetric memoryless channels","PSK Gaussian channel","capacity-achieving code ensembles","algebraic structure","Gilbert-Varshamov bound","expurgated error exponent","symmetry structure","group codes matching","discrete memoryless channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coset codes","error exponent","expurgated exponent","Gilbert\u2013Varshamov bound","group codes","linear codes","minimum distance","random codes"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2054330","startPage":"4321","endPage":"4334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5550275/05550276.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2054330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group Codes Outperform Binary-Coset Codes on Nonbinary Symmetric Memoryless Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Group Codes Outperform Binary-Coset Codes on Nonbinary Symmetric Memoryless Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11473337","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","volume":"56","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550276/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group Codes Outperform Binary-Coset Codes on Nonbinary Symmetric Memoryless Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-como-2054330-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089822S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5550275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5550275","articleId":"5550276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5550277,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Warner Cuff","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Paul Warner","lastName":"Cuff","id":"37860470800"},{"name":"Haim H.

Our main result is a capacity theorem that gives a 3-D achievable rate region. Points in the region are rate triples, consisting of the classical communication rate, the quantum communication rate, and the entanglement consumption rate of a particular coding scheme. The crucial protocol in achieving the boundary points of the capacity region is a protocol that we name the classically enhanced father \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(</i>\nCEF) protocol. The CEF protocol is more general than other protocols in the family tree of quantum Shannon theoretic protocols, in the sense that several previously known quantum protocols are now child protocols of it. The CEF protocol also shows an improvement over a timesharing strategy for the case of a qubit dephasing channel-this result justifies the need for simultaneous coding of classical and quantum information over an EAQ channel. Our capacity theorem is of a multiletter nature (requiring a limit over many uses of the channel), but it reduces to a single-letter characterization for at least three channels: the completely depolarizing channel, the quantum erasure channel, and the qubit dephasing channel.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2053903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5550275/05550293.pdf","startPage":"4682","endPage":"4704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2053903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Entanglement-Assisted Communication of Classical and Quantum Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550293/","displayDocTitle":"Entanglement-Assisted Communication of Classical and Quantum Information","volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473339","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550293/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Entanglement-Assisted Communication of Classical and Quantum Information","sourcePdf":"tit-wilde-2053903-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162729S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5550275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5550275","articleId":"5550293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5550296,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed A.

The most critical information must be identified to achieve good efficiency/cost trade-offs when selective hardening is necessary. In processor-based systems, the most critical variables and registers must thus be identified for the target application program. An improved algorithm for critical register identification is described and compared to previous work. Fault injection results in a system based on Leon2 are also reported. They demonstrate the impact of micro-architectural characteristics on evaluating the real criticality of the register file. New refinements are suggested for further work based on data dependency analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2043540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear

Due to technology scaling, functional fault models traditionally applied in SRAMs' testing have become insufficient to correctly reproduce the effects caused by some defects generated during the manufacturing process. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to use Built-In Current Sensors (BICSs) in combination with an optimized March algorithm to detect static faults associated to resistive-open defects. Experimental results obtained throughout electrical simulations validate the proposed technique demonstrating its viability and effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/LATW.2010.5550342","publicationTitle":"2010 11th Latin American Test Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 11th Latin American Test Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/5542405/5550333/05550342.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LATW.2010.5550342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BICS-based March test for resistive-open defect detection in SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"BICS-based March test for resistive-open defect detection in SRAMs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550342/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11541115","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BICS-based March test for resistive-open defect detection in SRAMs","confLoc":"Punta del Este, Uruguay","sourcePdf":"latwchipanaarticle.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043289S","chronDate":"28-31 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5542405","isNumber":"5550333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5542405","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5550333","articleId":"5550342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5550362,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Artola","affiliation":["CNES, Toulouse, France","ONERA, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Artola","id":"37540614800"},{"name":"G.

Power is saved by reducing the wordlength of computation in the filters and FFT functions of the baseband processor and simultaneously reducing the supply voltage. Power modulation is done on the basis of closed-loop feedback control using a control law that continuously \"tunes\" the baseband processor for minimum power using the wireless channel quality, the image/video quality and the current quality of baseband signal processing as input parameters.

While several examples are known of constant channels that achieve more than 1 degree-of-freedom, these special cases only span a subset of measure zero. In other words, for almost all channel coefficient values, it is not known if more than 1 degree-of-freedom is achievable. In this paper, we settle the H\u00f8st-Madsen-Nosratinia conjecture in the negative. We show that at least 1.2 degrees-of-freedom are achievable for all values of complex channel coefficients except for a subset of measure zero. For the class of linear beamforming and interference alignment schemes considered in this paper, it is also shown that 1.2 is the maximum number of degrees-of-freedom achievable on the complex Gaussian 3 user interference channel with constant channel coefficients, for almost all values of channel coefficients. To establish the achievability of 1.2 degrees-of-freedom we use the novel idea of asymmetric complex signaling - i.e., the inputs are chosen to be complex but not circularly symmetric. It is shown that unlike Gaussian point-to-point, multiple-access and broadcast channels where circularly symmetric complex Gaussian inputs are optimal, for interference channels optimal inputs are in general asymmetric. With asymmetric complex signaling, we also show that the 2 user complex Gaussian X channel with constant channel coefficients achieves the outer bound of 4/3 degrees-of-freedom, i.e., the assumption of time-variations/frequency-selectivity used in prior work to establish the same result, is not needed.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2053895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5550275/05550404.pdf","startPage":"4552","endPage":"4565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2053895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment With Asymmetric Complex Signaling\u2014Settling the H\u00f8st-Madsen\u2013Nosratinia Conjecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550404","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment With Asymmetric Complex Signaling\u2014Settling the H\u00f8st-Madsen\u2013Nosratinia Conjecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550404/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11473336","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550404/","volume":"56","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment With Asymmetric Complex Signaling\u2014Settling the H\u00f8st-Madsen\u2013Nosratinia Conjecture","sourcePdf":"tit-wang-2053895-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126511S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5550275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"5550275","articleId":"5550404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5550405,"authors":[{"name":"Herman T. van Dam","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Herman T.","lastName":"van Dam","id":"37321187600"},{"name":"Stefan Seifert","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands","Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut (KVI), Groningen, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Seifert","id":"37410406500"},{"name":"Ruud Vinke","affiliation":["Kernfysisch Versneller Institute, Groningen, Netherlands","University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ruud","lastName":"Vinke","id":"37398255100"},{"name":"Peter Dendooven","affiliation":["Kernfysisch Versneller Institute, Groningen, Netherlands","University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Dendooven","id":"37398254000"},{"name":"Herbert L\u00f6hner","affiliation":["Kernfysisch Versneller Institute, Groningen, Netherlands","University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Herbert","lastName":"L\u00f6hner","id":"37332986800"},{"name":"Freek J.

Existing models of the SiPM response do not account for all of these effects, and therefore, these models are not sufficiently accurate for many applications. In this work, a comprehensive model of the SiPM response is developed that is generally applicable to exponentially decaying light pulses and that can be simplified in the case of very short (e.g., laser) light pulses. The model accounts for the total number and the temporal distribution of the incident photons as well as for the relevant SiPM parameters, viz. the recovery time, afterpulsing, crosstalk, and their cross correlations.

The results of these simulations show that event-to-event variation may have a significant impact when predicting the single-event rate in advanced spacecraft electronics.

Technology scaling has resulted in a greater sensitivity to single event effects (SEEs) and more in particular to SET propagation, since transients may be generated and propagated through the circuit logic, leading to behavioral errors of the affected circuit. When circuits are implemented on Flash-based FPGAs, SETs generated in the combinational logic resources are the main source of critical behavior. In this paper, we developed a technique based on electrical pulse injection for the analysis of SETs propagation within logic resources of Flash-based FPGAs. We outline logic schematic that allows the injection of different SET pulses. We performed several experimental analyses. We characterized the basic logic gates used by circuits implemented on Flash-based FPGAs evaluating the effect on logic-chains of real lengths. Additionally, we performed an effective analysis evaluating the SET propagation through microprocessor logic paths. Results demonstrated the possibility of mitigating SET-broadening effects by acting on physical place and route constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2043686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5550295/05550412.pdf","startPage":"1820","endPage":"1826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2043686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of SET Propagation in Flash-Based FPGAs by Means of Electrical Pulse Injection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of SET Propagation in Flash-Based FPGAs by Means of Electrical Pulse Injection","volume":"57","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11473418","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550412/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550412/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of SET Propagation in Flash-Based FPGAs by Means of Electrical Pulse Injection","sourcePdf":"tns-lsterpone-2043686-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117516S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5550295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5550295","articleId":"5550412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5550413,"authors":[{"name":"Slawosz Uznanski","affiliation":["Central CAD and Design Solutions, STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Slawosz","lastName":"Uznanski","id":"37540583700"},{"name":"Gilles Gasiot","affiliation":["Central CAD and Design Solutions, STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Gasiot","id":"37267707600"},{"name":"Philippe Roche","affiliation":["Central CAD and Design Solutions, STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Roche","id":"37281997800"},{"name":"Clement Tavernier","affiliation":["Central CAD and Design Solutions, STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Clement","lastName":"Tavernier","id":"37407732700"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Autran","affiliation":["Institute of Materials, Microelectronics and Nanosciences of Provence (IM2NP, UMR CNRS), Marseilles, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Autran","id":"37268834800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"5550413","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1143},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550413","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Single event upset","Semiconductor device modeling","Flip-flops","Circuit simulation","Error correction codes","Equations","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Random access memory","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","flip-flops","ion beam effects","Monte Carlo methods","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple cell upset modeling","single event upset modeling","CMOS SRAM","Monte-Carlo simulation code","heavy ion cross-section","diffusion-collection equations","account recombination processes","circuit architectures","radiation-hardened-by-design Flip-Flop","heavy ion radiation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DICE","MCU","Monte-Carlo simulation","Radiation-Hardened-By-Design","SEU","SEU cross-section","SPICE"]}],"abstract":"A proprietary Monte-Carlo simulation code dedicated to heavy ion cross-section prediction has been developed.

While both entropies are equal to the von Neumann entropy in certain special cases (e.g., asymptotically, for many independent repetitions of the given data), their values can differ arbitrarily in the general case. In this paper, a recently discovered duality relation between (nonsmooth) min- and max-entropies is extended to the smooth case.

As transistor sizes shrink, multiple cells upsets (MCUs) are becoming an increasingly important factor in the reliability of memories exposed to radiation effects. To address this issue, built-in current sensors (BICS) or Parity codes have recently been applied in conjunction with single error correction/double error detection (SEC-DED) codes to protect memories from MCUs. In this paper, this approach is taken one step further, proposing specific codes optimized to provide protection against errors in adjacent bits in memories. By exploiting the locality of errors within an MCU and the error detection and location capabilities of parity codes, the proposed codes result in both a better protection level and a reduced cost. This technique improves memory reliability by 675X compared to Hamming Codes (HC) and 38X the mean time to failure (MTTF) compared to Reed Muller Codes (RMC) for clustered MCUs.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2043265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2043265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5550295/05550428.pdf","startPage":"2106","endPage":"2111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550428/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Matrix-Based Codes for Adjacent Error Correction","volume":"57","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11473441","htmlLink":"/document/5550428/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix-Based Codes for Adjacent Error Correction","sourcePdf":"tns-maestro-2043265-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079948S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5550295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5550295","articleId":"5550428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5550429,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Fu Liu","affiliation":["Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Shih-Fu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406046200"},{"name":"Pedro Reviriego","affiliation":["Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Reviriego","id":"37393409900"},{"name":"Juan Antonio Maestro","affiliation":["Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Antonio","lastName":"Maestro","id":"37410622900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"5550429","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Implementations of Hamming Codes to Protect FIR Filters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5550295/05550429.pdf","startPage":"2112","endPage":"2118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2051162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550295","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2051162","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Finite impulse response filter","Single event upset","Redundancy","Digital filters","IIR filters","Silicon","Integrated circuit technology","Space missions","Digital circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","Hamming codes","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hamming codes","FIR filter protection","digital circuits","system failure probability","triple modular redundancy","circuit functionality","finite impulse response filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital filters","hamming codes","reliability","Single Event Upset (SEU)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550429","abstract":"Soft errors, especially those produced in harsh environments (as for example radiation), are a major concern for digital circuits.

This kind of errors is increasingly important as technology scales, becoming a prominent effect, and therefore greatly affecting the reliability of memories. Ideally, the interleaving distance (ID) should be chosen as the maximum expected MCU size. In this way, all errors in an MCU would occur in different logical words, thus being correctable by the SEC codes. However, the use of large interleaving distances usually results in an area increase and a more complex design of memories. In this paper, the selection of the optimal interleaving distance is explored, keeping the area overhead and complexity as low as possible, without compromising memory reliability.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2042818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5550295/05550430.pdf","startPage":"2124","endPage":"2128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2042818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protection of Memories Suffering MCUs Through the Selection of the Optimal Interleaving Distance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550430/","displayDocTitle":"Protection of Memories Suffering MCUs Through the Selection of the Optimal Interleaving Distance","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473405","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550430/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protection of Memories Suffering MCUs Through the Selection of the Optimal Interleaving Distance","sourcePdf":"tns-jmaestro-2042818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068841S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5550295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5550295","articleId":"5550430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5550444,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Lisiansky","affiliation":["Tower Semiconductor Ltd, Migdal HaEmek, Israel"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lisiansky","id":"37317011200"},{"name":"Gil Cassuto","affiliation":["Tower Semiconductor Limited, Migdal HaEmek, Israel","Tower Semiconductor Ltd, Migdal HaEmek, Israel"],"firstName":"Gil","lastName":"Cassuto","id":"37540519200"},{"name":"Yakov Roizin","affiliation":["Tower Semiconductor Limited, Migdal HaEmek, Israel","Tower Semiconductor Ltd, Migdal HaEmek, Israel"],"firstName":"Yakov","lastName":"Roizin","id":"38476880500"},{"name":"Domenico Corso","affiliation":["CNR-IMM, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Corso","id":"37269223900"},{"name":"Sebania Libertino","affiliation":["CNR-IMM, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Sebania","lastName":"Libertino","id":"37296218500"},{"name":"Antonio Marino","affiliation":["CNR-IMM, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Marino","id":"37528218900"},{"name":"Salvatore A.

The classical non-ionizing energy loss calculation, performed under binary cascade approximation, lacks accuracy at low incident energy for some light particles such as electrons. The amount of displacement damage predicted by molecular dynamics simulations where many-body interactions are naturally included can be significantly different from the classical binary collision calculation. The creation of damage predicted by molecular dynamics technique, within the low energy deposition regime, can be quite different from what can be classically simulated. For instance, earlier studies demonstrated that, under suitable conditions, low energy transfer below the atomic displacement threshold can increase damage production. In the case of silicon material, molecular dynamics simulation results have been incorporated within the definition of a new energy partition function. In comparison with the classical Kinchin Pease approach, our improved model more accurately estimates the number of displacements generated by a primary knock-on atom. This new energy partition function is used to calculate corrected non- ionizing energy loss.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u201cEffective NIEL\u201d in Silicon: Calculation Using Molecular Dynamics Simulation Results","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2049581","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5550295/05550450.pdf","startPage":"1915","endPage":"1923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2049581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550450/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"\u201cEffective NIEL\u201d in Silicon: Calculation Using Molecular Dynamics Simulation Results","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5550450/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473431","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u201cEffective NIEL\u201d in Silicon: Calculation Using Molecular Dynamics Simulation Results","sourcePdf":"tns-cinguimbert-2049581-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114187S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5550295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5550295","articleId":"5550450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5550477,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Jean Boutros","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, Qatar, Doha, Qatar","Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"bio":{"p":["Joseph Jean Boutros (M'94\u2013SM'09) received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1992 and the Ph.D. degree in 1996, both from Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (ENST, Telecom ParisTech), Paris, France.","From 1996 to 2006, he was with the Communications and Electronics Department, ENST, as an Associate Professor.

Fortunately, the survival rate for early diagnosed patients is relatively high. Therefore, \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i>\n imaging plays an important role for the detection and treatment of the disease. Accurate prostate cancer localization with noninvasive imaging can be used to guide biopsy, radiotheraphy, and surgery as well as to monitor disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with an endorectal coil provides higher prostate cancer localization accuracy, when compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, in general, a single type of MRI is not sufficient for reliable tumor localization. As an alternative, multispectral MRI, i.e., the use of multiple MRI-derived datasets, has emerged as a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the localization of prostate cancer; however almost all studies are with human readers. There is a significant inter and intraobserver variability for human readers, and it is substantially difficult for humans to analyze the large dataset of multispectral MRI. To solve these problems, this study presents an automated localization method using cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs) and shows that this method results in improved localization accuracy than classical SVM. Additionally, we develop a new segmentation method by combining conditional random fields (CRF) with a cost-sensitive framework and show that our method further improves cost-sensitive SVM results by incorporating spatial information. We test SVM, cost-sensitive SVM, and the proposed cost-sensitive CRF on multispectral MRI datasets acquired from 21 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients. Our results show that multispectral MRI helps to increase the accuracy of prostate cancer localization when compared to single MR images; and that using advanced methods such as cost-sensitive SVM as well as the proposed cost-sensitive CRF can boost the performance significantly when compared to SVM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prostate Cancer Localization With Multispectral MRI Using Cost-Sensitive Support Vector Machines and Conditional Random Fields","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2048612","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5550283/05550479.pdf","startPage":"2444","endPage":"2455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2048612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Prostate Cancer Localization With Multispectral MRI Using Cost-Sensitive Support Vector Machines and Conditional Random Fields","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5550479/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11510736","pubMedId":"20716496","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prostate Cancer Localization With Multispectral MRI Using Cost-Sensitive Support Vector Machines and Conditional Random Fields","sourcePdf":"19tip09-yartan-2048612-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114757S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5550283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5550283","articleId":"5550479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5550480,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro Ribeiro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Alejandro Ribeiro (M'07) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Universidad de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay, Montevideo, in 1998, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.","He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he started in 2008.

Application scenarios include data centers, peer-to-peer storage systems, and storage in wireless networks. Storing data using an erasure code, in fragments spread across nodes, requires less redundancy than simple replication for the same level of reliability. However, since fragments must be periodically replaced as nodes fail, a key question is how to generate encoded fragments in a distributed way while transferring as little data as possible across the network. For an erasure coded system, a common practice to repair from a single node failure is for a new node to reconstruct the whole encoded data object to generate just one encoded block. We show that this procedure is sub-optimal. We introduce the notion of regenerating codes, which allow a new node to communicate \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">functions</i>\n of the stored data from the surviving nodes. We show that regenerating codes can significantly reduce the repair bandwidth. Further, we show that there is a fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth which we theoretically characterize using flow arguments on an appropriately constructed graph. By invoking constructive results in network coding, we introduce regenerating codes that can achieve any point in this optimal tradeoff.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2054295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5550275/05550492.pdf","startPage":"4539","endPage":"4551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2054295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Coding for Distributed Storage Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Network Coding for Distributed Storage Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550492/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11473344","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550492/","volume":"56","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Coding for Distributed Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"tit-dimakis-2054295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105088S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5550275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"1091","xplore-issue":"5550275","articleId":"5550492","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":5550495,"authors":[{"name":"Mark A.

In this paper we demonstrate that the restricted isometry property (RIP) can be used for a very straightforward analysis of OMP. Our main conclusion is that the RIP of order K+1 (with isometry constant \u03b4 <; [ 1/( 3\u221aK)]) is sufficient for OMP to exactly recover any K-sparse signal. The analysis relies on simple and intuitive observations about OMP and matrices which satisfy the RIP. For restricted classes of K-sparse signals (those that are highly compressible), a relaxed bound on the isometry constant is also established. A deeper understanding of OMP may benefit the analysis of greedy algorithms in general. To demonstrate this, we also briefly revisit the analysis of the regularized OMP (ROMP) algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5550275/05550495.pdf","startPage":"4395","endPage":"4401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2054653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2054653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Using the Restricted Isometry Property","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Greedy algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Pursuit algorithms","Dictionaries","Sparse matrices","Software algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Software packages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","greedy algorithms","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal matching pursuit","restricted isometry property","canonical greedy algorithm","sparse approximation","K-sparse signal","relaxed bound","isometry constant","regularized OMP algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","greedy algorithms","orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)","redundant dictionaries","restricted isometry property (RIP)","sparse approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Using the Restricted Isometry Property","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5550495/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473346","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Using the Restricted Isometry Property","sourcePdf":"tit-davenport-2054653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068198S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5550275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"300","xplore-issue":"5550275","articleId":"5550495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5550496,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Cescato","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, Zurich, Switzerland","Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Davide Cescato (S'05\u2013M'08) was born in Mendrisio, Switzerland, in 1978.

A simple search over the target rank then provides the minimum rank solution satisfying a prescribed data approximation bound. We propose an atomic decomposition providing an analogy between parsimonious representations of a sparse vector and a low-rank matrix and extending efficient greedy algorithms from the vector to the matrix case. In particular, we propose an efficient and guaranteed algorithm named atomic decomposition for minimum rank approximation (ADMiRA) that extends Needell and Tropp's compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP) algorithm from the sparse vector to the low-rank matrix case. The performance guarantee is given in terms of the rank-restricted isometry property (R-RIP) and bounds both the number of iterations and the error in the approximate solution for the general case of noisy measurements and approximately low-rank solution. With a sparse measurement operator as in the matrix completion problem, the computation in ADMiRA is linear in the number of measurements. Numerical experiments for the matrix completion problem show that, although the R-RIP is not satisfied in this case, ADMiRA is a competitive algorithm for matrix completion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5550275/05550497.pdf","startPage":"4402","endPage":"4416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2054251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2054251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ADMiRA: Atomic Decomposition for Minimum Rank Approximation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Sparse matrices","Compressed sensing","Inverse problems","Matching pursuit algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Pursuit algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Vectors","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","data compression","greedy algorithms","inverse problems","matrix decomposition","sampling methods","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ADMiRA","compressed sensing","low-rank matrix","inverse problem","minimum rank solution","data approximation bound","parsimonious representations","sparse vector","greedy algorithms","atomic decomposition for minimum rank approximation","compressive sampling matching pursuit algorithm","CoSaMP algorithm","rank-restricted isometry property","R-RIP","noisy measurements","sparse measurement operator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","matrix completion","performance guarantee","rank minimization","singular value decomposition (SVD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"ADMiRA: Atomic Decomposition for Minimum Rank Approximation","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5550497/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473348","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ADMiRA: Atomic Decomposition for Minimum Rank Approximation","sourcePdf":"tit-bresler-2054251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090158S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5550275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"5550275","articleId":"5550497","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5550500,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A natural goal is to apply this approach to the Gaussian interference channel with an arbitrary number of users. We make progress towards this goal by finding the capacity region of the many-to-one and one-to-many Gaussian interference channels to within a constant number of bits. The result makes use of a deterministic model to provide insight into the Gaussian channel. The deterministic model makes explicit the dimension of signal level. A central theme emerges: the use of lattice codes for alignment of interfering signals on the signal level.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2054590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5550275/05550501.pdf","startPage":"4566","endPage":"4592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2054590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Approximate Capacity of the Many-to-One and One-to-Many Gaussian Interference Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550501/","displayDocTitle":"The Approximate Capacity of the Many-to-One and One-to-Many Gaussian Interference Channels","volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473327","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Approximate Capacity of the Many-to-One and One-to-Many Gaussian Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-bresler-2054590-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079178S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","isNumber":"5550275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"183","articleId":"5550501","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5550502,"authors":[{"name":"Yanling Chen","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IESE, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Yanling Chen received the B.S. degree in 2001 and the M.S. degree in 2004, both in applied mathematics, from Nankai University, Tianjin, China, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from the University of Duisburg- Essen, Germany, in 2007.","Currently, she is an ERCIM Postdoctorate fellow, visiting NTNU/Q2S (Centre for Quantifiable Quality of Service in Communication Systems, Centre of Excellence at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology) in Norway and Fraunhofer IESE (Institute for Experimental Software Engineering) in Germany.

The ion mass and energy have a significant impact on the radial ionization profile of the ion deposited charge. For example, for an identical LET, the higher the ion energy per nucleon, the wider the radial ionization track. For a 70-nm SOI technology, the track radius of high energy ions (> 10 MeV/a) is larger than the transistor sensitive volume; part of the ion charge recombines in the highly doped source or drain regions and does not participate to the transistor electric response. At lower energy (<; 10 MeV/a), as often used for ground testing, the track radius is smaller than the transistor sensitive volume, and the entire charge is used for the transistor response. The collected charge is then higher, corresponding to a worst-case response of the transistor. Implications for the hardness assurance of highly-scaled generations are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2048926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5550295/05550508.pdf","startPage":"1892","endPage":"1899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2048926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of the Ion Mass and Energy on the Response of 70-nm SOI Transistors to the Ion Deposited Charge by Direct Ionization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550508/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of the Ion Mass and Energy on the Response of 70-nm SOI Transistors to the Ion Deposited Charge by Direct Ionization","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473411","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550508/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of the Ion Mass and Energy on the Response of 70-nm SOI Transistors to the Ion Deposited Charge by Direct Ionization","sourcePdf":"tns-mraine-2048926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085963S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5550295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5550295","articleId":"5550508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5550510,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The Alice-Bob channel is a fixed-SNR AWGN channel, while the Alice-Eve channel is a fast Rayleigh fading channel, with the channel states only known to Eve. Alice knows the statistics of Alice-Eve channel, but not the exact realizations. We investigate the achievable secrecy rates for this channel model with Gaussian signaling and discrete signaling. For Gaussian signaling, several transmission strategies according to the main channel's relative channel gain are proposed and evaluated. For discrete signaling, achievable secrecy rates with Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) are evaluated. When Bob's channel is much better than Eve's channel, simple Gaussian signaling can perform close to the upper bound, and is better than the rate achieved with M-QAM. When Bob's channel gain is on average worse than the eavesdropper's average channel gain, positive secrecy rate can still be achieved for Gaussian signaling with artificial noise injection and a burst signaling strategy. Moreover, M-QAM can outperform Gaussian signaling. The key factor that enables secret communication in this case is that both M-QAM and artificial noise limit the leakage of information when Eve's channel is unusually good.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5578601/05550916.pdf","startPage":"2792","endPage":"2799","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.080210.090948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.080210.090948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578601","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Secret Communication for Fast Rayleigh Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Wireless communication","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Channel models","Signal to noise ratio","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secret communication","fast Rayleigh fading channels","passive eavesdropper","Alice-Bob channel","AWGN channel","Alice-Eve channel","Gaussian signaling","discrete signaling","quadrature amplitude modulation","artificial noise injection","burst signaling strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security","wireless communications","secrecy rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Secret Communication for Fast Rayleigh Fading Channels","volume":"9","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5550916/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527935","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Secret Communication for Fast Rayleigh Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"2792-tw1009-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067703S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5578601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5578601","articleId":"5550916","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5550917,"authors":[{"name":"Tadeusz Wysocki","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5595095/5550917/5550917-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tadeusz Wysocki (S'09) is currently completing a PhD at the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney.

In this paper we analyze the recently proposed mean-variance based QoS and resource management methods, and introduce the concept of mean-variance evaluation of QoS and resource management techniques. Inspired by financial Portfolio Selection theory, mean-variance based resource management techniques for CR networks are statistical approaches and do not require instantaneous knowledge of channel state and Primary User (PU) activity, and enable the option to tradeoff between risk (QoS variance) and reward (QoS mean). Using throughput as a measure of QoS, we present a derivation of the theoretical throughput mean-variance characteristics of a CR-OFDM system employing a mean-variance based QoS management strategy. We conduct an analysis of existing Portfolio Selection based strategies in the mean-variance domain and compare them to the theoretical performance. Finally, we present a further enhancement of the approach by explicitly considering constraints on individual channel power allocation in the mean-variance optimization problem. Simulation results illustrate the effect of our enhancements in improving the risk-reward profile of the mean-variance based QoS management strategy, by moving it closer to the theoretical characteristic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550917/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","volume":"9","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"11579760","publicationDate":"October 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5550917/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mean-Variance Based QoS Management in Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mean-Variance Based QoS Management in Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"3281-tw1010-wysocki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138674S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5550917","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5550918,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5578601/5550918/5550918-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Han received his B.Eng degree in electrical and electronic engineering in 2005 from School of Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China.

We focus on the so-called transparent amplify-and-forward (T-AaF) for MIMO relay channels, in which the relay requires neither channel state information (CSI) nor synchronization of symbols or carrier. Specifically, we propose and analyze new selection schemes, where the relay, based on the received signal energies, selects the \"best\" received signal on the S \u2192 R hop and forwards it to the destination terminal with either repetitive or selective transmission. Through the derivation of pairwise error probability (PEP) expressions and asymptotic order of diversity (AOD) analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed selection schemes preserve full diversity order, while maintaining low complexity implementation, which makes them attractive from a practical point of view. Furthermore, we show that adopting selective transmission on the R \u2192 D hop provides better performance, better throughput, and significantly better energy efficiency than repetitive transmission. A Monte Carlo simulation study is also presented to corroborate the analytical results and to provide detailed performance comparisons between the two schemes under consideration.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transparent Amplify-and-Forward Relaying in MIMO Relay Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.080210.091343","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05550919.pdf","startPage":"3144","endPage":"3154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.080210.091343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5550919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5550919/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","displayDocTitle":"Transparent Amplify-and-Forward Relaying in MIMO Relay Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5550919/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574436","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transparent Amplify-and-Forward Relaying in MIMO Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"3144-tw1010-muhaidat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126704S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5550919","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5550995,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Kozyrakis","affiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Christos Kozyrakis is an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and the Willard R. and Inez Kerr Bell faculty scholar at Stanford University.

These types of remote laboratories are called WebLabs, and can be deployed over different networks such as the public internet, campuswide networks, or high-speed private networks. Although most published works on WebLabs focus on their functional and operational aspects, nonfunctional requirements related to security, quality of service, and federated operation of WebLabs have received little attention.

Interconnect fabrics for these multicore SoCs play a crucial role in achieving the target performance. The Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm has been proposed as a promising solution for designing the interconnect fabric of multicore SoCs. But the performance requirements of NoC infrastructures in future technology nodes cannot be met by relying only on material innovation with traditional scaling. The continuing demand for low-power and high-speed interconnects with technology scaling necessitates looking beyond the conventional planar metal/dielectric-based interconnect infrastructures. Among different possible alternatives, the on-chip wireless communication network is envisioned as a revolutionary methodology, capable of bringing significant performance gains for multicore SoCs. Wireless NoCs (WiNoCs) can be designed by using miniaturized on-chip antennas as an enabling technology. In this paper, we present design methodologies and technology requirements for scalable WiNoC architectures and evaluate their performance. It is demonstrated that WiNoCs outperform their wired counterparts in terms of network throughput and latency, and that energy dissipation improves by orders of magnitude. The performance of the proposed WiNoC is evaluated in presence of various traffic patterns and also compared with other emerging alternative NoCs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","volume":"60","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12216100","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5551123/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Hybrid Wireless Network-on-Chip Architectures for Multicore Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Hybrid Wireless Network-on-Chip Architectures for Multicore Systems","sourcePdf":"ttc2011101485.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120845S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6008534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"171","xplore-issue":"6008534","articleId":"5551123","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5551125,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Tian","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Multi-spectral Information Processing Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Tian","id":"37537341100"},{"name":"Lin Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Multi-spectral Information Processing Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37535429600"},{"name":"Yi-Hua Tan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Multi-spectral Information Processing Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yi-Hua","lastName":"Tan","id":"37289350300"},{"name":"Jin-Wen Tian","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Multi-spectral Information Processing Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jin-Wen","lastName":"Tian","id":"37277484300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"5551125","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1202},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Multi-Input/Multi-Output VLSI Architecture for Two-Dimensional Lifting-Based Discrete Wavelet Transform","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5929503/05551125.pdf","startPage":"1207","endPage":"1211","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5929503","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.178","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Discrete wavelet transforms","Filtering","Registers","Hardware","Delay","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","high-speed integrated circuits","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiinput-multioutput VLSI architecture","2D lifting-based discrete wavelet transform","high-speed architecture","throughput rate","hardware cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transform","very-large-scale integration (VLSI)","high-speed","lifting scheme","multi-input/multi-output."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551125","abstract":"This brief paper proposes an efficient multi-input/multi-output VLSI architecture (MIMOA) for two-dimensional lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

Users may simply leave when the database service delay is excessive. Also, temporally inconsistent data may give an outdated view of the real-world status. However, supporting the desired timeliness and freshness is challenging due to dynamic workloads. To address the problem, we present new approaches for 1) database backlog estimation, 2) fine-grained closed-loop admission control based on the backlog model, and 3) incoming load smoothing. Our backlog estimation and control-theoretic approaches aim to support the desired service delay bound without degrading the data freshness, critical for real-time data services. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate two feedback controllers based on linear control theory and fuzzy logic control theory, to meet the desired service delay. Workload smoothing, under overload, helps the database admit and process more transactions in a timely fashion by probabilistically reducing the burstiness of incoming data service requests. In terms of the data service delay and throughput, our closed-loop admission control and probabilistic load smoothing schemes considerably outperform several baselines in the experiments undertaken in a stock trading database testbed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551137/","volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5551137/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11847719","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Estimating and Enhancing Real-Time Data Service Delays: Control-Theoretic Approaches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating and Enhancing Real-Time Data Service Delays: Control-Theoretic Approaches","sourcePdf":"ttk2011040554.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084792S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5715919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5715919","articleId":"5551137","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5551139,"authors":[{"name":"Won-Yeol Lee","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5671529/5551139/5551139-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Won-Yeol Lee received the BS and MS degrees from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2009 under the guidance of Professor Ian F.

However, they face to a unique challenge based on the fluctuating nature of heterogeneous spectrum bands as well as the diverse service requirements of various applications. In this paper, a spectrum decision framework is proposed to determine a set of spectrum bands by considering the application requirements as well as the dynamic nature of spectrum bands. To this end, first, each spectrum is characterized by jointly considering primary user activity and spectrum sensing operations. Based on this, a minimum variance-based spectrum decision is proposed for real-time applications, which minimizes the capacity variance of the decided spectrum bands subject to the capacity constraints. For best-effort applications, a maximum capacity-based spectrum decision is proposed where spectrum bands are decided to maximize the total network capacity. Moreover, a dynamic resource management scheme is developed to coordinate the spectrum decision adaptively dependent on the time-varying cognitive radio network capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed methods provide efficient bandwidth utilization while satisfying service requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spectrum Decision Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.147","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5671529/05551139.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5671529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Spectrum Decision Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5551139/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11698252","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spectrum Decision Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2011020161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146735S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5671529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5671529","articleId":"5551139","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5551141,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Bouabdallah","affiliation":["INRIA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Nizar","lastName":"Bouabdallah","id":"37277754300"},{"name":"Brent Ishibashi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Ishibashi","id":"37426010400"},{"name":"Raouf Boutaba","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Raouf","lastName":"Boutaba","id":"37275592200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"5551141","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1742},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chromium","Interference","Home automation","Quality of service","Wireless networks","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","integer programming","linear programming","quality of service","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio based wireless mesh networks","QoS","integer linear programming","virtual wireless networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","wireless mesh networks","spectrum sharing","performance evaluation."]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio presents a new approach to wireless spectrum utilization and management. In this work, the potential performance improvement gained by applying cognitive radio to wireless mesh networks is investigated. Specifically, the potential benefits in terms of QoS provided to users and the efficiency of resource utilization are quantified in a system consisting of a collection of one or more service provider wireless networks. To achieve this, we formulate the problem mathematically using integer linear programming. It is shown that the cognitive radio abilities provide an advantage over the classical network, either by improving QoS through increasing the probability of accepting connection requests, or by reducing the resources needed to fulfill the QoS requirements of users. This advantage is gained without impacting the service of primary clients. More importantly, we show that virtual wireless networks can be created, utilizing only the residual wasted bandwidth of the primary service providers. These virtual networks are able to support large volumes of users, while still ensuring that QoS reliability requirements, such as acceptance probability guarantees, are achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.149","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5640589/05551141.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5640589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.149","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"122","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Cognitive Radio-Based Wireless Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Cognitive Radio-Based Wireless Mesh Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551141/","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5551141/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11654741","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Cognitive Radio-Based Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2011010122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077511S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","isNumber":"5640589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"15","articleId":"5551141","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5551147,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we present a way to approach this problem by integrating rich descriptors into the variational optical flow setting. This way we can estimate a dense optical flow field with almost the same high accuracy as known from variational optical flow, while reaching out to new domains of motion analysis where the requirement of dense sampling in time is no longer satisfied.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5692151/05551149.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large Displacement Optical Flow: Descriptor Matching in Variational Motion Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Large Displacement Optical Flow: Descriptor Matching in Variational Motion Estimation","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5551149/","accessionNumber":"11759965","pubMedId":"20714020","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large Displacement Optical Flow: Descriptor Matching in Variational Motion Estimation","sourcePdf":"ttp2011030500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070946S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5692151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"854","xplore-issue":"5692151","articleId":"5551149","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5551150,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Gilbert","affiliation":["Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5735600/5551150/5551150-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrew Gilbert received the BEng (Hons) degree in electronic engineering from the University of Surrey, United Kingdom, in 2005, and the PhD degree from the Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing at the University of Surrey in 2009.

Much of the progress has been through incorporating ideas from single-frame object recognition and adapting them for temporal-based action recognition. Inspired by the success of interest points in the 2D spatial domain, their 3D (space-time) counterparts typically form the basic components used to describe actions, and in action recognition the features used are often engineered to fire sparsely. This is to ensure that the problem is tractable; however, this can sacrifice recognition accuracy as it cannot be assumed that the optimum features in terms of class discrimination are obtained from this approach. In contrast, we propose to initially use an overcomplete set of simple 2D corners in both space and time. These are grouped spatially and temporally using a hierarchical process, with an increasing search area. At each stage of the hierarchy, the most distinctive and descriptive features are learned efficiently through data mining. This allows large amounts of data to be searched for frequently reoccurring patterns of features. At each level of the hierarchy, the mined compound features become more complex, discriminative, and sparse. This results in fast, accurate recognition with real-time performance on high-resolution video. As the compound features are constructed and selected based upon their ability to discriminate, their speed and accuracy increase at each level of the hierarchy. The approach is tested on four state-of-the-art data sets, the popular KTH data set to provide a comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, the Multi-KTH data set to illustrate performance at simultaneous multiaction classification, despite no explicit localization information provided during training. Finally, the recent Hollywood and Hollywood2 data sets provide challenging complex actions taken from commercial movie sequences. For all four data sets, the proposed hierarchical approach outperforms all other methods reported thus far in the literature and can achieve real-time operation.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5735600/05551150.pdf","startPage":"883","endPage":"897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Action Recognition Using Mined Hierarchical Compound Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551150/","displayDocTitle":"Action Recognition Using Mined Hierarchical Compound Features","volume":"33","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11874877","pubMedId":"20714014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551150/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Action Recognition Using Mined Hierarchical Compound Features","sourcePdf":"ttp2011050883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101072S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5735600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5735600","articleId":"5551150","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5551153,"authors":[{"name":"Ce Liu","affiliation":["Microsoft Research New England, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5735600/5551153/5551153-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ce Liu received the BS degree in automation and the ME degree in pattern recognition from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the PhD degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2009.

Analogous to optical flow, where an image is aligned to its temporally adjacent frame, we propose SIFT flow, a method to align an image to its nearest neighbors in a large image corpus containing a variety of scenes. The SIFT flow algorithm consists of matching densely sampled, pixelwise SIFT features between two images while preserving spatial discontinuities. The SIFT features allow robust matching across different scene/object appearances, whereas the discontinuity-preserving spatial model allows matching of objects located at different parts of the scene. Experiments show that the proposed approach robustly aligns complex scene pairs containing significant spatial differences. Based on SIFT flow, we propose an alignment-based large database framework for image analysis and synthesis, where image information is transferred from the nearest neighbors to a query image according to the dense scene correspondence. This framework is demonstrated through concrete applications such as motion field prediction from a single image, motion synthesis via object transfer, satellite image registration, and face recognition.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735600","startPage":"978","endPage":"994","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5735600/05551153.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIFT Flow: Dense Correspondence across Scenes and Its Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5551153/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"SIFT Flow: Dense Correspondence across Scenes and Its Applications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11874879","pubMedId":"20714019","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIFT Flow: Dense Correspondence across Scenes and Its Applications","sourcePdf":"ttp2011050978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137232S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5735600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"899","xplore-issue":"5735600","articleId":"5551153","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5551156,"authors":[{"name":"Dionysia K.

Such parameter variations, however, tend to affect logic and memory circuits in different ways. In logic, this fluctuation in device geometries might prevent them from meeting timing and power constraints and degrade the parametric yield. Memories, on the other hand, experience stability failures on account of such variations. Process limitations are not exhibited as physical disparities only; transistors experience temporal device degradation as well. Such issues are expected to further worsen with technology scaling. Resolving the problems of traditional Si-based technologies by employing non-Si alternatives may not present a viable solution; the non-Si miniature devices are expected to suffer the ill-effects of process/temporal variations as well. To circumvent these nonidealities, there is a need to design ICs that can adapt themselves to operate correctly under the presence of such inconsistencies. In this paper, we first provide an overview of the process variations and time-dependent degradation mechanisms. Next, we discuss the emerging paradigm of variation-tolerant adaptive design for both logic and memories. Interestingly, these resiliency techniques transcend several design abstraction levels-we present circuit and microarchitectural techniques to perform reliable computations in an unreliable environment.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2010.2057230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2010.2057230","startPage":"1718","endPage":"1751","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5580237/05551169.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter Variation Tolerance and Error Resiliency: New Design Paradigm for the Nanoscale Era","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Parameter Variation Tolerance and Error Resiliency: New Design Paradigm for the Nanoscale Era","volume":"98","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11528665","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5551169/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter Variation Tolerance and Error Resiliency: New Design Paradigm for the Nanoscale Era","sourcePdf":"jproc-ghosh-2057230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.281487S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5580237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5580237","articleId":"5551169","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5551174,"authors":[{"name":"Cristiano M.

Bilateral-mirrored contractions from ten able-bodied subjects were recorded along with isometric forces in multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) from the right wrist. An artificial neural network was trained to provide force estimation. Combinations of processing parameters were evaluated and an estimation algorithm allowing high accuracy from relatively short signal epochs (100 ms) was proposed. The estimation performance when using surface EMG from the contralateral limb was 0.90 0.02 for the able-bodied subjects. In comparison, the estimation performance for one subject with congenital malformation of the left forearm was 0.72 which, albeit lower than for able-bodied subjects, is still comparable to or better than previously reported results. The proposed method requires only the measured forces from one limb, such as in the case of unilateral amputees and has thus the potential to be used in clinical settings for intuitive, simultaneous control of multiple DOFs in myoelectric prostheses.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2010.2068298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5719227/05551179.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2010.2068298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5719227","startPage":"681","endPage":"688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous and Proportional Force Estimation for Multifunction Myoelectric Prostheses Using Mirrored Bilateral Training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous and Proportional Force Estimation for Multifunction Myoelectric Prostheses Using Mirrored Bilateral Training","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11833713","pubMedId":"20729161","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5551179/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous and Proportional Force Estimation for Multifunction Myoelectric Prostheses Using Mirrored Bilateral Training","sourcePdf":"tbme-farina-2068298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082782S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5719227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"5719227","articleId":"5551179","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5551180,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Jia","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5672100/5551180/5551180-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuan Jia received the B.E. degree in biomedical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004.

However, it is limited in terms of possible target numbers and, consequently, inappropriate for certain applications involving liquid crystal display (LCD) with multiple stimuli. This paper proposes an innovative coding method for SSVEP that, through a combination of frequency and phase, increases the number of targets, thus it improves the information transfer rate (ITR). With this method, a BCI system with 15 targets was developed using three stimulus frequencies, which is five times as many targets as the traditional method. Additionally, this paper defines the concept of reference phase, and decodes the EEG by means of Fourier coefficient projections onto the reference phase directions. Through the optimization of lead position, reference phase, data segment length, and harmonic components, the average ITR exceeded 60 bits/min in a simulated online test with ten subjects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11698309","htmlLink":"/document/5551180/","pubMedId":"20729160","displayDocTitle":"Frequency and Phase Mixed Coding in SSVEP-Based Brain--Computer Interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency and Phase Mixed Coding in SSVEP-Based Brain--Computer Interface","sourcePdf":"tbme-gao-2068571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061385S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5672100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"5672100","articleId":"5551180","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5551181,"authors":[{"name":"Mariano Llamedo","affiliation":["Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biomedica en Red de Bioingenier\u00eda, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), Zaragoza, Spain","Communications Technology Group, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain","CIBER, Zaragoza, Spain","Electronic Department, National Technological University, Buenos Aires, Argentina"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5719227/5551181/5551181-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mariano Llamedo was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1979.

A general formulation is reviewed for generating UF-SL-SAR imaging by using multiple frequencies across a wide band and by focusing in space to subsurface points using well-known ray refraction at the nominal ground surface. A full-wave finite-difference frequency-domain model is used to consider wave propagation in realistic soil with loss- and frequency-dependent dielectric constant and a randomly rough ground surface, both of which serve to obscure and distort the returned tunnel target signal. Imaging results are presented for two representative soil scenarios: dry sand and moist clay loam. Considering the ground surface ray refraction for focusing greatly improves the SAR image relative to conventional SAR focusing at the ground surface. Using UF-SL-SAR, a small shallow tunnel is reasonably imaged for the sand case, despite the roughness of the ground interface. However, for higher conductivity moist clay loam, the clutter from the rough surface overwhelms the significantly attenuated target signal, which must propagate through the lossy intervening soil. It is demonstrated that, despite ideal focusing, the tunnel is successfully imaged only for the sand case.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2051952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5673442/05551193.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2051952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673442","startPage":"65","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Limitations on Detecting Tunnels Using Underground-Focusing Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Physical Limitations on Detecting Tunnels Using Underground-Focusing Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551193/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704650","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5551193/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Limitations on Detecting Tunnels Using Underground-Focusing Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar","sourcePdf":"tgrs-martinezlorenzo-2051952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06265S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5673442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5673442","articleId":"5551193","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5551197,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/5623286/5551197/5551197-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ran Tao (M'00\u2013SM'04) was born in Nanling County, Anhui Province, China, in 1964.

Applying the transform orders of the utilized FRFT as secret keys, the proposed method is with a larger key space than the existing security systems based on the FRFT.

In this paper, we present a corner based approach to detect text and caption from videos. This approach is inspired by the observation that there exist dense and orderly presences of corner points in characters, especially in text and caption. We use several discriminative features to describe the text regions formed by the corner points. The usage of these features is in a flexible manner, thus, can be adapted to different applications. Language independence is an important advantage of the proposed method. Moreover, based upon the text features, we further develop a novel algorithm to detect moving captions in videos. In the algorithm, the motion features, extracted by optical flow, are combined with text features to detect the moving caption patterns. The decision tree is adopted to learn the classification criteria. Experiments conducted on a large volume of real video shots demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed approaches and the real-world system.

To address this issue, several reconstruction strategies have been recently proposed, which aim to recover the missing information either by exploiting the spatio-temporal correlations of the image series, or by imposing suitable constraints on the reconstructed image volume. The main contribution of this paper is to combine both these strategies in a compressed sensing framework by exploiting the gradient sparsity of the image volume. The resulting constrained 3D minimization problem is then solved using a penalized forward-backward splitting approach that leads to a convergent iterative two-step procedure. In the first step, the updating rule accords with the sequential nature of the data acquisitions, in the second step a truly 3D filtering strategy exploits the spatio-temporal correlations of the image sequences. The resulting NFCS-3D algorithm is very general and suitable for several kinds of medical image reconstruction problems. Moreover, it is fast, stable and yields very good reconstructions, even in the case of highly undersampled image sequences. The results of several numerical experiments highlight the optimal performance of the proposed algorithm and confirm that it is competitive with state of the art algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5760040/05551207.pdf","startPage":"1064","endPage":"1075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2068306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2068306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5760040","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Compressed Sensing Approach to 3D MR Image Reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Three dimensional displays","Minimization","Noise measurement","Compressed sensing","Biomedical imaging","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","data acquisition","image reconstruction","image sequences","medical image processing","spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast compressed sensing approach","3D MR image reconstruction","high-resolution image volume reconstruction","reduced frequency acquisition sequences","medical diagnosis","gradient sparsity","3D minimization problem","penalized forward-backward splitting approach","data acquisition","3D filtering strategy","spatiotemporal correlations","medical image reconstruction problems","state of the art algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing (CS)","medical image sequences","nonlinear filters","splitting methods","total variation minimization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Fourier Analysis","Heart","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Angiography","Phantoms, Imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Compressed Sensing Approach to 3D MR Image Reconstruction","volume":"30","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5551207/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11972233","pubMedId":"20729163","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Compressed Sensing Approach to 3D MR Image Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tmi-montefusco-2068306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123952S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5760040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5760040","articleId":"5551207","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5551212,"authors":[{"name":"An-Min Zou","affiliation":["Department of AeroSpace Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5559612/5551212/5551212-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["An-Min Zou received the B.E. degree in automation from Northeastern University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2007.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada, from 2007 to 2008.

Two robust adaptive output feedback controllers based on Chebyshev neural networks (CNN) termed adaptive neural networks (NN) controller-I and adaptive NN controller-II are proposed for the attitude tracking control of spacecraft. The four-parameter representations (quaternion) are employed to describe the spacecraft attitude for global representation without singularities. The nonlinear reduced-order observer is used to estimate the derivative of the spacecraft output, and the CNN is introduced to further improve the control performance through approximating the spacecraft attitude motion. The implementation of the basis functions of the CNN used in the proposed controllers depends only on the desired signals, and the smooth robust compensator using the hyperbolic tangent function is employed to counteract the CNN approximation errors and external disturbances. The adaptive NN controller-II can efficiently avoid the over-estimation problem (i.e., the bound of the CNNs output is much larger than that of the approximated unknown function, and hence, the control input may be very large) existing in the adaptive NN controller-I. Both adaptive output feedback controllers using CNN can guarantee that all signals in the resulting closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. For performance comparisons, the standard adaptive controller using the linear parameterization of spacecraft attitude motion is also developed. Simulation studies are presented to show the advantages of the proposed CNN-based output feedback approach over the standard adaptive output feedback approach.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2050333","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5559612/05551212.pdf","startPage":"1457","endPage":"1471","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2050333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quaternion-Based Adaptive Output Feedback Attitude Control of Spacecraft Using Chebyshev Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Quaternion-Based Adaptive Output Feedback Attitude Control of Spacecraft Using Chebyshev Neural Networks","volume":"21","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11489349","pubMedId":"20729168","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5551212/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quaternion-Based Adaptive Output Feedback Attitude Control of Spacecraft Using Chebyshev Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-kkumar-2050333-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128929S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5559612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5559612","articleId":"5551212","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5551213,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodi Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodi","lastName":"Li","id":"37539506700"},{"name":"Jianhua Shen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Shen","id":"37537783100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5551213","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":501},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Delay","Oscillators","Biological neural networks","Linear matrix inequalities","Symmetric matrices","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","discrete time systems","linear matrix inequalities","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","oscillations","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LMI","linear matrix inequality","interval neural network","discrete time-varying delay","distributed time-varying delay","impulsive perturbation","impulsive interval neural network","global exponential stability","stationary oscillation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential inequality","discrete time-varying delays","distributed time-varying delays","impulsive delay","impulsive perturbations interval neural networks","linear matrix inequality","stationary oscillation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Models, Neurological","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Stochastic Processes","Time Factors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551213","abstract":"In this paper, a class of impulsive interval neural networks with discrete and distributed time-varying delays is discussed.

been widely used in dc\u2013dc converters. In this paper, optimum dead-time and maximum switching frequency of a wide-adjustable-range LLC resonant converter are investigated for realizing the zero voltage switching (ZVS) operation even under the worst-case conditions. Analyses demonstrate that these parameters depend on the converter inductance ratio and ratio of the converter resonant capacitor and the effective capacitance appeared in parallel with the drain\u2013sources of the power MOSFETs. The necessary dead time for realizing the ZVS operation can be minimized by choosing the normalized maximum switching frequency, properly. Using the dead-time optimum value, soft switching is achieved for all power devices even under the worst-case conditions. Developed prototype of the converter has been tested under different loads (0\u20133 A dc) and input voltage conditions (320\u2013370 V dc) to achieve a wide-adjustable-range output voltage (40\u2013165 V dc).

A generalized situation is considered where the inverters are of unequal power ratings and the loads are nonlinear and unbalanced in nature. The proposed control algorithm exploits the potential of sinusoidal domain proportional+multiresonant controller (in the inner voltage regulation loop) to make the system suitable for nonlinear and unbalanced loads with a simple and generalized structure of virtual output-impedance loop. The decentralized operation is achieved by using three-phase P/Q droop characteristics. The overall control algorithm helps to limit the harmonic contents and the degree of unbalance in the output-voltage waveform and to achieve excellent power-sharing accuracy in spite of mismatch in the inverter output impedances. Moreover, a synchronized turn on with consequent change over to the droop mode is applied for the new incoming unit in order to limit the circulating current completely. The simulation and experimental results from -1 kVA and -0.5 kVA paralleled units validate the effectiveness of the scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5675792/05551218.pdf","startPage":"3015","endPage":"3025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2068313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2068313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5675792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Parallel Operation of Inverters Sharing Unbalanced and Nonlinear Loads","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Impedance","Voltage control","Phase locked loops","Wire","Reactive power","Converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralised control","distributed power generation","invertors","proportional control","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized parallel operation","nonlinear loads","unbalanced loads","wireless control strategy","three-phase four-wire inverters","proportional+multiresonant controller","inner voltage regulation loop","output-impedance loop","three-phase PIQ droop","microgrid","distributed generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microgrid","output impedance","proportional+ multiresonant controller","start-up phase-locked loop (PLL)","wireless control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Parallel Operation of Inverters Sharing Unbalanced and Nonlinear Loads","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5551218/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11704448","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Parallel Operation of Inverters Sharing Unbalanced and Nonlinear Loads","sourcePdf":"tpel-de-2068313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075132S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5675792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"5675792","articleId":"5551218","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5551239,"authors":[{"name":"Yekutiel Avargel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5621048/5551239/5551239-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yekutiel Avargel (S'06) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, in 2004, 2007, and 2008, respectively.","From 2003 to 2004, he was a Research Engineer with RAFAEL Research Laboratories, Haifa, Israel Ministry of Defense.

The identification scheme consists of a parallel connection of a linear component, represented by crossband filters between subbands, and a quadratic component, which is modeled by multiplicative cross-terms. We mainly concentrate on two types of undermodeling errors. The first is caused by employing a purely linear model in the estimation process (i.e., nonlinear undermodeling), and the second is a consequence of restricting the number of estimated crossband filters in the linear component. We derive analytical relations between the noise level, nonlinearity strength, and the obtainable mean-square error (mse) in subbands. We show that for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, a lower mse is achieved by allowing for nonlinear undermodeling and utilizing a purely linear model. However, as the SNR increases, the performance can be generally improved by incorporating a nonlinear component into the model. We further show that as the SNR increases, a larger number of crossband filters should be estimated to attain a lower mse, whether a linear or nonlinear model is employed. Experimental results support the theoretical derivations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2068296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05551239.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2068296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","startPage":"6052","endPage":"6065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Undermodeling-Error Quantification for Quadratically Nonlinear System Identification in the Short-Time Fourier Transform Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Undermodeling-Error Quantification for Quadratically Nonlinear System Identification in the Short-Time Fourier Transform Domain","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641774","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5551239/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Undermodeling-Error Quantification for Quadratically Nonlinear System Identification in the Short-Time Fourier Transform Domain","sourcePdf":"tsp-avargel-2068296-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099033S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5551239","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5551240,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Hui Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5621048/5551240/5551240-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Hui Chang (S'07\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communications engineering from the National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","During September 2006 and February 2008, he was an exchange Ph.D. student of the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.

The proposed method has applications ranging from user discrimination in wireless TV broadcast systems to the prevention of eavesdropping in secret communications. By considering a wireless MIMO system that consists of a multiple-antenna transmitter, a legitimate receiver (LR) and an unauthorized receiver (UR), we propose a multi-stage training-based discriminatory channel estimation (DCE) scheme that aims to optimize the channel estimation performance of the LR while limiting the channel estimation performance of the UR. The key idea is to exploit the channel estimate fed back from the LR at the beginning of each stage to enable the judicious use of artificial noise (AN) in the training signal. Specifically, with knowledge of the LR's channel, AN can be properly superimposed with the training data to degrade the UR's channel without causing strong interference on the LR. The channel estimation performance of the LR in earlier stages may not be satisfactory due to the inaccuracy of the channel estimate and constraints on the UR's estimation performance, but can improve rapidly in later stages as the quality of channel estimate improves. The training data power and AN power are optimally allocated by minimizing the normalized mean-square error (NMSE) of the LR subject to a lower limit constraint on the NMSE of the UR. The proposed DCE scheme is then extended to the case with multiple LRs and multiple URs. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCE scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2068292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05551240.pdf","startPage":"6223","endPage":"6237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2068292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training Sequence Design for Discriminatory Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551240/","displayDocTitle":"Training Sequence Design for Discriminatory Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems","volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641790","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551240/","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training Sequence Design for Discriminatory Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-chang-2068292-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103037S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5551240","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5551242,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9dric Herzet","affiliation":["INRIA-Centre Inria Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5621048/5551242/5551242-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["C\u00e9dric Herzet (M\u201908) was born in Verviers, Belgium, in 1978.

In particular, we focus on algorithms that compute the maximum-likelihood (ML) solution (exactly or in good approximation) with a tractable complexity, using a factor-graph representation.

Advantages of the method are that it is straightforward to parallelize, and that it offers a fully predictable runtime. PM trades performance for computational complexity via a user-defined parameter. In the limit of high computational complexity, the algorithm becomes the MAP demodulator. The PM algorithm also works with soft-input, but until now it has been unclear how to apply it for other modulation formats than binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) per real dimension. In this correspondence, we explain how to extend PM with soft-input to general signaling constellations, while maintaining the low complexity advantage of the original algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2068293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5662471/05551243.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2068293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Marginalization Soft MIMO Detection With Higher Order Constellations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Partial Marginalization Soft MIMO Detection With Higher Order Constellations","volume":"59","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11704202","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5551243/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Marginalization Soft MIMO Detection With Higher Order Constellations","sourcePdf":"tsp-persson-2068293-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108419S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5662471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5662471","articleId":"5551243","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5551247,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Gu Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5613993/5551247/5551247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyun Gu Kang (S'06) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering in 2004 from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, and the M.S.E. degree in electrical engineering in 2006 from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Since August 2004, he has been a Teaching and Research Assistant with the Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST.

One of the main goals of a cyber-physical energy system (CPES) is the integration of renewable energy sources and gridable vehicles (GVs) to maximize emission reduction. GVs can be used as loads, sources and energy storages in CPES. A large CPES is very complex considering all conventional and green distributed energy resources, dynamic data from sensors, and smart operations (e.g., charging/discharging, control, etc.) from/to the grid to reduce both cost and emission. If large number of GVs are connected to the electric grid randomly, peak load will be very high. The use of conventional thermal power plants will be economically expensive and environmentally unfriendly to sustain the electrified transportation. Intelligent scheduling and control of elements of energy systems have great potential for evolving a sustainable integrated electricity and transportation infrastructure. The maximum utilization of renewable energy sources using GVs for sustainable CPES (minimum cost and emission) is presented in this paper. Three models are described and results of the smart grid model show the highest potential for sustainability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11489156","volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5551257/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Utilization of Renewable Energy Sources by Gridable Vehicles in Cyber-Physical Energy Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Utilization of Renewable Energy Sources by Gridable Vehicles in Cyber-Physical Energy Systems","sourcePdf":"jsyst-saber-2059212-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106103S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5559614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5559614","articleId":"5551257","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5551262,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsoo Noh","affiliation":["Department of Printed Electronics Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Sunchon National University, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6104/5625011/5551262/5551262-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinsoo Noh received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Chosun University, Gwangju, Korea, in 2002, 2004, and 2007, respectively.","He was a Visiting Researcher at tje University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia, in 2008.

To enable the use of R2R gravure in printed electronics, the limits of overlay printing registration accuracy (OPRA) and the scalability of printed features with respect to the physical parameters of the gravure system, including given plastic substrates and inks, should be characterized. Important parameters of printed lines include surface roughness, thickness, line widening, and line-edge roughness. To date, there are no comprehensive reports regarding the limits of OPRA and the scalability of printed electrodes, including the control of surface roughness, thickness, line widening, and line-edge roughness using R2R gravure printing. In this paper, we examine ways of evaluating the OPRA limit of our gravure system. We find that OPRA is limited in the web moving direction to 40 \u03bcm and in the perpendicular direction to 16 \u03bcm, showing the importance of web handling on registration. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of printed electrodes formed using a R2R gravure system to linewidths of 317 \u03bcm, with 440 nm thickness, 30 nm of surface roughness and edge waviness of 4 \u03bcm on PET foils, and describe optimization strategies to realize improved surface roughness, thickness, line widening, and line-edge roughness for future printed electronics applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551262/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551262/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11656126","volume":"33","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scalability of Roll-to-Roll Gravure-Printed Electrodes on Plastic Foils","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalability of Roll-to-Roll Gravure-Printed Electrodes on Plastic Foils","sourcePdf":"tepm-noh-2057512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088952S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"5625011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"5625011","articleId":"5551262","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5551263,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitar P.

The framework employs procedures designed to temporally evolve the critical model parameters with experience for enhanced monitoring accuracy (a critical ability for mass deployment of the technology on a variety of equipment/hardware without needing extensive initial tune-up). Proposed approach makes explicit provision to characterize the distinct operating modes of the equipment, when necessary, and provides the ability to predict both abrupt as well as gradually developing (incipient) changes. The framework is realized as an autonomous software agent that continuously updates its decision model implementing an unsupervised recursive learning algorithm.

Finally, for task sets with sufficient slack, we show that inserting idle times between task executions can further reduce the peak temperature of the MPSoC quite significantly.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2058873","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2058873","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5978256/05551266.pdf","startPage":"1884","endPage":"1897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature-Aware Scheduling and Assignment for Hard Real-Time Applications on MPSoCs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Temperature-Aware Scheduling and Assignment for Hard Real-Time Applications on MPSoCs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12213377","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5551266/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature-Aware Scheduling and Assignment for Hard Real-Time Applications on MPSoCs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-chantem-2058873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130122S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5978256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"5978256","articleId":"5551266","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5551267,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5978256/5551267/5551267-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhuo Feng (S'03\u2013M'10) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2003, the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2009.","Since July 2009, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton.

For the first time, we show how to exploit recent massively parallel single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT)-based graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms to tackle large-scale power grid analysis with promising performance. Several key enablers including GPU-speciflc algorithm design, circuit topology transformation, workload partitioning, performance tuning are embodied in our GPU-accelerated hybrid multigrid (HMD) algorithm (GpuHMD) and its implementation. We also demonstrate that using the HMD solver as a preconditioner, the conjugate gradient solver can converge much faster to the true solution with good robustness. Extensive experiments on industrial and synthetic benchmarks have shown that for DC power grid analysis using one GPU, the proposed simulation engine achieves up to 100\u00d7 runtime speedup over a state-of-the-art direct solver and more than 50\u00d7 speedup over the CPU based multigrid implementation, while utilizing a four-core-four-GPU system, a grid with eight million nodes can be solved within about 1 s. It is observed that the proposed approach scales favorably with the circuit complexity, at a rate about 1 s per two million nodes on a single GPU card.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2059718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5978256/05551267.pdf","startPage":"1823","endPage":"1836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2059718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5978256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel On-Chip Power Distribution Network Analysis on Multi-Core-Multi-GPU Platforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551267/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel On-Chip Power Distribution Network Analysis on Multi-Core-Multi-GPU Platforms","volume":"19","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205584","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551267/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel On-Chip Power Distribution Network Analysis on Multi-Core-Multi-GPU Platforms","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-feng-2059718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09728S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5978256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5978256","articleId":"5551267","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5551269,"authors":[{"name":"Berk Canberk","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey","Broadband Wireless Networking Laboratory-BWNLab, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5714229/5551269/5551269-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Berk Canberk (S'10) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2003, and the M.Sc. degree in digital communication engineering from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, in 2005.

The Poisson modeling may lead to cases where primary user activities are modeled as smooth and burst-free traffic. As a result, this may cause the cognitive radio users to miss some available but unutilized spectrum, leading to lower throughput and high false-alarm probabilities. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a novel model to parametrize the primary user traffic in a more efficient and accurate way in order to overcome the drawbacks of the Poisson modeling. The proposed model makes this possible by arranging the first-difference filtered and correlated primary user data into clusters. In this paper, a new metric called the Primary User Activity Index, , is introduced, which accounts for the relation between the cluster filter output and correlation statistics. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by means of traffic estimation accuracy, false-alarm probabilities while keeping the detection probability of primary users at a constant value. Simulation results show that the appropriate selection of the Primary User Activity Index, higher primary-user detection accuracy, reduced false-alarm probabilities, and higher throughput can be achieved by the proposed model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551269/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","volume":"19","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11832677","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551269/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Primary User Activity Modeling Using First-Difference Filter Clustering and Correlation in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Primary User Activity Modeling Using First-Difference Filter Clustering and Correlation in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-canberk-2065031-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075708S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5714229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5714229","articleId":"5551269","onlineDate":"19 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5551272,"authors":[{"name":"Morgan Madec","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Syst\u00e8mes, InESS, UMR 7163, CNRS/UDS, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Morgan","lastName":"Madec","id":"37395046200"},{"name":"Christophe Lallement","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Syst\u00e8mes, InESS, UMR 7163, CNRS/UDS, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Lallement","id":"37344689300"},{"name":"Yves Gendrault","affiliation":["Institut d'Electronique du Solide et des Syst\u00e8mes, InESS, UMR 7163, CNRS/UDS, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Gendrault","id":"37546864500"},{"name":"Jacques Haiech","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Innovation Th\u00e9rapeutique, LIT, UMR 7200-CNRS/UdS, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Haiech","id":"37546901800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-928756-4-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7011-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5551272","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Biological system modeling","Logic gates","Mathematical model","Biological information theory","Microelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biotechnology","flip-flops","integrated circuit design","logic gates","simulation languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic biosystems","biotechnology","adapted CAD tools","microelectronics circuit design","synthesized biodevices behavior","bio-logic gate","T-flip-flop","HDL modeling languages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synthetic biology","design flow","top-down","HDL","biological NOR gate","biological flip-flop"]}],"abstract":"Synthetic biology is an emerging area of biotechnology for which main applications are in the field of Health and Environment.

These similarities lead to an efficient methodology, using microelectronics design flow, tools and methods, which should allow a top-down approach in synthetic biosystem design.

The process is very time consuming and there is a high risk of making mistakes. It would be much easier if there were a CAD tool doing part of the job for ourselves. This is the place where a possible solution comes in - the AMPLE script language in the ICStation environment. AMPLE is a script language that can be used to generate layouts. Apart form making a layout faster the AMPLE generator enables parametrisation of SI devices and can also be technology-independent. It provides a way for automating and speeding up the process of designing a layout. This paper presents a DCT layout generator which takes advantage of the AMPLE language and offers parametrisation that can make the design process independent from the technology used.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Discrete cosine transforms","Mirrors","Generators","Transistors","Analog circuits","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authoring languages","circuit layout CAD","discrete cosine transforms","integrated circuit layout","monolithic integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated DCT layout generation","SI circuits layout designing","CAD tool","AMPLE script language","ICstation environment","AMPLE generator","parametrisation","SI devices","design process","discrete cosine transform","script language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AMPLE","layout","discrete cosine transform","current mirror","analog circuit"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - MIXDES 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - MIXDES 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5543946/5551270/05551293.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated DCT layout generation using AMPLE language","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automated DCT layout generation using AMPLE language","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551293/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551293/","accessionNumber":"11487897","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated DCT layout generation using AMPLE language","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"34d4f90e96fae34b6348a09846ab1689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044001S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5543946","isNumber":"5551270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5543946","xplore-issue":"5551270","articleId":"5551293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"DEPT OF MICROELECTRON","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5551294,"authors":[{"name":"Samer Bou Habib","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Samer","lastName":"Bou Habib","id":"37534479500"},{"name":"Krzysztof Czuba","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Systems, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Czuba","id":"37266371500"},{"name":"Wojciech Jalmuzna","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland"],"firstName":"Wojciech","lastName":"Jalmuzna","id":"37546729000"},{"name":"Tomasz Jezynski","affiliation":["DESY, Hamburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Jezynski","id":"37546729700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-928756-4-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7011-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5551294","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Field programmable gate arrays","Radio frequency","Clocks","Frequency measurement","Jitter","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","data acquisition","field programmable gate arrays","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eight-channel ADC card design","signal conversion","direct analog-to-digital conversion","clock frequency","undersampling operation","LLRF system","FLASH accelerators","XFEL accelerators","ATCA board","FPGA unit","power supply circuits","diagnostic circuits","ATCA card","IPMI","CPU","data acquisition","data rates","circuit synchronization","high-quality clock signals","20-layer PCB design","signal transmission","signal matching","frequency 1.3 GHz","frequency 500 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LLRF","direct sampling","field detection","fast ADC","ATCA"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the design of an eight-channel ATCA card suited for direct analog-to-digital conversion of 1.3 GHz signals with a maximum ADC clock frequency of 500 MHz.

Although several data aggregation and compression techniques have been proposed in the literature only few of them can perform in-network compression and can extend lifetime without prior knowledge of the sensed data or without a central coordination. In this paper we consider a scenario where a wireless sensor network (WSN) exploits ZigBee protocols for smart building application. We study a classical gathering scheme and a distributed compressive sampling approach. We discuss limitations and we propose a new distributed mixed algorithm for in-network compression. With this algorithm each node takes a decision about which scheme to adopt aiming at the reducing the number of packets to transmit. We are interested in scalability of this new method and lifetime of the system with respect to the increase of network dimension. Simulations are performed using real data sets and results show that the use of this algorithm permits to obtain longer network lifetime with small computational complexity. The performances of the algorithm are also investigated when some sensor parameters are modified and sporadic readings rise in the network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing optimization over ZigBee networks","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Industrial Embedded System (SIES)","doi":"10.1109/SIES.2010.5551380","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Industrial Embedded System (SIES)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547587/5551360/05551380.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIES.2010.5551380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing optimization over ZigBee networks","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551380/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11487351","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing optimization over ZigBee networks","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"TF000507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547587","isNumber":"5551360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547587","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5551360","articleId":"5551380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5551387,"authors":[{"name":"Koldo Basterretxea","affiliation":["Department Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Bilbao, Spain"],"firstName":"Koldo","lastName":"Basterretxea","id":"37546811700"},{"name":"In\u00e9s del Campo","affiliation":["Department Electricity and Electronics, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Leioa, Spain"],"firstName":"In\u00e9s del","lastName":"Campo","id":"37546812500"},{"name":"Javier Echanobe","affiliation":["Department Electricity and Electronics, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Leioa, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Echanobe","id":"37546813000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5841-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5839-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5840-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3109"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3117"}],"articleNumber":"5551387","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Suspensions","Control systems","Training","Roads","Approximation methods","Inference algorithms","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive components","automotive electronics","control engineering computing","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy control","fuzzy reasoning","nonlinear control systems","piecewise linear techniques","suspensions (mechanical components)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-active suspension embedded controller","FPGA","piecewise multilinear fuzzy inference system","embedded digital controller","nonlinear controller","modified Skyhook control strategy","PWM-FIS","field programmable gate array","hardware-software partition methodology","parallel fuzzy controllers","four wheel vehicle suspension system","high-speed realtime advanced control requirements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Piece-Wise Multilinear Fuzzy Inference System (PWM-FIS)","semi-active suspension","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","embedded controller"]}],"abstract":"This paper explores the applicability of a Piece-Wise Multilinear Fuzzy Inference System (PWM-FIS) to the realization of embedded digital controllers for semi-active suspension systems.

We can show that observing the scratches by applying specific filters on the acquired image makes the detection very simple and reliable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scratch detector\u2013A FPGA based system for scratch detection in industrial picture development","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Industrial Embedded System (SIES)","doi":"10.1109/SIES.2010.5551390","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Industrial Embedded System (SIES)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547587/5551360/05551390.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIES.2010.5551390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551360","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Scratch detector\u2013A FPGA based system for scratch detection in industrial picture development","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551390/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11487361","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scratch detector\u2013A FPGA based system for scratch detection in industrial picture development","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"TF000825.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05715S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547587","isNumber":"5551360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547587","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5551360","articleId":"5551390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5551436,"authors":[{"name":"B.

These complexities suggest that benefits could be derived from the development and implementation of advanced process control tools and strategies. Empirical process models are one of these tools. In this research, sequential neural network models were developed to characterize critical steps in a fabrication process. The data used were collected from an industrial process, a distinguishing feature of this research. Typically the data used to train neural network models comes from designed (factorial) experiments. Here, the data came from experiments related to the processes under investigation, but not specifically designed to generate data for modeling. The models performed well demonstrating the flexibility of the sequential neural network modeling process. Additionally, the models were used in a sensitivity analysis to study the output response to the various inputs. Future work will include using the models as part of a model-based supervisory control system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551439/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11487492","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551439/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","conferenceDate":"11-13 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for advanced process control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for advanced process control","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2932.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089843S","chronDate":"11-13 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5546816","isNumber":"5551403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5546816","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5551403","articleId":"5551439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5551440,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Ting Lin","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Ting","lastName":"Lin","id":"37536587100"},{"name":"Chin-Chang Huang","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Chang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37539990600"},{"name":"Chin-Yi Yang","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Yi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37537204200"},{"name":"Yao-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37539910900"},{"name":"Chin-Sheng Lu","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Sheng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37538959600"},{"name":"Po-Yueh Tsai","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Yueh","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37089123106"},{"name":"Chih-Mu Huang","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Mu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37078286400"},{"name":"Ying-Lang Wang","affiliation":["Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Lang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281443500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6519-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6517-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6518-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6697"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1078-8743"},{"format":"CD","value":"1078-8743"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1078-8743"}],"articleNumber":"5551440","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inspection","Monitoring","Mass production","Time frequency analysis","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sampling","process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defect intelligent sampling system","defect-ISS","in-line defect inspection","process control method","technology node mass production environment","process tools"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551440","abstract":"This paper describes a new paradigm of defect sampling, the Defect Intelligent Sampling System (Defect-ISS), which introduces a far more effective in-line defect inspection and process control method in a diverse product and technology node mass production environment.

It shows that the risks can be strongly reduced while keeping a limited number of measures.","doi":"10.1109/ASMC.2010.5551470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMC.2010.5551470","startPage":"307","endPage":"310","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference (ASMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5546816/5551403/05551470.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference (ASMC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A smart sampling algorithm to minimize risk dynamically","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A smart sampling algorithm to minimize risk dynamically","conferenceDate":"11-13 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551470/","accessionNumber":"11487472","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551470/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A smart sampling algorithm to minimize risk dynamically","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"64104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045051S","chronDate":"11-13 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5546816","isNumber":"5551403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5546816","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5551403","articleId":"5551470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5551474,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Hess","affiliation":["PDF Solutions, Inc.orporated, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Hess","id":"37268599400"},{"name":"Anand Inani","affiliation":["PDF Solutions, Inc.orporated, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Inani","id":"37546788400"},{"name":"Amit Joag","affiliation":["PDF Solutions, Inc.orporated, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Joag","id":"37546792500"},{"name":"Sa Zhao","affiliation":["PDF Solutions, Inc.orporated, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sa","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37540249200"},{"name":"Mark Spinelli","affiliation":["PDF Solutions, Inc.orporated, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Spinelli","id":"37546792300"},{"name":"Michael Zaragoza","affiliation":["PDF Solutions, Inc.orporated, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Zaragoza","id":"37546790800"},{"name":"Long Nguyen","affiliation":["Global Foundries, Inc., San Jose, Germany","PDF Solutions, Inc.orporated, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37534998400"},{"name":"Binod Kumar","affiliation":["Global Foundries, Inc., San Jose, Germany","PDF Solutions, Inc.orporated, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Binod","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37089117764"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6519-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6517-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6518-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6697"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1078-8743"},{"format":"CD","value":"1078-8743"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1078-8743"}],"articleNumber":"5551474","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observability","Vehicles","Manufacturing","Metals","Testing","Monitoring","Stacking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design for testability","semiconductor device testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stackable short flow characterization vehicle test chip","test chip design","mask cost","engineering wafer","semiconductor manufacturing","test chip area"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551474","doi":"10.1109/ASMC.2010.5551474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMC.2010.5551474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551403","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference (ASMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference (ASMC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5546816/5551403/05551474.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stackable short flow Characterization Vehicle test chip to reduce test chip designs, mask cost and engineering wafers","abstract":"Being successful in semiconductor manufacturing is increasingly challenging for sub 100 nm technology nodes.

At the same time, design rules are more and more complex demanding more experiments and thus more test chip area to characterize a technology. In short, more and more experiments have to be packed into less test chip area, while reducing overall test time and increasing learning cycles.

The board also contains an interface block with an analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADC/DAC). The learning algorithm has been implemented on both \u03bcCs for the comparison. The board allows for switching between the \u03bcCs, between the Euclidean and the Manhattan distance measures. It also allows for turning on/off the so-called conscience mechanism. The learning process can be observed on-line due to DACs used on the board. Other network parameters can be viewed on PC using the USB port.

Particularly the stage of feature extraction, that is responsible for reducing the resources required to describe speech samples accurately requires algorithms of large complexity. State of the art speaker verification systems are based on cepstral features like MFCC, LFCC or LPCC. In these methods of features extraction the most computing extensive part is spectral averaging using windows in frequency domain. In this paper we propose a feature extraction system based on the LFCC with novel architecture for spectral averaging. Proposed solution is optimized for implementation in programmable structures as System on Programmable Chip and significantly reduces feature extraction execution time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Field programmable gate arrays","Speech","Feature extraction","Program processors","Nonlinear filters","Maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstral analysis","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker verification","FPGA","feature extraction algorithm","speaker identification","LFCC","spectral averaging","system on programmable chip","linear-scale filterbank cepstral coefficiens"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speaker identification","Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficiens","FPGA","low power application"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551699","startPage":"557","endPage":"561","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - MIXDES 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 17th International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - MIXDES 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5543946/5551270/05551699.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551270","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551699/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of feature extraction algorithm for speaker verification","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487950","htmlLink":"/document/5551699/","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of feature extraction algorithm for speaker verification","confLoc":"Wroclaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"8d9b15417b5e08e5faf88bfe33ddc56c.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076356S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5543946","isNumber":"5551270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5543946","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5551270","articleId":"5551699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"DEPT OF MICROELECTRON","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5551710,"authors":[{"name":"Ted Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technology and Science Institute of Northern Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ted","lastName":"Tao","id":"37529543600"},{"name":"Ti-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Information and Network Engineering, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ti-Hung Chen","id":"37334520800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6474-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6472-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6473-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-0909"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-0925"}],"articleNumber":"5551710","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cerebellar model arithmetic computers","field programmable gate arrays","firmware","fuzzy set theory","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","hardware description languages","image reconstruction","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMAC coding schemes","FPGA","image reconstruction","neural networks","fuzzy algorithms","firmware memory","learning ability","generalization ability","VHDL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Firmware memory","CMAC","FPGA","VHDL"]}],"abstract":"Traditional hardware memory cannot generalize or learn from neighborhood information.

Unfortunately, these non-ideal analog components cause inevitable mismatch of the analog circuits and digital noise cancellation filters; consequently it leads to a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, the SNR performance enhancement problem is formulated as a robust H-infinity filtering problem in finite frequency domain. Specifically, we propose a heuristic finite impulse response (FIR) filter design that deals with the problem by treating the non-ideality as parametric uncertainty in the integrators' pole and zero of the modulators. In contrast with the existing approaches, the proposed design is a direct approach which directly adjusts the gain responses of the noise transfer function to yield high-order noise shaping by searching the coefficients of FIR filters via solving linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility problems. We have confirmed the validity of the proposed method via simulations of a cascaded 2-1 modulator with 2% deviation in the analog integrators. Simulation results show that the modulator matched by the proposed filter achieves better SNR performance than that matched by the conventional one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11477515","htmlLink":"/document/5551821/","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A heuristic finite frequency H-infinity filtering technique with application to cascaded 2-1 sigma-delta modulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heuristic finite frequency H-infinity filtering technique with application to cascaded 2-1 sigma-delta modulators","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05252S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5540658","isNumber":"5551700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5540658","xplore-issue":"5551700","articleId":"5551821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5551831,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Yang","id":"37534303100"},{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089062923"},{"name":"Li-fen Lin","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Li-fen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37089063523"},{"name":"Chao-dong Ling","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Huaqiao University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Chao-dong","lastName":"Ling","id":"37534435100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6734-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6731-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6733-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-5048"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2163-5056"}],"articleNumber":"5551831","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1982},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Choppers","Noise","Low pass filters","Power harmonic filters","CMOS integrated circuits","Capacitance","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","low-pass filters","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power low-noise CMOS chopper amplifier","low-frequency offset","1-f noise","two-stage amplifier","equivalent Miller capacitance","low pass filter","TSMC CMOS process","size 0.18 mum","voltage 1.8 V","frequency 100 Hz","power 117 muW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chopper amplifier","low-noise","equivalent input noise","low-pass filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551831","abstract":"Chopping technique is an efficient approach to decrease the low-frequency offset and 1/f noise of amplifiers.

A Loadless 4T CMOS SRAM cell has the requirement that the leakage current of the PMOS access transistors should be larger than the leakage current of the NMOS drive transistors to maintain state. In this paper, we introduce a p-type TFET with a degenerately doped source, which has a kT/q sub-threshold slope, compared to an n-type TFET which has a sub-kT/q slope.

Further, the asymmetric source drain architecture of the TFETs is exploited to solve the adjacent bit flip problem of unselected Loadless 4T SRAM cells during a column write operation. Finally, we include a comparison of the leakage energy and cell access time of the TFET based SRAM cell and benchmark its performance relative to state-of-the-art CMOS based 6T SRAM cells.","doi":"10.1109/DRC.2010.5551859","publicationTitle":"68th Device Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"68th Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5543947/5551849/05551859.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRC.2010.5551859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power Loadless 4T SRAM cell based on degenerately doped source (DDS) In<inf>0.53</inf>Ga<inf>0.47</inf>As Tunnel FETs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551859/","displayDocTitle":"Low Power Loadless 4T SRAM cell based on degenerately doped source (DDS) In<inf>0.53</inf>Ga<inf>0.47</inf>As Tunnel FETs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551859/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11487733","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power Loadless 4T SRAM cell based on degenerately doped source (DDS) In<inf>0.53</inf>Ga<inf>0.47</inf>As Tunnel FETs","confLoc":"Notre Dame, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"48POSTER26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069194S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5543947","isNumber":"5551849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5543947","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5551849","articleId":"5551859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5551869,"authors":[{"name":"Shahrukh A.

To ensure complete programmability, each driver magnet will need to be set independently. This can be accomplished by changing magnet aspect ratio. As the length of the magnet increases along its easy axis, its coercivity in that direction increases. Thus, it will require a higher magnetic field for re-magnetization. Quantitative simulation data are shown in Fig. 3 (obtained via simulations with NIST's OOMMF suite2). The M-H curves show increasing coercivity for 60x90x30 nm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n and 60x230x30 nm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n supermalloy magnets. One can clearly see that a higher magnetic field is needed to switch that state of the higher aspect ratio magnet. Thus, if we vary the lengths of the driver (horizontal) magnets of the majority gate shown in Fig. 1c, and any applied external field is (i) sufficient to set the state of a target driver, (ii) insufficient to switch other (longer) driver(s), and (iii) sufficient to place the other (vertical) magnets in the gate into a metastable state (per Fig. 2), then the drivers can retain their distinct initial magnetization state even after the entire gate process is complete. This has been experimentally demonstrated and we discuss results below. We have demonstrated the independent programmability of the driver magnets of the majority gate to obtain all logic variations in one physical layout. This demonstrates fully programmable logic which is especially important when considering how to use this technology at the functional unit level.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programmable nanomagnet-logic majority gate","publicationTitle":"68th Device Research Conference","doi":"10.1109/DRC.2010.5551921","displayPublicationTitle":"68th Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5543947/5551849/05551921.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRC.2010.5551921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Programmable nanomagnet-logic majority gate","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551921/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11487818","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programmable nanomagnet-logic majority gate","confLoc":"Notre Dame, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"40POSTER18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057468S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5543947","isNumber":"5551849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5543947","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5551849","articleId":"5551921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5551933,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The single-gate (SG) extremely thin SOI (ETSOI) MOSFET, the double-gate (DG) FinFET, and the gate-all-around (GAA) Si nanowire (SiNW) MOSFET geometries may facilitate such scaling. Nevertheless, sub-10nm L\u03b1 scaling will be a great challenge because of the significant mobility degradation and channel thickness variations in the aforementioned geometries with a few-nanometer body thicknesses as required by electrostatic short-channel considerations. Therefore, new device geometries and technologies are required that could simultaneously maintain the electrostatic integrity and the superior transport properties for sub-lOnm L\u03b1 scaling. It has been recently shown that the atomic-thin-body (ATB) geometry can meet the electrostatic requirements for LG <; 10nm. At the ATB limit, carbon electronics based on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with tunable band gaps have been widely considered for high-performance digital electronics. Here, ballistic transport of GNR Schottky-barrier (SB) FETs is simulated self-consistently, including both thermionic emission and tunneling. We show the better gate length scalability of GNRs compared to Si MOSFETs, even though significant material related challenges will have to be overcome. L\u03b1 scaling below 10nm is mainly limited by direct source-to-drain tunneling and the ambipolar effect in the off-state, which can be suppressed by narrower ribbon widths (of the order ~ 10nm), and larger effective masses obtained from band structure engineering. If a negative metal-graphene SB-height could be achieved, the GNR SB-FET could operate without significant series resistance effects, and deliver high on-current (I\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ON</sub>\n ). The performance of the ultimate GNR SB-FETs is comparable to the MOSFET targets of the ITRS roadmap.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graphene nanoribbon Schottky-barrier FETs for end-of-the-roadmap CMOS: Challenges and opportunities","publicationTitle":"68th Device Research Conference","doi":"10.1109/DRC.2010.5551933","displayPublicationTitle":"68th Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5543947/5551849/05551933.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DRC.2010.5551933","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5551933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Graphene nanoribbon Schottky-barrier FETs for end-of-the-roadmap CMOS: Challenges and opportunities","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5551933/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11487767","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graphene nanoribbon Schottky-barrier FETs for end-of-the-roadmap CMOS: Challenges and opportunities","confLoc":"Notre Dame, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"35POSTER13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043943S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5543947","isNumber":"5551849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5543947","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5551849","articleId":"5551933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5551946,"authors":[{"name":"Arijit Raychowdhury","affiliation":["Circuits Research Laboratory, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Arijit","lastName":"Raychowdhury","id":"37273985900"},{"name":"Dinesh Somasekhar","affiliation":["Circuits Research Laboratory, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Somasekhar","id":"37285025700"},{"name":"Tanay Karnik","affiliation":["Circuits Research Laboratory, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Tanay","lastName":"Karnik","id":"37268291400"},{"name":"Vivek K.

A magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device (Fig. 1) is used as the information storage memory element, and its magneto-resistance is used for information read-out. To make the STT-RAM technology competitive with mainstream semiconductor memories, the writing current has to be reduced so that the MTJ can be switched by a minimum sized CMOS transistor. In this paper, we discuss our approaches and results in writing current reduction; device read and write performances; robustness against read disturb switching and barrier break down; and prospects of scaling to future smaller nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5551975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11487833","htmlLink":"/document/5551975/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Non-volatile spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-volatile spin-transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM)","confLoc":"Notre Dame, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"117VIIA1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032679S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5543947","isNumber":"5551849","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5543947","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5551849","articleId":"5551975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5552027,"authors":[{"name":"R.

infrared (TIR) remote sensing is recognized as a powerful tool for collecting, analyzing and modeling of energy fluxes and temperature variations. Traditional aircraft, satellite or ground TIR platforms can provide valuable regional-scale environmental information. However, these platforms have limitations, such as expensive cost, complicated manipulation, etc. In comparison, small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have many advantages in TIR remote sensing applications over traditional platforms. In this paper, a low-cost UAV-based TIR remote sensing platform: AggieAir-TIR is introduced. AggieAir-TIR is a small, low-cost, flexible TIR remote sensing platform, which was accomplished at the Center for Self Organizing and Intelligent Systems (CSOIS) in Utah State University (USU). The detailed introduction of AggieAir-TIR remote sensing platform is provided in the paper. Furthermore, a low-cost TIR imaging camera calibration experiment is designed, and the calibration results are provided.

of droplet routing in digital microfluidic biochip","abstract":"One of the challenging research areas nowadays is the design and use of microfluidic biochips, the digital microfluidic biochips (DMFB). It is used for analysis of different biological samples like protein, sirum etc using an array of electrically controlled electrodes. This paper deals with a challenging problem related to the design of DMFB. Specifically the design problem considered is related to high-performance droplet routing, where each droplet has single source location and single target location. The objectives are (i) minimizing the number of electrodes used in the DMFB, and (ii) minimizing total routing time/latest arrival time of all the droplet at their target locations. We propose a simple algorithm for concurrent path allocation to multiple droplets, based on the classical shortest-path algorithm, together with the use of stalling, and possible detouring of droplets in cases of contentions. The algorithm is also extended to droplet routing where a droplet may have two source positions and a single target position. The algorithm is implemented on a Linux platform and empirical results are quite encouraging.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552059/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552059/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11511028","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Method of droplet routing in digital microfluidic biochip","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Method of droplet routing in digital microfluidic biochip","confLoc":"QingDao, China","sourcePdf":"0045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068802S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547546","isNumber":"5551988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547546","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5551988","articleId":"5552059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5552064,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjia Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37538055000"},{"name":"Bo Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering-Engineering Mechanics and the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406616700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7101-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7102-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5552064","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552064","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Biological cells","Mobile communication","Sensors","Variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised monitoring","condition monitoring","genetic algorithms","mobile agents","structural engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware distribution","monitoring agents","genetic algorithms","mobile agent-based monitoring network","sensor feature vectors","sensor node battery capacity","damage diagnosis program","damage detection","mobile monitoring agents","structural health monitoring network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithms","monitoring networks","structural health monitoring"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MESA.2010.5552064","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547546/5551988/05552064.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2010 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications","startPage":"257","endPage":"262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5551988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MESA.2010.5552064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-aware distribution of monitoring agents using Genetic Algorithms","abstract":"In a mobile agent-based monitoring network, mobile monitoring agents travel over the network to detect abnormal conditions in real-time. Each mobile monitoring agent is a damage diagnosis program which can recognize certain type of damage. To achieve effective damage detection and prolong the lifetime of a monitoring network, this paper studies energy-aware distribution of mobile monitoring agents using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The goal of the GA-based algorithm is to distribute monitoring agents to sensor nodes where sensor feature vectors have high affinities with memory cells of a monitoring agent and the remaining battery capacity of the sensor node is above a predefined threshold. With this distribution strategy, the system is able to send certain type of monitoring agents to the site where they are needed. When there are more than one sensor nodes in the suspicious region, the sensor node with high remaining battery capacity will have higher priority to receive a mobile monitoring agent. This distribution scheme makes the remaining battery capacity of sensor nodes in the network more balanced so that the lifetime of the monitoring network is extended.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552064/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11477773","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552064/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy-aware distribution of monitoring agents using Genetic Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-aware distribution of monitoring agents using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"QingDao, China","sourcePdf":"0046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065224S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547546","isNumber":"5551988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547546","xplore-issue":"5551988","articleId":"5552064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5552100,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Hoffrichter","affiliation":["University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Hoffrichter"},{"name":"Stuart Hillmansen","affiliation":["University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Stuart","lastName":"Hillmansen"},{"name":"Clive Roberts","affiliation":["University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Clive","lastName":"Roberts"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-84919-211-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5552100","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrogen","railway industry","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrogen propelled railway vehicles","railway industry","petroleum oil products","hydrogen powered trains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hydrogen","Fuel Cell","Railway Vehicles"]}],"abstract":"The railway industry is under pressure to reduce emissions, and reduction of the dependency on petroleum oil products is desirable.

It possesses the environmental benefits, at the vehicle, of an electric locomotive but the higher overall energy efficiency and lower infrastructure costs of a diesel. The natural fuel for a fuelcell is hydrogen, which can be produced from many renewable energies or nuclear energy, and thus a hydrogenfuelcell locomotive will not depend on imported oil. Hydrogen produced from renewable primary energies or nuclear energy would provide a totally zero-emissions vehicle, that is, with zero carbon in the energy cycle. A North American consortium a project partnership among BNSF Railway Company, the US Army Corps of Engineers, and Vehicle Projects Inc has developed a prototype hydrogen-fueled fuelcell-battery hybrid shunt locomotive for urban and military-base rail applications (see Fig. 1). This prototype is intended to lead to commercial locomotives, including freight, that will (1) reduce air and noise pollution in urban railyards, (2) increase energy security of the rail transport system by using hydrogen as fuel, (3) reduce atmospheric greenhouse-gas emissions, and (4) serve as a mobile backup power source (\"vehicle-to-grid\") for critical infrastructure on military bases. The locomotive is presently at a BNSF railyard in the Los Angeles metro area, where it will commence its demonstration phase under working conditions. At 130 tonne, continuous net power of 240 kW from its proton-exchange membrane fuelcell prime mover, and transient power well in excess of 1 MW, the hybrid locomotive is the heaviest and most powerful fuelcell land vehicle yet built.

From mid-90's, the mainline railway management has undergone revamps to revitalize the intra-modal competitiveness of railway transportation and to steer it toward the direction of modern business management. With the rapid economic growth; the large-scale expansion of the mainline network; and the increasing expectation on service, the mainline railways in China require further restructuring. Inevitably, a sustainable approach to ensure business viability and service quality in the next few decades is an imminent challenge. This paper reviews the operations and management of mainline railway in China and discusses the possibility of introducing open access market. Drawing the experiences on railway open markets outside China, the discussions include the need and feasibility of railway open market in China; and the suitability and limitations of different models. Particular considerations will be given to the unique characteristics of the mainline railways in China, where the developments across neighbouring regions are unbalanced; freight and passenger services are of similar demands; and the high-speed train operations are operated with low-speed ones in mixed traffic.","doi":"10.1049/ic.2010.0044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic.2010.0044","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547927/5552097/05552103.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility of open markets for mainline railways in China","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552103/","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility of open markets for mainline railways in China","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11431800","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility of open markets for mainline railways in China","confLoc":"Birmingham","sourcePdf":"20100044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02297S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2010","isNumber":"5552097","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547927","articleId":"5552103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5552105,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

However, this does not necessarily yield all of the net energy savings that are possible if other trains are running within the same electrical section. Further savings may be available during motoring by using energy regenerated by other trains while they are braking. This paper first presents a single train trajectory optimisation to obtain minimum energy consumption with maximum regenerated energy, and then considers net energy reduction between two adjacent DC substations when the optimised trajectories are used. Each trajectory is optimised individually using a genetic algorithm to search for the best possible compromise between energy consumption and journey time requirements. A weighted combination of these two is used as the objective function and the rates of train acceleration, braking and coasting form a set of variables that define a driving strategy. In order to estimate the benefits and effects of optimised trajectories on net energy consumption, multi-train simulation was then performed for both fastest and optimised journeys. Both qualitatively and quantitatively, the results suggest that further considerable reductions of net energy consumption may be achieved by the adjustment of schedules for both the up and down direction so as to increase the receptivity of those trains within each subsection, or by the recalculation of single train trajectories with different optimisation criteria. Finally, consideration is given to the possible application of the technique on a real railway traction system. Although demonstrated here on a DC system, the method could equally be applied to AC electrified railways.","doi":"10.1049/ic.2010.0038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic.2010.0038","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547927/5552097/05552109.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of train and net energy consumption using genetic algorithms for Trajectory Optimisation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552109/","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of train and net energy consumption using genetic algorithms for Trajectory Optimisation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11431794","publicationDate":"April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of train and net energy consumption using genetic algorithms for Trajectory Optimisation","confLoc":"Birmingham","sourcePdf":"20100038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077708S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2010","isNumber":"5552097","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547927","citationCount":"31","articleId":"5552109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5552110,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Prime movers are usually distributed along the length of the train, and are able to provide distributed traction. If the primary power for such vehicles comes from individual diesel engines, or if there are non-linear efficiency characteristics within the drive train, then the supervisory controllers for each motive unit may be decoupled and operated independently. This can potentially save energy. This paper investigates two global optimisation algorithms. These are the dynamic programming method, and the greedy algorithm. Both of these two graphic searching algorithms help to find the optimum power distribution between engines for a typical Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) train. It is found that the application of Dijkstra's Algorithm, in association with a Fibonacci heap (F-heap) based advanced data structure, can significantly improve the computing efficiency while maintaining the same optimisation precision as the dynamic programming method.

Various studies have been undertaken to derive and formulate solutions to this route allocation problem (RAP) which is particularly evident in mainland China nowadays because of the growing traffic demand and limited station capacity. A reasonable solution must be selected from a set of available RAP solutions attained in the planning stage to facilitate station operation. The selection is however based on the experience of the operators only and objective evaluation of the solutions is rarely addressed. In order to maximise the utilisation of station capacity while maintaining service quality and allowing for service disturbance, quantitative evaluation of RAP solutions is highly desirable. In this study, quantitative evaluation of RAP solutions is proposed and it is enabled by a set of indices covering infrastructure utilisation, buffer times and delay propagation. The proposed evaluation is carried out on a number of RAP solutions at a real-life busy railway station in mainland China and the results highlight the effectiveness of the indices in pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions. This study provides the necessary platform to improve the RAP solution in planning and to allow train re-routing upon service disturbances.","doi":"10.1049/ic.2010.0031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic.2010.0031","publicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547927/5552097/05552114.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative evaluation of route allocation solutions at large-scale passenger stations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IET","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative evaluation of route allocation solutions at large-scale passenger stations","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11431787","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552114/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative evaluation of route allocation solutions at large-scale passenger stations","confLoc":"Birmingham","sourcePdf":"20100031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030245S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2010","isNumber":"5552097","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547927","articleId":"5552114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5552117,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The profile is set up to save energy by making use of unused recovery time in the timetable. The recovery time is used up at the end of each inter-station journey by \"coasting\", i.e. reducing power to idle and allowing the train to decelerate gradually. An off-train performance calculator is used to generate the profiles for each stopping pattern, route and rolling stock type. The profile fully respects the stops and important passing points in the operating timetable. The system is very easy to use and requires only a power supply from the train. It can be quickly installed on legacy and mid-life rolling stock. It comprises an in-cab display, a processor unit and a GPS receiver. The software element of the system will also be able to be run on most train management systems and on recent rolling stock which already has on-board processing power and GPS feeds and so will need no additional hardware. The algorithm used by the system adjusts the coasting position according to whether the train is early or late to maximise the energy-saving potential whilst ensuring that no important timing point is missed through coasting. The basic driver's display consists of just two screens a train selection screen and a real time display. Once the train has been selected at the start of its run, the real time screen shows the current position against its timetable. A simple graphic display shows time ahead or behind, with a numeric indicator as well. The driver need only glance at the unit to be aware of the train's time against its timetable.

It has been widely argued that railway electrification is needed on more routes, but it is more difficult to construct a financial case for doing so. One such case is the heavily-used Trans-Pennine route from Manchester to Leeds via Dewsbury and Huddersfield. The main operator on this route, First TransPennine Express, is currently using high-powered diesel multiple units in order to adhere to stringent performance criteria. These trains are frequently overcrowded at peak times, because the route serves commuters who travel to Leeds, York and Manchester from throughout the North of England, as well as longer-distance travellers. Electrifying the Trans-Pennine route would not be an easy task. There are many areas where the railway is built in cuttings, tunnels, on the side of hills and round tight curves. One way to deal with this problem would be to electrify the railway discontinuously, that is to only install catenary where it is cheap and easy to do so. Modern energy storage techniques could then be used to ensure that trains always have an adequate supply of power. This tradeoff would reduce the overall cost of electrification and therefore enable compelling business cases to be established for more routes.","doi":"10.1049/ic.2010.0019","publicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547927/5552097/05552126.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic.2010.0019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigating discontinuous electrification and energy storage on the northern Trans-Pennine route","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Investigating discontinuous electrification and energy storage on the northern Trans-Pennine route","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552126/","publicationDate":"April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11431775","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating discontinuous electrification and energy storage on the northern Trans-Pennine route","confLoc":"Birmingham","sourcePdf":"20100019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076832S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2010","isNumber":"5552097","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547927","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5552126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5552129,"authors":[{"name":"W.

All electrical elements along the railway, even including the short circuits and conductor breaks, can be described as series or shunt elements. According to the chain circuit topology, the mathematical model of the whole feeding system, i.e. the admittance matrix, can be assembled conveniently by appropriately modelling each element. Considering the relatively large leakage conductance of the current return rail to the ground, multi-conductor equivalent-\u03c0 circuits can be adopted for each section of the feeding system. The characteristic admittance matrix, which can be calculated by the phase-modal transformation method, is introduced for the truncation treatment at terminals of a feeding system. The proposed modelling methodology has been realised using a simulation program, which can be used to investigate a wide range of problems in electric railway feeding systems, such as the conductor current distribution, the lowest train voltage at peak time, the short circuit calculation, the rail potential distribution and the harmonic propagation.","doi":"10.1049/ic.2010.0018","publicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547927/5552097/05552129.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic.2010.0018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of AC feeding systems of electric railways based on a uniform multi-conductor chain circuit topology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of AC feeding systems of electric railways based on a uniform multi-conductor chain circuit topology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552129/","publicationDate":"April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11431774","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of AC feeding systems of electric railways based on a uniform multi-conductor chain circuit topology","confLoc":"Birmingham","sourcePdf":"20100018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030287S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2010","isNumber":"5552097","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547927","citationCount":"15","articleId":"5552129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5552131,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

To assess the power quality of the railway supply networks needs to model not only the fundamental currents of the trains but also their harmonic contents. It is difficult to simulate accurately the dynamic current waveforms of an electric locomotive running on real lines because there are too many random or uncontrolled factors that can intervene the working state of the main power circuit of the locomotive. This paper presents a modelling method which can be used to imitate the probabilistic property of the current waveform and can be embedded in the train simulator. This method is based on statistical analysis of a large amount of measured data of locomotive currents that were acquired on actual railway line. A computer program has been developed for the 8K locomotive, a kind of widely used locomotives for freight services in China. The program has been applied to assess the power quality of railway power supply utilities, which shows that this modelling method can give a very realistic result from the statistics point of view and has a fast speed in the simulation.","doi":"10.1049/ic.2010.0016","publicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"IET Conference on Railway Traction Systems (RTS 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547927/5552097/05552131.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/ic.2010.0016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic load modelling of electric locomotive for power quality assessment of utilities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic load modelling of electric locomotive for power quality assessment of utilities","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552131/","publicationDate":"April 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11431772","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"13-15 April 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic load modelling of electric locomotive for power quality assessment of utilities","confLoc":"Birmingham","sourcePdf":"20100016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05168S","chronDate":"13-15 April 2010","isNumber":"5552097","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547927","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5552131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5552142,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaqi Liang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5552140/5552142/5552142-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiaqi Liang (S\u201908) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2009.

A successful low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) scheme is a key requirement to achieve reliable and uninterrupted electrical power generation for wind turbines equipped with doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs). This paper proposes a feed-forward transient current control (FFTCC) scheme for the rotor side converter (RSC) of a DFIG to enhance its LVRT capability. This new control scheme introduces additional feed-forward transient compensations to a conventional current regulator. When three phase faults occur, these compensation terms correctly align the RSC ac-side output voltage with the transient-induced voltage, resulting in minimum transient rotor current and minimum occurrence of crowbar interruptions. With little additional computational effort, the proposed control scheme helps relieve the transient current stress on the RSC and helps maintain an uninterrupted active and reactive power supply from the wind turbines to the power grid. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FFTCC scheme in suppressing transient rotor currents.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feed-Forward Transient Current Control for Low-Voltage Ride-Through Enhancement of DFIG Wind Turbines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2010.2048033","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5552140/05552142.pdf","startPage":"836","endPage":"843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2010.2048033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Feed-Forward Transient Current Control for Low-Voltage Ride-Through Enhancement of DFIG Wind Turbines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5552142/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11476804","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feed-Forward Transient Current Control for Low-Voltage Ride-Through Enhancement of DFIG Wind Turbines","sourcePdf":"tec-liang-2048033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056252S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5552140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"165","xplore-issue":"5552140","articleId":"5552142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5552152,"authors":[{"name":"Duong Quoc Hung","affiliation":["Electricity of Vietnam, Ho chi Minh, Vietnam"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5552140/5552152/5552152-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Duong Quoc Hung received the M.Eng. degree in energy field of study (specialization on electric power system management) from Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand, in May 2008.","Since 1999, he has been with the Power Company No. 2, Electricity of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he is currently an Electrical Engineer in the Technical Department.

The rotor-side converter control and additional equipment, called stator damping resistor, are used to limit the rotor inrush current and to reduce the oscillations and settling time of DFIG transient response during the voltage dip. Also, the grid-side converter is controlled to limit the dc-link overvoltage during the voltage drop. It is found that the dynamics of the grid-side converter and dc-link voltage exhibit nonminimum phase behavior, and thus there is an inherent limitation on the achievable dynamic response during the fault. Since the dc-link dynamics is nonlinear, the linear control scheme cannot properly limit the dc-link voltage under large voltage dips. Thus, a nonlinear control scheme applied to the grid-side converter is proposed, which stabilizes the internal dynamics and limits the dc-link voltage fluctuations during the fault. The proposed ride-through approaches limit the peak values of rotor current and dc-link voltage at the instants of occurring and clearing the fault. They also limit the oscillations of electromagnetic torque, and consequently, improve the DFIG voltage dip behavior.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Control Approaches for Low-Voltage Ride-Through Enhancement in Wind Turbines With Doubly Fed Induction Generators","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2010.2050485","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5552140/05552157.pdf","startPage":"873","endPage":"883","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2010.2050485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Control Approaches for Low-Voltage Ride-Through Enhancement in Wind Turbines With Doubly Fed Induction Generators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5552157/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11476808","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Control Approaches for Low-Voltage Ride-Through Enhancement in Wind Turbines With Doubly Fed Induction Generators","sourcePdf":"tec-rahimi-2050485-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061551S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5552140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5552140","articleId":"5552157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5552184,"authors":[{"name":"Hwisung Jung","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5552176/5552184/5552184-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hwisung Jung (S'99) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 2009.","He is currently with Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA.

The motivation for utilizing supervised learning in the form of a Bayesian classifier is to reduce the overhead of the PM which has to repetitively determine and assign voltage-frequency settings for each processor core in the system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed supervised learning based power management technique ensures system-wide energy savings under rapidly and widely varying workloads.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2059270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5552176/05552184.pdf","startPage":"1395","endPage":"1408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2059270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised Learning Based Power Management for Multicore Processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Supervised Learning Based Power Management for Multicore Processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552184/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11477021","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552184/","volume":"29","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised Learning Based Power Management for Multicore Processors","sourcePdf":"tcad-jung-2059270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12965S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5552176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5552176","articleId":"5552184","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5552187,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungsu Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5552176/5552187/5552187-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyungsu Kang (S'06) received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2003.

However, traditional cooling methods, e.g., power/clock gating applied when a temperature threshold is reached, often cause excessive performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a method for delivering lower energy consumption by integrating the cooling and running in a temperature-aware manner without incurring performance penalty. In order to further reduce the energy consumption, we exploited the runtime distribution of each sub-segment of a task called \u201cbin\u201d in an analytical manner such that time budget for cooling in each bin is allocated in proportion to the probability of the occurrence of the bin. We apply the proposed method to two realistic software programs, H.264 decoder and ray tracing and a benchmark program, equake. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields additional 19.4%-27.2% reduction in energy consumption compared with existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11477015","htmlLink":"/document/5552187/","displayDocTitle":"Temperature-Aware Integrated DVFS and Power Gating for Executing Tasks With Runtime Distribution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature-Aware Integrated DVFS and Power Gating for Executing Tasks With Runtime Distribution","sourcePdf":"tcad-kang-2059290-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136359S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5552176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5552176","articleId":"5552187","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5552215,"authors":[{"name":"Alp Arslan Bayrakci","affiliation":["Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5552176/5552215/5552215-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alp Arslan Bayrakci received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2004.

We describe a transistor-level Monte Carlo (MC) technique which makes final transistor-level timing verification practically feasible. The MC method is used as a golden reference in assessing the accuracy of other timing yield estimation techniques. However, it is generally believed that it can not be used in practice as it requires too many costly transistor-level simulations. We present a novel approach to constructing an improved MC estimator for timing yield which provides the same accuracy as standard MC but at a cost of much fewer transistor-level simulations. This improved estimator is based on a unique combination of a variance reduction technique, importance sampling, and a cheap but approximate gate delay model. The results we present demonstrate that our improved yield estimator achieves the same accuracy as standard MC at a cost reduction reaching several orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2049042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2049042","startPage":"1328","endPage":"1341","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5552176/05552215.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Monte Carlo Estimation of Timing Yield With Importance Sampling and Transistor-Level Circuit Simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fast Monte Carlo Estimation of Timing Yield With Importance Sampling and Transistor-Level Circuit Simulation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","volume":"29","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552215/","accessionNumber":"11477012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552215/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Monte Carlo Estimation of Timing Yield With Importance Sampling and Transistor-Level Circuit Simulation","sourcePdf":"tcad-abayrakci-2049042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100478S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5552176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5552176","articleId":"5552215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":5552222,"authors":[{"name":"Cliff Chiung-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5552176/5552222/5552222-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cliff Chiung-Yu Lin received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in electronics engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently pursuing the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.","His current research interests include multiagent systems and machine learning."]},"firstName":"Cliff Chiung-Yu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37536574200"},{"name":"Yao-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5552176/5552222/5552222-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yao-Wen Chang (S'94\u2013A'96\u2013M'96) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan, in 1988, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Texas at Austin in 1993 and 1996, respectively, all in computer science.","He is a currently a Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Director of the Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, NTU.

To make the biochip feasible for practical applications, pin-count reduction is a key problem to higher-level integration of reactions on a biochip. Most previous works approach the problem by post-processing the placement and routing solutions to share compatible control signals; however, the quality of such sharing algorithms is inevitably limited by the placement and routing solutions. We present in this paper a comprehensive pin-constrained biochip design flow that addresses the pin-count issue at all design stages. The proposed flow consists of three major stages: 1) pin-count aware stage assignment that partitions the reactions in the given bioassay into execution stages; 2) pin-count aware device assignment that determines a specific device used for each reaction; and 3) guided placement, routing, and pin assignment that utilize the pin-count saving properties from the stage and device assignments to optimize the assay time and pin-count. For both the stage and device assignments, basic integer linear programming formulations and effective solution-space reduction schemes are proposed to minimize the assay time and pin-count. Experimental results show the efficiency of our methods and a 55-57% pin-count reduction over the state-of-the-art algorithms/flow.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2010.2049157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5552176/05552222.pdf","startPage":"1315","endPage":"1327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2010.2049157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ILP-Based Pin-Count Aware Design Methodology for Microfluidic Biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552222/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"ILP-Based Pin-Count Aware Design Methodology for Microfluidic Biochips","volume":"29","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11477011","htmlLink":"/document/5552222/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ILP-Based Pin-Count Aware Design Methodology for Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"tcad-ychang-2049157-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131044S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5552176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5552176","articleId":"5552222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5552226,"authors":[{"name":"Gennadi Bersuker","affiliation":["SEMATECH Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5552158/5552226/5552226-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gennadi Bersuker received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from Leningrad State University, St. Petersburg, and Kishinev State University, Kishinev, USSR, respectively.","After graduation, he joined the Academy of Sciences of Moldova and was then with Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands, and the University of Texas, Austin.

The proposed single-linking PCNN simplifies conventional PCNN and thus the related parameter can be adaptively selected and no iteration time needs to be determined, which a noisy image can be filtered by two times of firing process of the original image and the reversed image. The single linking PCNN first identifies noisy pixels and filters the noisy pixels by a median filter therefore the proposed method can filter impulse noise while keeping the fine information-bearing details. The proposed method can adaptively determine the filtering times based on the noise intensity. The method demonstrates better performance compared to conventional impulse noise filters when the noise intensity varies from 10%-60%.

However, the introduction of image and video sensors demands certain quality of service (QoS) from the routing protocols and underlying networks. Finding routing paths that satisfy different metrics of the QoS requirement is a NP-complete problem. In this paper, a quantum genetic algorithm based energy-aware QoS routing protocol (QG-QoS) is proposed for wireless sensor networks, which can run efficiently with best-effort traffic. To the best of our knowledge, QG-QoS is the first quantum genetic algorithm based QoS routing protocol in wireless sensor networks. Simulation results show that our approach is better than previous protocols for different metrics.","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2010.5552333","startPage":"37","endPage":"40","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/5546281/5552249/05552333.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2010.5552333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quantum genetic algorithm based QoS routing protocol for wireless sensor networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Wireless sensor networks","Routing","Routing protocols","Sensors","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","quality of service","routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum genetic algorithm","wireless sensor networks","image sensors","video sensors","quality of service","NP-complete problem","energy-aware QoS routing protocol","QG-QoS routing protocol","best-effort traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum genetic algorithm","QoS routing","Wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A quantum genetic algorithm based QoS routing protocol for wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552333/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11487714","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quantum genetic algorithm based QoS routing protocol for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"009dS039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048873S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5546281","isNumber":"5552249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5546281","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5552249","articleId":"5552333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":5552350,"authors":[{"name":"Hanim Ismail","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Hanim","lastName":"Ismail","id":"37531994100"},{"name":"Noraliza Hamzah","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Noraliza","lastName":"Hamzah","id":"38241291400"},{"name":"Sharani Shahbudin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Sharani","lastName":"Shahbudin","id":"37542978100"},{"name":"Zuhaina Zakaria","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zuhaina","lastName":"Zakaria","id":"37273041600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6055-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6054-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6053-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"5552350","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage fluctuations","Support vector machines","Wavelet transforms","Induction motors","Power quality","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimax techniques","power engineering computing","power supply quality","support vector machines","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comparative analysis","wavelet transform","voltage sag disturbance classification","power quality disturbance","power system fault","induction motor","power transformer","support vector machine","SVM method","wavelet energy level","wavelet min-max values","standard IEEE 30 bus distribution system","PSCAD software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voltage Sag","Support Vector Machine","Wavelet Transform"]}],"abstract":"Voltage sag is one of the major power quality disturbance today.

Wavelet transform is carried out to extract the feature of these voltage sags which are used as the input to the SVM. Two different types of inputs used, namely the energy level and the min-max values of the wavelet. Comparisons between these input parameters are made to determine the best method which give the best prediction values.

One of the promising approaches to 4G is adaptive OFDM (AOFDM). In AOFDM, adaptive transmission scheme is employed according to channel fading condition with OFDM to improve the performance Adaptive modulation system is superior to fixed modulation system since it changes modulation scheme according to channel fading condition. Performance of adaptive modulation system depends on decision making logic. Adaptive modulation systems using hardware decision making circuits are inefficient to decide or change modulation scheme according to given conditions. Using fuzzy logic in decision making interface makes the system more efficient. In this paper, we propose a OFDM system with adaptive modulation using fuzzy logic interface to improve system capacity with maintaining good error performance. The results of computer simulation show the improvement of system capacity in Rayleigh fading channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/5546281/5552249/05552368.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"371","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2010.5552368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2010.5552368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive modulation for OFDM system using fuzzy logic interface","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","OFDM","Adaptive systems","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Fuzzy logic","Adaptation model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","adaptive modulation","fuzzy logic","OFDM modulation","quality of service","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation system","fuzzy logic interface","high-quality service","next generation wireless communication systems","spectrum efficiency","error performance","4G communication","adaptive OFDM system","AOFDM system","adaptive transmission scheme","fixed modulation system","decision making logic","hardware decision making circuits","computer simulation","Rayleigh fading channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fuzzy logic","Adaptive modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive modulation for OFDM system using fuzzy logic interface","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552368/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11487619","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive modulation for OFDM system using fuzzy logic interface","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"089S188gdp.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057902S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5546281","isNumber":"5552249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5546281","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5552249","articleId":"5552368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5552379,"authors":[{"name":"Hu Feng","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Feng","id":"37397258000"},{"name":"Li Jianping","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jianping","id":"37411241000"},{"name":"Cai Chaoshi","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cai","lastName":"Chaoshi","id":"37541945000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6055-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6054-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6053-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"5552379","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Matrix decomposition","Estimation","Receiving antennas","Erbium","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","matrix algebra","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO Systems","semiblind orthogonal procrustes estimation","channel estimation technique","multiple-input multiple-output systems","Rayleigh flat-fading channels","channel matrix","QR factorization","Cholesky decomposition","down-triangular matrix","unitary matrix","conventional ML channel estimator","mean squared error improvement","MSE improvement","training sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["semi-blind channel estimation","MIMO","QR decomposition","Cholesky decomposition","Orthogonal Procrustes"]}],"abstract":"A novel semi-blind orthogonal procrustes based channel estimation technique is developed for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems operating in the presence over Rayleigh flat-fading channels.

Simulation results show that the variable iterative decoding scheme can reduce the meaningless iterations effectively without affecting the results of various mappings comparison.","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2010.5552398","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/5546281/5552249/05552398.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2010.5552398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A variable iterative decoding scheme for various mappings based on BICM-ID","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A variable iterative decoding scheme for various mappings based on BICM-ID","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487723","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552398/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552398/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A variable iterative decoding scheme for various mappings based on BICM-ID","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"044dS116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0914S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5546281","isNumber":"5552249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5546281","xplore-issue":"5552249","articleId":"5552398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5552422,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Wei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37287896500"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Li","id":"37538136400"},{"name":"Yongquan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Yongquan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406581800"},{"name":"Dongning Jia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Dongning","lastName":"Jia","id":"37411378400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6055-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6054-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6053-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"5552422","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":533},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Logic gates","Smart homes","Computer architecture","Cloud computing","Home appliances"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["home automation","Internet","internetworking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residential gateway architecture","cloud computing","smart home","home network","public network","household appliances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["residential gateway","Cloud Computing","Smart Home"]}],"abstract":"The residential gateway plays a significant role in a Smart Home, which connects the home network and the public network. There are various gateway architectures for the Smart Home. With the development of Cloud Computing, it is hoped that Smart Home can merge into the Clouds to provide more services and get more information provided by the Clouds. In this paper, we propose residential gateway architecture based on Cloud Computing. The residential gateway interconnects the household appliances and the Clouds. Our architecture is divided into four layers: physical layer, virtual devices layer, devices management layer and access Clouds layer. It is useful that the normal users can get benefit from the Clouds and it makes the Clouds extend the normal households. The architecture that we propose in this paper is a conceptual model and more work need to be done to implement it.","doi":"10.1109/ICSESS.2010.5552422","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Service Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/5546281/5552249/05552422.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSESS.2010.5552422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A residential gateway architecture based on Cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552422/","displayDocTitle":"A residential gateway architecture based on Cloud computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552422/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11487586","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A residential gateway architecture based on Cloud computing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"059dS140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04133S","chronDate":"16-18 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5546281","isNumber":"5552249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5546281","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5552249","articleId":"5552422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5552427,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Xiong","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37535096600"},{"name":"Zhou Wan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Engineering and Automation, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Wan","id":"37537484800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6055-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6054-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6053-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-0586"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-0594"}],"articleNumber":"5552427","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":650},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The simulation of double inverted pendulum control based on particle swarm optimization LQR algorithm","abstract":"The application of LQR controller in inverted pendulum system is common, but the choice of weight matrix Q and R of LQR controller has always been a difficult.

A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with multiple hidden layers is combined with the SSDNN framework to further enhance the accuracy and flexibility of the trained neural network models. In addition, a new formulation embedding finite delay elements into the existing SSDNN is proposed to effectively address the modeling of such I/O devices where a long propagation delay is present. The proposed method is applied to the behavioral modeling of a commercial SSTL output buffer. It is demonstrated that the proposed method provides better accuracy compared to the existing SSDNN for modeling I/O buffers with strong nonlinearity and a long propagation delay, while outperforming the detailed SPICE model in terms of simulation efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ANTEM.2010.5552487","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 14th International Symposium on Antenna Technology and Applied Electromagnetics & the American Electromagnetics Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTEM.2010.5552487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552356","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 14th International Symposium on Antenna Technology and Applied Electromagnetics & the American Electromagnetics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547542/5552356/05552487.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new generalized state-space dynamic neural network method for I/O buffer modeling in high-speed PCB design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552487/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new generalized state-space dynamic neural network method for I/O buffer modeling in high-speed PCB design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552487/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11487450","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new generalized state-space dynamic neural network method for I/O buffer modeling in high-speed PCB design","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"086Cao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071275S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547542","isNumber":"5552356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547542","xplore-issue":"5552356","articleId":"5552487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5552504,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One of the advantages of FEM-CSI is the ability to adaptively control the density of the triangular mesh within the inversion domain to increase the quality of the reconstructed image and to reduce the computational burden of the inversion algorithm. Here we present an example that exploits this advantage of FEM-CSI, providing a qualitative and quantitative analysis using several inversion results. The example selected is for an unbounded-region microwave tomography configuration under the 2D transverse magnetic (TM) approximation.","doi":"10.1109/ANTEM.2010.5552529","publicationTitle":"2010 14th International Symposium on Antenna Technology and Applied Electromagnetics & the American Electromagnetics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 14th International Symposium on Antenna Technology and Applied Electromagnetics & the American Electromagnetics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547542/5552356/05552529.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTEM.2010.5552529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of adaptive meshing in FEM-CSI for microwave tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552529/","displayDocTitle":"A study of adaptive meshing in FEM-CSI for microwave tomography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11477881","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552529/","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of adaptive meshing in FEM-CSI for microwave tomography","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"295Zakaria.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045739S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547542","isNumber":"5552356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547542","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5552356","articleId":"5552529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5552536,"authors":[{"name":"Greg Barrie","affiliation":["Defence Research & Development Canada (DRDC), Radar Applications and Space Technologies, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Barrie","id":"37545876500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5049-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5050-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5552536","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Ray tracing","Wireless communication","Dielectrics","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","radar computing","ray tracing","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray-tracing software","through-wall sensing application","synthetic aperture radar","finite-difference time-domain algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","geometric optics (GO)","ray-tracing","through-wall sensing (TWS)","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)"]}],"abstract":"This paper analyzes the suitability of commercially-available propagation software to model large scale through-wall synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenarios via ray-tracing.

Traditionally, the analysis of social networks has focused only on a single snapshot of a network. Researchers have already verified that social networks follow power-law degree distribution, have a small diameter, and exhibit small-world structure and community structure. Attempts to explain the properties of social networks have led to dynamic models inspired by the preferential attachment models which assumes that new network nodes have a higher probability of forming links with high-degree nodes, creating a rich-get-richer effect. Although some effort has been devoted to analyzing global properties of social network evolution, not much has been done to study graph evolution at a microscopic level. A first step in this direction investigated a variety of network formation strategies, showing that edge locality plays a critical role in network evolution. We propose a different approach. Following the paradigm of association rules and frequent-pattern mining, our work searches for typical patterns of structural changes in dynamic networks. Mining for such local patterns is a computationally challenging task that can provide further insight into the increasing amount of evolving network data. Beyond the notion of graph evolution rules (GERs), a concept that we introduced in an earlier work, we developed the Graph Evolution Rule Miner (GERM) software to extract such rules and applied these rules to predict future network evolution.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems","startPage":"26","endPage":"35","doi":"10.1109/MIS.2010.91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIS.2010.91","pdfPath":"/iel5/9670/5552580/05552587.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning and Predicting the Evolution of Social Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552587/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Learning and Predicting the Evolution of Social Networks","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11476888","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5552587/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning and Predicting the Evolution of Social Networks","sourcePdf":"mex2010040026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072288S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9670","isNumber":"5552580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9670","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5552580","articleId":"5552587","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5552591,"authors":[{"name":"Fei-Yue Wang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, China"],"bio":{"p":["Fei-Yue Wang is the vice president for research, education, and academic exchange at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the editor in chief of IEEE Intelligent Systems.

This paper adopts the concept of insurance and establishes a framework and the supporting reference model for cloud computing. We utilize the value-at-risk (VAR) approach to establish several appropriate mechanisms, and use a set of measurable metrics. Those quantitative or qualitative metrics can be applied as the basis for the business value and risk assessment, and eventually for insurance premium and compensation calculation for the failures of the services offered in Cloud environment. This model can also establish a potential new innovative market branch for the insurance industry.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552632/5552704/05552738.pdf","startPage":"584","endPage":"591","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2010.113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2010.113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Insuanrance Model for Guranteeing Service Assurance, Integrity and QoS in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Security","Insurance","Clouds","Risk management","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insurance","quality of service","software architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service insurance model","service assurance guranteeing","cloud computing","value-at-risk approach","quality of service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Security","Privacy","Integrity","Analytics","Quality of Service (QoS)","Service Risks","Service Assessment and Valuation","Service Insurance Model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Insuanrance Model for Guranteeing Service Assurance, Integrity and QoS in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552738/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11488358","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Insuanrance Model for Guranteeing Service Assurance, Integrity and QoS in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4128a584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049449S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552632","isNumber":"5552704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552632","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5552704","articleId":"5552738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5552792,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid Elgazzar","affiliation":["School of Computing, Queen's University, Canada"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Elgazzar","id":"37545863900"},{"name":"Ahmed E.

Users query the Internet for a required Web service and get back a set of Web services that may or may not satisfy their request. To get the most relevant Web services that fulfill the user's request, the user has to construct the request using the keywords that best describe the user's objective and match correctly with the Web Service name or location. Clustering Web services based on function similarities would greatly boost the ability of Web services search engines to retrieve the most relevant Web services.

The application of our approach to real Web services description files has shown good performance for clustering Web services based on function similarity, as a predecessor step to retrieving the relevant Web services for a user request by search engines.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2010.31","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552632/5552704/05552792.pdf","startPage":"147","endPage":"154","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2010.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering WSDL Documents to Bootstrap the Discovery of Web Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Clustering WSDL Documents to Bootstrap the Discovery of Web Services","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11488412","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5552792/","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering WSDL Documents to Bootstrap the Discovery of Web Services","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4128a147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087764S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552632","isNumber":"5552704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552632","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"5552704","articleId":"5552792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-05"},{"_id":5552797,"authors":[{"name":"Yilei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yilei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538317100"},{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Michael R.

Finding desired Web services is becoming an emergent and challenging research problem. In this paper, we present WSExpress (Web Service Express), a novel Web service search engine to expressively find expected Web services. WSExpress ranks the publicly available Web services not only by functional similarities to users' queries, but also by nonfunctional QoS characteristics of Web services. WSExpress provides three searching styles, which can adapt to the scenario of finding an appropriate Web service and the scenario of automatically replacing a failed Web service with a suitable one. WSExpress is implemented by Java language and large-scale experiments employing real-world Web services are conducted. Totally 3,738 Web services (15,811 operations) from 69 countries are involved in our experiments. The experimental results show that our search engine can find Web services with the desired functional and non-functional requirements. Extensive experimental studies are also conducted on a well known benchmark dataset consisting of 1,000 Web service operations to show the recall and precision performance of our search engine.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WSExpress: A QoS-aware Search Engine for Web Services","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2010.20","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552632/5552704/05552797.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2010.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"WSExpress: A QoS-aware Search Engine for Web Services","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552797/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11488417","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WSExpress: A QoS-aware Search Engine for Web Services","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4128a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071333S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552632","isNumber":"5552704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552632","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5552704","articleId":"5552797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5552800,"authors":[{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Yilei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yilei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538317100"},{"name":"Michael R.

Although QoS of Web services has been investigated in a lot of previous works, there is a lack of real-world Web service QoS datasets for validating new QoS based techniques and models of Web services. To study the performance of real-world Web services as well as provide reusable research datasets for promoting the research of QoS-driven Web services, we conduct several large-scale evaluations on real-world Web services. Firstly, addresses of 21,358 Web services are obtained from the Internet. Then, invocation failure probability performance of 150 Web services is assessed by 100 distributed service users. After that, response time and throughput performance of 5,825 Web services are evaluated by 339 distributed service users. Detailed experimental results are presented in this paper and comprehensive Web service QoS datasets are publicly released for future research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5552800/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11488420","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5552800/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed QoS Evaluation for Real-World Web Services","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed QoS Evaluation for Real-World Web Services","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4128a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059266S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5552632","isNumber":"5552704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5552632","citationCount":"213","xplore-issue":"5552704","articleId":"5552800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":5552803,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jiang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37533163200"},{"name":"Charles Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37307150700"},{"name":"Zhenqiu Huang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhenqiu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37534234500"},{"name":"Mingwen Chen","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Mingwen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539628100"},{"name":"Songlin Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Songlin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37534780500"},{"name":"Zhiyong Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289197400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8146-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4128-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5552803","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":511},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5552803","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Web services","Search problems","Time factors","Indexes","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QSynth","QoS-aware automatic service composition","Web services","service engineers","quality requirements","QoS objectives","service requests","search directives","search space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Service Composition","QoS-Aware","Dependency Graph"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2010.38","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5552632/5552704/05552803.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2010.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QSynth: A Tool for QoS-aware Automatic Service Composition","abstract":"With the proliferation of Web services, service engineers demand good automatic service composition algorithms that not only synthesize the correct work plans from thousands of services but also satisfy the quality requirements of the users.

This approach effectively prunes the search space and significantly improves the accuracy of the search results.

Different from other approaches, this method employs the characteristics of QoS by building an efficient region model. Based on this model, web service recommendations will be generated quickly by using modified memory-based collaborative filtering algorithm.

In the proposed approach, each of predictors is firstly constructed by training on a set of samples produced by bootstrapping using neural networks. Secondly, to improve the forecast capability of the bagging method, the constraint conditions are set to select competitive predictors. Finally, with the appropriate predictors, ensemble paradigm is applied to forecast stock prices. During the process, the network architectures of neural networks are discussed, and the optimal network architecture and proper parameters of the proposed model are determined by grid search method. To validate the proposed method, Dow Jones Index (DJI) is used for evaluation. The results show that constraint bagging outperforms traditional bagging and neural network predictor.

In this paper, we first proposed a novel methodology for measuring the difference between two mixture Gaussian distributions. Based on the derived formula, a Generalized Probabilistic Decision-Based Neural Network (GPDNN) is then proposed and implemented to realize the difference measurement method. By constructing a two layered pyramid-type network structure, the proposed GPDNN receives data in distributional form via 2-D grid input nodes, and outputs the classification and/or retrieval results from the top layer node. Forty texture images are selected from the MIT Vision Texture (VisTex) database to evaluate the proposed GPDNN for the texture classification and retrieval. Experimental results show that (1) by using the proposed difference measurement methods, the texture pattern retrieval rates can be improved from 77% to 82%, compared with some published leading methods, and (2) the proposed GPDNN shows significant texture classification and retrieval performance, which are about 90:1% and 88:6% of the accuracy, and much better than the traditional methods, i.e., 82.2% and 79.9%, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5553512/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11488592","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5553512/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"17-19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Generalized Probabilistic Decision-Based Neural Networks for texture classification and retrieval","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Probabilistic Decision-Based Neural Networks for texture classification and retrieval","confLoc":"Okayama, Japan","sourcePdf":"SunA0501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045257S","chronDate":"17-19 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547545","isNumber":"5553451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547545","xplore-issue":"5553451","articleId":"5553512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Pacilantic International Ltd","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5553597,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshihiro Yamamoto","affiliation":["Department of Information and Knowledge Engineering, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiro","lastName":"Yamamoto","id":"37292229400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9555293-3-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8381-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5553597","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5553597","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","discrete time systems","least squares approximations","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trigonometric polynomial neural network","fourier analysis","recursive least squares method","linear parameter estimation","learning algorithm","nonlinear discrete time systems"]}],"pdfPath":"/iel5/5547545/5553451/05553597.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 2010 International Conference on Modelling, Identification and Control","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of nonlinear systems using a Trigonometric Polynomial Neural Network","abstract":"A Trigonometric Polynomial Neural Network, called TPNN, is proposed in this paper.

Four benchmark test functions ZDT1~ZDT4 were used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. Performance comparison between MOPSO and other typical algorithms has been conducted. The simulation results of the standard IEEE-30-bus power system indicated that MOPSO is a good choice of power system reactive power optimization. The results show that MOPSO can provide the clear relation between active power loss and voltage deviation, and it is able to offer diverse solutions for different conditions. The stability of MOPSO has been confirmed through superposing many solutions together.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553760","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05553760.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-objective optimization method for power system reactive power dispatch","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Reactive power","Particle swarm optimization","Sorting","Heuristic algorithms","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pareto optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","reactive power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-objective optimization","power system reactive power dispatch","active power loss","voltage deviation","multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm","MOPSO","Pareto solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reactive power optimization","multi-objective optimization","non-dominated sorting","crowding distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5553760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A multi-objective optimization method for power system reactive power dispatch","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5553760/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11511735","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-objective optimization method for power system reactive power dispatch","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"0002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.117218S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5553760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5553761,"authors":[{"name":"Kongcun Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Kongcun Zhu","id":"37536118900"},{"name":"Mingyan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Mingyan Jiang","id":"37270835500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5553761","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Marine animals","Quantum computing","Convergence","Logic gates","Particle swarm optimization","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","Hilbert spaces","particle swarm optimisation","quantum gates","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum artificial fish swarm algorithm","global search ability","convergence speed","quantum computing","qubits polar coordinate representation","2-dimension Hilbert space","quantum rotation gate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AFSA","QAFSA","quantum computing","quantum rotation gate","quantum non-gate"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve the global search ability and the convergence speed of the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), a novel Quantum Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (QAFSA) which is based on the concepts and principles of quantum computing, such as the quantum bit and quantum gate is proposed in this paper.

The quantum rotation gate is used to update the position of the AF in order to enable the AF to move and the quantum non-gate is employed to realize the mutation of the AF for the purpose of speeding up the convergence.

The core of this modeling approach is that multi-moving-window concept is incorporated in combination with auto-associative neural network (AANN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The integrated neural network model is developed with different moving windows for process inputs, AANN for data compression and GRNN for model prediction, which can effectively capture the changing process dynamics, reduce the data dimension and reveal the nonlinear relationship between process variables and final output. For comparison, single-moving-window with AANN and GRNN (SMWNN), none-moving-window with AANN and GRNN (NMWNN) are also established for process modeling. Through the actual application in PTA solvent system of a chemical plant, the predicted results show that the proposed MMWNN is supervior to other neural networks with smaller prediction error that is more consistent with actual process. It is considered that MMWNN modeling could provide a useful guideline to explore the complicated dynamics of industry process.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553789","startPage":"4074","endPage":"4077","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05553789.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-moving-window neural network for modeling of purified terephthalic acid solvent system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5553789/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-moving-window neural network for modeling of purified terephthalic acid solvent system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5553789/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11511805","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-moving-window neural network for modeling of purified terephthalic acid solvent system","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"0759.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059629S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5553789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5553833,"authors":[{"name":"Cao Shengxian","affiliation":["Automation Engineering College, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Cao Shengxian","id":"37087660545"},{"name":"Du Bangkui","affiliation":["Automation Engineering College, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Du Bangkui","id":"37542532300"},{"name":"Sun Jiawei","affiliation":["Automation Engineering College, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Sun Jiawei","id":"37088013589"},{"name":"Liu Fan","affiliation":["Automation Engineering College, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Liu Fan","id":"37087364490"},{"name":"Yang Shanrang","affiliation":["Automation Engineering College, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Yang Shanrang","id":"37087664296"},{"name":"Xu Zhiming","affiliation":["Automation Engineering College, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"lastName":"Xu Zhiming","id":"37087360714"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5553833","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5553833","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Light sources","Artificial neural networks","Current measurement","Training","Lighting","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","image colour analysis","light sources","lighting","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image vision","light source fluctuations","image color constancy algorithm","BP neural network","illumination intensity","nonlinear mapping","polychromatic standard light source","image color analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["color constancy","standard light source","neural networks","color correction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553833","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05553833.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","startPage":"3100","endPage":"3103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A colour constancy algorithm based on neural network and application","abstract":"Obtaining color constancy is the study focuses in the field of image vision which does not alter with light source illumination modification.

The speed of calculation is fast and the error is small for this algorithm. And this algorithm is applied to the hardness online measurement based on the image color.

In this structure, market participants must develop their bids in order to maximize their profits. Building optimal bidding strategies for GENCO could need to evaluate some market parameters such as forecasting market-clearing price (MCP), non-convex production cost function and forecasting load. A new framework to build bidding strategies for GENCO in an electricity market is presented in this paper. A normal probability distribution function (PDF) is used to describe the bidding behaviors of other competing generators. Bidding strategy of a generator for each trading period in a day-ahead market is solved by a new adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO). APSO can dynamically follow the frequently changing market demand and supply in each trading interval. A numerical example serves to illustrate the essential features of the approach and the results are compared with the solutions by other PSO algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553841","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05553841.pdf","startPage":"3207","endPage":"3210","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bidding strategy based on adaptive particle swarm optimization for electricity market","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5553841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Bidding strategy based on adaptive particle swarm optimization for electricity market","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11511861","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5553841/","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bidding strategy based on adaptive particle swarm optimization for electricity market","confLoc":"Jinan","sourcePdf":"0590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067041S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5553841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5553848,"authors":[{"name":"Huiyuan Wang","affiliation":["IEETA, Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal","School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Huiyuan Wang","id":"37292561600"},{"name":"J Vieira","affiliation":["IEETA, Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"J","lastName":"Vieira","id":"38548025200"},{"name":"B Jesus","affiliation":["IEETA, Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"B","lastName":"Jesus","id":"37271921200"},{"name":"Isabel Duarte","affiliation":["IEETA, Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Isabel","lastName":"Duarte","id":"37542509100"},{"name":"Paulo Ferreira","affiliation":["IEETA, Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"37280287200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5553848","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"abstract":"The basic theories of compressed sensing (CS) turn around the sampling and reconstruction of 1-D signals. To deal with 2-D signals (images), the conventional treatment is to convert them into1-D vectors. This has drawbacks, including huge memory demands and difficulties in the design and calibration of the optical imaging systems. As a result, in 2009 some researchers proposed the concept of compressed imaging (CI) with separable sensing operators. However, their work is only focused on the sampling phase. In this paper, we propose a scheme for 2-D CS that is memory- and computation-efficient in both sampling and reconstruction. This is achieved by decomposing the 2-D CS problem into two stages with the help of an intermediate image. The intermediate image is then solved by direct orthogonal linear transform and the original image is reconstructed by solving a set of 1-D l1-norm minimization sub-problems. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05553848.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"43","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5553848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel memory-efficient fast algorithm for 2-D compressed sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Minimization","Wavelet transforms","Imaging","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image sampling","optical images","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory-efficient fast algorithm","2-D compressed sensing","1-D signal sampling","1-D signal reconstruction","optical imaging system","2-D CS problem","orthogonal linear transform","image reconstruction","1-D 11-norm minimization subproblem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","2-D transform","Imaging","sampling","reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5553848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel memory-efficient fast algorithm for 2-D compressed sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5553848/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11511864","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel memory-efficient fast algorithm for 2-D compressed sensing","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"0009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057072S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5553848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5553873,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Bin Hu","id":"37087069092"},{"name":"Zhengshun Fei","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Zhengshun Fei","id":"37087516738"},{"name":"Zhao Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Zhao","id":"37088055327"},{"name":"Jun Liang","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Control, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Jun Liang","id":"37087142431"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5553873","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5553873","abstract":"A novel multi-loop nonlinear Internal Model Control (IMC) strategy is developed for MIMO systems under the Partial Least Squares (PLS) framework, which automatically decomposes the MIMO process into several univariate systems in the latent space.

The cascaded mode of ARX-neural network model facilitates the parameters estimation in the process identification, as well as nonlinear IMC design. With perfect modeling, the nonlinear closed-loop system can be reduced to IMC robust filter with a system pure delay factor under the proposed nonlinear IMC scheme. By tuning the IMC filter, the robust property of the control system is adjusted to account for the model-plant mismatch, and the offset free performance is obtained through perfectly inverting the steady-state gain of the model.

However, compared to other traditional orthogonal transforms, such as DFT and DCT. The usually used fast wavelet transform (FWT) has its inconvenience in application. One frequently met problem is that FWT is rarely realized in the form of linear transformation by matrix and vector multiplication, which is the form that almost all the other existing orthogonal transforms take. That is because FWT dose not usually have an explicit transform matrix. As a result, FWT cannot be used in some cases where an explicit transform matrix is required. In this paper, we explore the matrix forms of 2-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and apply one of them in compressed sensing (CS). Our contribution is in two aspects: we give the equivalent 2-D DWT matrix that can be used to perform the 2-D DWT in the matrix form of 1-D DWT; meanwhile, we propose a separable 2-D DWT that is different from the traditional one and has some good properties.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553961","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05553961.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5553961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","startPage":"35","endPage":"39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-D wavelet transforms in the form of matrices and application in compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5553961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"2-D wavelet transforms in the form of matrices and application in compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5553961/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11512105","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5553961/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-D wavelet transforms in the form of matrices and application in compressed sensing","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"0008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055516S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5553961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5553966,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538302700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5553966","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Sensors","Petroleum","Training","Data models","Artificial neural networks","Input variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fluidisation","fuzzy logic","fuzzy neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["T-S fuzzy neural network","system identification","soft sensing process","chemical industry","error model","fuzzy logic system","soft sensing system","fluidized catalytic cracking unit system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Soft sensing","system identification","T-S fuzzy neural network","FCCU"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5553966","abstract":"In order to obtain a better result, a better method of system identification should be adopted in soft sensing process of chemical industry.

The applicability of the proposed methods can be demonstrated by one numerical example with simulations.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554059","startPage":"734","endPage":"739","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05554059.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization control for an array of coupled neural networks with time-varying delay coupling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Chaos","Arrays","Delay","Couplings","Artificial neural networks","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic communication","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov matrix equations","neurocontrollers","synchronisation","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronization control","coupled neural networks","time-varying delay coupling","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional technique","Kronecker product technique","linear matrix inequalities","integral inequality","convex combination","delay derivative","Matlab LMI toolbox","matrix parameters","addressed coupled systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupled neural networks","Synchronization","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","Time-varying delay","LMI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5554059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization control for an array of coupled neural networks with time-varying delay coupling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5554059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11512329","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization control for an array of coupled neural networks with time-varying delay coupling","confLoc":"Jinan","sourcePdf":"0133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063125S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5554059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5554068,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information & Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37959364200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5554068","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Programming","Algorithm design and analysis","Correlation","Evolutionary computation","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","job shop scheduling","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks ensemble","job shop schedule problem","evolutionary programming","negative correlation learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural networks ensemble","evolutionary programming","correlation learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5554068","abstract":"A evolutionary programming is proposed in this paper to automatically design neural networks(NNS) ensembles.

The 9-ary tree algorithm can be further extended to estimate the correct value of the faulty transducers while the SSE is less than threshold.

The Fourier spectrum of complex Morlet wavelet is real, which the Fourier spectrum has no complex phase, the complex Morlet wavelet does not affect the phase of a signal in complex domain. This gives a desirable ability to detect the singularity characteristic of a signal precisely. In this study, the complex Morlet wavelet amplitude and phase map are used in conjunction to detect and diagnose the bearing fault.

By calculating the affecting factors of the design variables to objective functions and fuzzy clustering, the design variables are divided into different strategic spaces owned by each player. Then it uses Nash equilibrium game model, coalition cooperative game model and evolutionary game model to solve multi-objective optimization design problem and gives corresponding solving steps. According to the specific game model, a mapping relationship between the game players' payoff and the objective functions is proposed. Each player takes payoff function of its own as its objective and undertakes single-objective optimization in its own strategy space. Then this player obtains the best strategy versus other players. The best strategies of all players consist of the strategy permutation of a round game and it obtains the final game solutions through multi-round games according to the convergence criterion. Taking two objectives design of four bar joist rack structures for example, the results show that the computational precision of the coalition cooperative game model is the best ,which illustrates that cooperative game has the advantages over non-cooperative game in fulfilling polytropic win-win and collective benefit; while the coalition cooperative game model is the worst from the computational efficiency view, which shows that cooperation spends more time negotiating so as to obtain win-win; considering these factors comprehensively , evolutionary game model is better at computational precision and efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5554307/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11511766","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5554307/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization design methods based on game theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization design methods based on game theory","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"0402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068005S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5554307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5554320,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi''an University of Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Ding Liu","id":"37087191285"},{"name":"Junli Liang","affiliation":["School of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi''an University of Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Junli Liang","id":"37087194146"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5554320","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":560},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Azimuth","Signal to noise ratio","Sensor arrays","Direction of arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["L-shaped array","2-D DOA estimation","parallel factor analysis","directions-of-arrival","second-order statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","Directions-of-arrival"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5554320","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05554320.pdf","startPage":"6949","endPage":"6952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"L-shaped array-based 2-D DOA estimation using parallel factor analysis","abstract":"For two-dimensional (2-D) directions-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problem, the L-shaped array seems to have higher accuracy than other structured arrays (see [3] for details), and has received much attention. Many algorithms firstly estimate two electric angles separately using the two orthogonal subarrays of the L-shaped array, and then obtain elevation and azimuth angles from these two correctly matched electric angles. However, the failure in pairing will cause severe performance degradation. To avoid the performance degradation resulted from wrong pairing, a parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis model-based algorithm is proposed in this paper to estimate 2-D DOA in the L-shaped array geometry without pairing parameters. The key points of this paper are: i) Dividing the whole L-shaped array into several subarrays, and constructing several matrices using the second-order statistics of some properly chosen array outputs to alleviate the noise effect and thus improve estimation accuracy; and ii) Forming a PARAFAC analysis model to avoid the performance degradation resulted from wrong pairing.

It is capable of dynamically controlling a group of mobile robots to achieve different task locations from arbitrary initial locations and directions. In the proposed approach, the robot motion planning is integrated with the task assignment, thus the robots start to move once the overall task is given. The group of mobile robots can automatically arrange the total task, and dynamically adjust their motion whenever the environment is changed, such as when some robots break down, some robots and/or some tasks are added, or the situation accruing when some tasks are changed. Different from our early study, the current direction of every robot is considered during the robot motion planning. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated by simulation studies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05554341.pdf","startPage":"2168","endPage":"2173","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5554341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved SOM-based approach to dynamic task assignment of multi-robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Mobile communication","Indexes","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","multi-robot systems","path planning","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SOM-based approach","dynamic task assignment problem","multirobot system","self organizing map","mobile robot","robot motion planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Task assignment","self-organizing map","multi-robots","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5554341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"An improved SOM-based approach to dynamic task assignment of multi-robots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5554341/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11511893","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved SOM-based approach to dynamic task assignment of multi-robots","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"0393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072232S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5554341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5554380,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenhai Wang","affiliation":["School of Information, Linyi Normal University, Linyi, China"],"lastName":"Zhenhai Wang","id":"37537358600"},{"name":"Xiaodong Li","affiliation":["School of Information, Linyi Normal University, Linyi, China"],"lastName":"Xiaodong Li","id":"37539502700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5554380","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"abstract":"A face recognition method based on improved principal components analysis (PCA) reconstruction is proposed.

Finally, the stable and validate GaNPA model is achieved through comprehensively surveying phase and gain characteristics, and convergence of parameter estimation by numerical simulation.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554774","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05554774.pdf","startPage":"5742","endPage":"5745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification for the GaN amplifier in OFDM communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5554774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5554774/","displayDocTitle":"Identification for the GaN amplifier in OFDM communication system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11511335","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5554774/","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification for the GaN amplifier in OFDM communication system","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"1091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044471S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5554774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5554812,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiping Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology for Opto-Electronics Information, Yantai University, Yantai, China","Institute of Science and Technology for Opto-Electronics Information, Yantai University, Dresden, Germany"],"lastName":"Ruiping Chen","id":"37535332900"},{"name":"Dong Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology for Opto-Electronics Information, Yantai University, Yantai, China","Institute of Science and Technology for Opto-Electronics Information, Yantai University, Dresden, Germany"],"lastName":"Dong Guo","id":"37532173600"},{"name":"Zhongxun","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology for Opto-Electronics Information, Yantai University, Yantai, China","Institute of Science and Technology for Opto-Electronics Information, Yantai University, Dresden, Germany"],"lastName":"Zhongxun","id":"37659688700"},{"name":"Xingchen","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology for Opto-Electronics Information, Yantai University, 264005, China"],"lastName":"Xingchen"},{"name":"Xinqiao Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology for Opto-Electronics Information, Yantai University, Yantai, China","Institute of Science and Technology for Opto-Electronics Information, Yantai University, Dresden, Germany"],"lastName":"Xinqiao Yu","id":"37539449400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5554812","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of 2-state trellis LDPC code in OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5554812","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","OFDM modulation","parity check codes","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis LDPC code","OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technology","encoding methods","decoding methods","two-state trellis decoding algorithm","OFDM base-band transmission system","parallel encoding","parallel decoding","mobile communication system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","trellis deevising"]}],"abstract":"In this paper orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology with the encoding and decoding methods of LDPC code are introduced, a novel two-state trellis decoding algorithm is presented.

It should be pointed out that this domain is very important for designing the neural network structure, for example, it directly determines the choice of the centers of radial basis function neural networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5554919/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11511474","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5554919/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Globally stable adaptive tracking control using RBF neural networks as feedforward compensator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Globally stable adaptive tracking control using RBF neural networks as feedforward compensator","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"0194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090984S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5554919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5554930,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Kai","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Biomass Power Generation Equipment, School of Energy and Power Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zheng Kai","id":"37087270269"},{"name":"Dong Xinghui","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Biomass Power Generation Equipment, School of Energy and Power Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dong Xinghui","id":"37088157670"},{"name":"Wang Dongsheng","affiliation":["National Engineering Laboratory for Biomass Power Generation Equipment, School of Energy and Power Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wang Dongsheng","id":"37087755132"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5554930","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Vibration control","Vibrations","Actuators","Biological cells","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","genetic algorithms","intelligent control","supports","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent vibration control","piezoelectric truss structure","genetic algorithm","adaptive truss structure","self-learning active vibration control system","fuzzy neural network controller","adaptive membership function","two-bay truss structure","vibration suppression","accelerometer","control command signal","inference mechanism","truss vibration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive truss structure","Vibration control","Fuzzy neural network(FNN)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5554930","abstract":"This paper presents design, implementation and experimental results of active vibration control of adaptive truss structure using fuzzy neural method.

The experimental setup of a two-bay truss structure with active members is constructed, and the FNN controller is applied to vibration suppression of the truss. The controller first senses the output of the accelerometer as an error to activate the adaptation of the weights of the controller, and then a control command signal is calculated based on the FNN inference mechanism to drive the active members.

Compared with pedestrian detection, this new problem is more challenging because various appearance and motion of bicycles increase the diversity of the detection objects; therefore existing pedestrian detection approaches can hardly get good overall performance because cyclist detection requires more information represented by more effective features to enable detection. For general object detection and pedestrian detection, histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features achieved great success; however it have two major drawbacks: time-consuming caused by dense/overlap sampling and only local information is retained. In this paper, we proposed a more effective feature extraction method (i.e., HOG-LP) to overcome the drawbacks of general HOG feature extraction for crossing cyclist detection. On one hand, an improved light/non-overlap sampling method is proposed to speed up HOG feature extraction; on the other hand, pyramid sampling is utilized to extract additional global features in different scale spaces in order to retain more information for high classification accuracy. With efficient feature extraction, a linear SVM classifier is used to further increase the detection speed. The experimental results tested on urban traffic videos show the effectiveness of the proposed method on crossing cyclist detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5554979/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11511179","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5554979/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An effective crossing cyclist detection on a moving vehicle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective crossing cyclist detection on a moving vehicle","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"0068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034685S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5554979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5554989,"authors":[{"name":"Fengjun Hu","affiliation":["Modern Education Technology center, Zhejiang ShuRen University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Fengjun Hu","id":"37087669755"},{"name":"Fan Wu","affiliation":["Modern Education Technology center, Zhejiang ShuRen University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Fan Wu","id":"37087450826"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5554989","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5554989","abstract":"To improve the performance of particle swarm optimization and differential evolution, the diploid differential evolution particle swarm optimization was presented according to the genetics rules.

A real number encoding method was presented and some heuristics were modified and improved the solution. The parameters of algorithm were analyzed in the experiment. And comparison with other algorithms in the literatures showed the proposed algorithm was effective.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554989","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2697","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05554989.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5554989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diploid hybrid Particle swarm optimization with differential evolution for Open Vehicle Routing Problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Vehicles","Optimization","Chromium","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Evolution (biology)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","transportation","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diploid hybrid particle swarm optimization","differential evolution","open vehicle routing problem","genetics rule","dominant character","recessive character","real number encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Differential Evolution","OVRP","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5554989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Diploid hybrid Particle swarm optimization with differential evolution for Open Vehicle Routing Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5554989/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11511192","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diploid hybrid Particle swarm optimization with differential evolution for Open Vehicle Routing Problem","confLoc":"Jinan","sourcePdf":"0493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063744S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5554989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5555039,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Pang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Lu Pang","id":"37530918400"},{"name":"Mingyan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"lastName":"Mingyan Jiang","id":"37270835500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555039","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","MIMO","Schedules","Array signal processing","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","broadcast channels","diversity reception","intercarrier interference","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicell MIMO scenarios","sum rate capacity","orthogonal random beamforming","multiple-antenna broadcast channels","multiuser diversity","multicell interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal Random Beamforming (ORB)","multi-cell interference","single-cell","multi-user diversity (MUD)","fairness"]}],"abstract":"In multiple-antenna broadcast channels, orthogonal random beamforming (ORB) constitutes an effective mean to exploit multi-user diversity (MUD) for its inherent opportunistic attribute. However, most of recent papers just consider the single-cell hypothesis in which case multi-cell interference is completely neglected. In order to conform to the wireless environment in reality, a multi-cell model employing ORB scheme is proposed in this paper. Based on the nonquantized signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) feedback model, a closed-form expression of theory limit for sum rate capacity is proposed. The theory limit of single-cell model is proved to be a special case of our proposed model. Furthermore, the fairness of our model in interference limited system can be improved distinctly than that of single-cell model, at the decreasing cost of sum rate capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed model has more rationality and generality compared with single-cell model.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2010.5555039","publicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 8th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535248/5553742/05555039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2010.5555039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5553742","startPage":"1440","endPage":"1443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum rate capacity for orthogonal random beamforming in multi-cell MIMO scenarios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sum rate capacity for orthogonal random beamforming in multi-cell MIMO scenarios","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555039/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11511228","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555039/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum rate capacity for orthogonal random beamforming in multi-cell MIMO scenarios","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"0263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107062S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535248","isNumber":"5553742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535248","xplore-issue":"5553742","articleId":"5555039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555041,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Yu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Wei Yu","id":"37538110500"},{"name":"Zhiming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science, Huizhou University, Huizhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Zhiming Chen","id":"37536701100"},{"name":"Fei Luo","affiliation":["Department of Automation, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Luo","id":"37274589700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6712-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6711-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555041","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Economic indicators","Mathematical model","Support vector machines","Predictive models","Forecasting","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","economic forecasting","economic indicators","genetic algorithms","least squares approximations","neural nets","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic genetic algorithm","LS-SVM method","least square support machine model","economic forecasting","economic indicators","chaotic search algorithm","BP neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["economic forecasting","support vector machines","genetic algorithm","chaotic optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555041","abstract":"Accurate forecasting of some economic indicators such as GDP is very useful.

A tapped-delay line filter model with time-varying coefficients is used to model the channel. The taps represent signals with delay corresponding to their relative propagation time. Each delayed signal is modulated in amplitude and phase by independent baseband random functions of time that produces Rayleigh fading. Doppler frequency shift is also incorporated in the channel model. Channel characteristics are analyzed in terms of power delay profile, Doppler frequency shift and burst error occurrence probability. Finally, BER performance of the channel is analyzed using computer simulation and effect of interleaving and error correcting code on the performance is observed.","doi":"10.1109/SIBIRCON.2010.5555104","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering

RF steerable beamforming networks based on butler matrix and rotman lens for ITS applications","abstract":"This paper presents the design, simulation, and fabrication of two RF steerable beamforming networks (BFN) using a 4\u00d74 Butler Matrix for the 3.15 GHz (S-band) and an 8\u00d78 Rotman Lens for the 6.3 GHz (C-band). Both beamforming networks are intended for the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Although the frequency range likely to be allocated to such systems is 63 GHz, where the short transmission range allows multiple frequency reuse, both networks are frequency scaled models to verify the concept. The objective of this investigation is to develop steerable antennas suitable for a use in vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communications systems. The antenna array feeding network based on Butler Matrix is optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). A GA is used to determine the optimum dimensions for the hybrid couplers and crossovers as the key elements of the network. The Butler Matrix produces orthogonal beams that can be steered in different directions. The lens-based beamformer based on Rotman Lens is capable of generating multiple beams for Electronic Scanning Arrays (ESA) and wide-band operation. To examine the performance of the proposed networks, simulated and measured results are presented and discussed. The results also demonstrate GA's appropriateness to hybrid couplers and network optimization and enhancement to develop well-established designs for systems that can be used in vehicular telematics and ITS applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555136/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11512452","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555136/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced RF steerable beamforming networks based on butler matrix and rotman lens for ITS applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced RF steerable beamforming networks based on butler matrix and rotman lens for ITS applications","confLoc":"Irkutsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052951S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547588","isNumber":"5555004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547588","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5555004","articleId":"5555136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5555155,"authors":[{"name":"Maxym V.

To improve the performances of FFT processors, various studies have been carried out to reduce the complexities of multipliers, memory interface, control schemes and so on. While the number of FFT stages increases logarithmically (log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nN) as the transform length (N) increases, the number of required registers (or, memories) increases linearly. In large transform length FFT designs, the registers occupy more than 70% of the chip area. In this paper, to reduce the memory size of IFFT for OFDM transmitters, we propose a new IFFT design method based on a combined integer mapping of modulated data, pilot and null signals. The proposed method focuses on reducing the sizes of the registers in the first two stages of the IFFT architectures since the first two stages require 75% of the total registers. By simulations of 2048-point IFFT design for cognitive radio systems, it is shown that the proposed IFFT design method achieves more than 34.7% area reduction and 33.4% power reduction compared with conventional IFFT designs.","doi":"10.1109/SIBIRCON.2010.5555186","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (SIBIRCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (SIBIRCON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547588/5555004/05555186.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBIRCON.2010.5555186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory reduction of IFFT using CIM(combined integer mapping) for OFDM transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555186/","displayDocTitle":"Memory reduction of IFFT using CIM(combined integer mapping) for OFDM transmitters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11488834","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555186/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory reduction of IFFT using CIM(combined integer mapping) for OFDM transmitters","confLoc":"Irkutsk, Russia","sourcePdf":"268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092105S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547588","isNumber":"5555004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547588","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5555004","articleId":"5555186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5555215,"authors":[{"name":"Dinh-Thuan Do","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dinh-Thuan","lastName":"Do","id":"37535085800"},{"name":"Dinh-Thanh Vu","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Dinh-Thanh","lastName":"Vu","id":"37535673000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555215","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Matrix decomposition","Receiving antennas","Block codes","Estimation","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","singular value decomposition","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-blind channel estimation","second order statistics","orthogonally coded multiple input multiple output","MIMO system","orthogonal space-time block codes","OSTBC","channel matrix estimation","singular value decomposition","SVD","blind algorithms","training-based least square","semiblind channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","orthogonal space-time block codes","second order statistics","semi-blind estimator"]}],"abstract":"A new channel estimation approach for orthogonally coded multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system is proposed. The main idea of our technique is, using specific properties of the orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) in the estimation based on the second order statistic (SOS), to estimate the channel matrix after applying singular value decomposition (SVD). This modified solution brings the simple parameters in comparison with the the conventional estimation from channel matrix directly. In this investigation, we try to reduce effect of the ambiguity which can be seen in most of the traditional blind algorithms. Because we still use the training-based least square (LS) for a part of the channel matrix and hence, our scheme can be described as the semi-blind algorithm which has strongly attracted more and more researchers in the wireless field. Our detailed analysis validates the performance and computational advantages of the proposed method. Simulation results confirm our modified scheme and illustrate that the new semi-blind channel estimation is capable of improving the quality of the overall system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new semi-blind channel estimation in MIMO using second order statistics","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555215","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555203/05555215.pdf","startPage":"V2-88","endPage":"V2-91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new semi-blind channel estimation in MIMO using second order statistics","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5555215/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516087","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new semi-blind channel estimation in MIMO using second order statistics","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp022vol2P346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043994S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","xplore-issue":"5555203","articleId":"5555215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555220,"authors":[{"name":"Chaiyan Chanapromma","affiliation":["Faculty of Industrial Technology, Uttaradit Rajabhat University, Mueang, Uttaradit, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chaiyan","lastName":"Chanapromma","id":"37541696400"},{"name":"Kanchana Daoden","affiliation":["Faculty of Industrial Technology, Uttaradit Rajabhat University, Mueang, Uttaradit, Thailand"],"firstName":"Kanchana","lastName":"Daoden","id":"37541694000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555220","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2025},"abstract":"A low-power, low-voltage CMOS fully differential operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) operating in weak inversion region is presented in this paper.

For non-superposition of each block destroy the relativity of signal, blocked DFT make aberrance to pulse compression and take bad influence in succedent processing. Sliding-window DFT beamforming can achieve good performance of pulse compression, but it has large calculating quantity.

The LDPC code can provide powerful error protection. The quasi cyclic structure which has significant advantage for memory efficiency, facilitates encoder and decoder implementation through shift register based circuits. The combination of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes and SSD is an effective technique to improve the performance of communication system for fading channel. This paper discusses a signal space diversity with a precoder by adding a simple encoder before applying the rotation matrix that can be viewed as a SSD with rate below 1. We propose three design criteria and two implementation method. And we further consider a quasi-cyclic LDPC-coded signal space diversity with precoding and their rate reallocation between channel coding and SSD. The simulation results show that our scheme outperforms the conventional coded-SSD over the fading channel when we get a better rate allocation that depends on the specific channel coding.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555283","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555203/05555283.pdf","startPage":"V2-210","endPage":"V2-214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-cyclic LDPC-coded signal space diversity with precoding over fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555283/","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-cyclic LDPC-coded signal space diversity with precoding over fading channels","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555283/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516163","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-cyclic LDPC-coded signal space diversity with precoding over fading channels","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp050vol2P392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048848S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","xplore-issue":"5555203","articleId":"5555283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5555314,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Trifonov","affiliation":["Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Trifonov","id":"37266351900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7626-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7625-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7624-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555314","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Interpolation","Decoding","Complexity theory","Iterative decoding","Construction industry","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["curve fitting","decoding","encoding","interpolation","iterative methods","polynomial approximation","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Wu list decoding algorithm","rational curve fitting","Reed-Solomon codes","partially homogenized interpolation polynomial","binary interpolation algorithm","iterative interpolation algorithm","Guruswami-Sudan method","re-encoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555314","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (SIBIRCON)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547588/5555004/05555314.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBIRCON.2010.5555314","doi":"10.1109/SIBIRCON.2010.5555314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555004","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Region 8 International Conference on Computational Technologies in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (SIBIRCON)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Another derivation of Wu list decoding algorithm and interpolation in rational curve fitting","abstract":"A novel derivation of the Wu list decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes is provided.

It is widely used in object recognition, and gets encouraging performance. But shape context is easily affected by noise points and slightly transition. In image processing, bilinear interpolation is practical and effective, allowing the resulting image appears smoother rather than jagged rendering, and more robust to slightly transition. In this paper, we use the bilinear interpolation to calculate shape context. Experimental result on 20 classes of object containing 500 images shows that robust objects matching can be achieved with our proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shape context with bilinear interpolation","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555405","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555203/05555405.pdf","startPage":"V2-442","endPage":"V2-446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Shape context with bilinear interpolation","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5555405/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516193","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shape context with bilinear interpolation","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp103vol2P493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064899S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","xplore-issue":"5555203","articleId":"5555405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5555413,"authors":[{"name":"Xie Wencheng","affiliation":["E.E.Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xie","lastName":"Wencheng","id":"37541551400"},{"name":"Zhang Xiaoling","affiliation":["E.E.Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Xiaoling","id":"37284843600"},{"name":"Shi Jun","affiliation":["E.E.Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jun","id":"37409859100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555413","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":645},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Antenna arrays","MIMO","Radar imaging","Receiving antennas","Radar antennas","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO antenna array design","airborne down-looking 3D imaging SAR","radar system","antenna array configuration","cross-track resolution","multiple-input-multiple-output antenna array model","3D SAR system stability","vibration error reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO array design","airborne down-looking three dimensional imaging SAR (ADL-3D-SAR)","MIMO radar","virtual uniform linear array"]}],"abstract":"Airborne down-looking three dimensional imaging SAR (ADL-3D-SAR) is a new radar system developed in recent years, which overcomes the shadowing effects and can gather more information compared to the conventional side looking SAR systems.

In this paper, we focus on the designing of antenna configuration and propose several new multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array models which can provide more reasonable properties for 3D SAR system's stability, applicability, and vibration errors reduction.

In IEEE 802.11b networks, the guarantee of an equal transmission opportunity for all participating nodes results in performance anomaly. Initial contention window adaptation, as one of the solutions to solve performance anomaly, has some limitations, which come from inefficient back-off mechanism. In this paper, we propose a new multi-rate MAC mechanism, which allows nodes in two hops to get each other's data rate information by introducing modifications to the control packet. In order to improve the channel utilization, nodes initialize their CWmin based on the ratio of their own data rate to their competitive nodes' data rate. We evaluate the performance of our mechanism on the network simulator NS-2. Comparing with RBAR, the proposed mechanism performs better in throughput especially when the network load is heavy since the performance anomaly problem can be solved effectively. Significant improvements are also shown in both aggregate throughput and average delay when compared with initial contention window adaptation because the proposed mechanism can avoid unnecessary back off.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555414","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555200/05555414.pdf","startPage":"V3-134","endPage":"V3-138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new MAC mechanism to resolve 802.11b performance anomaly","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555414/","displayDocTitle":"A new MAC mechanism to resolve 802.11b performance anomaly","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516564","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555414/","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new MAC mechanism to resolve 802.11b performance anomaly","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp033vol3P595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043275S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5555200","articleId":"5555414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5555424,"authors":[{"name":"Sun Zhenyu","affiliation":["Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China","Department of Navigation Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Zhenyu","id":"37541580700"},{"name":"Xu Jiangning","affiliation":["Department of Navigation Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Jiangning","id":"37541649100"},{"name":"Chen Muqing","affiliation":["Department of Navigation Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Muqing","id":"37541649500"},{"name":"Wang Jie","affiliation":["Department of Navigation Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Jie","id":"37531270300"},{"name":"Li houquan","affiliation":["Department of Navigation Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"houquan","id":"37541650300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555424","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture sonar","Velocity measurement","Motion compensation","Sonar navigation","Signal processing","Sea measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","navigation","sonar","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated underwater navigation system","precision analysis","synthetic aperture sonar motion compensation","signal processing","navigation data","position angle","attitude angle","fiber optic gyro compass","acoustic Doppler current profile"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FOGC","Octans","ADCP","Integrated Navigation","SAS"]}],"abstract":"The motion compensation of Synthetic Aperture Sonar(SAS) is a important part during the signal processing.

Method with Singular Value Decomposition (MTM-SVD) has been proposed. However, how to decide the coefficient in the spatiotemporal complex matrix constructed by MTM-SVD is still under discussion. In this paper, a new scheme, employing array signal processing, for coefficient determination is introduced. Since the sensor used in spectrum sensing is attached with antenna array, the directions of the interference sources can be computed by Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. By using multiple sensors, the position of the interference source can be estimated. Moreover, the coefficient in MTM-SVD is related to the distance between the sensor and the interference source. Therefore, a more proper value of the coefficient will be given and the interference temperature will be estimated more accurately. Simulation results show that, the proposed method has a better performance for spectrum hole detection than the conventional method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555453/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"11516411","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555453/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An improved spectrum sensing method based on multitaper-singular value decomposition in Cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved spectrum sensing method based on multitaper-singular value decomposition in Cognitive radio","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp141vol1P276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056742S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","xplore-issue":"5555236","articleId":"5555453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5555454,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Geng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Geng","id":"37528338000"},{"name":"Hanying Hu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Hanying","lastName":"Hu","id":"37292017700"},{"name":"Weijia Cui","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Weijia","lastName":"Cui","id":"37528682900"},{"name":"Yanan Dun","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, Henan, China"],"firstName":"Yanan","lastName":"Dun","id":"37541640400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555454","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":937},"abstract":"It is well known that the realization of enormous capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels depends greatly on the accuracy of channel estimation at the receiver. And the problem of pilot or training design is crucial to channel estimation. In this paper, the optimal pilot sequences and the optimal length of pilot-OFDM symbols are discussed. The optimizing process of pilot design consists of two phases. First, by minimizing the channel estimation error, the initial optimal pilot sequences are designed to exploit full information of channel correlation under the criterion of Minimum Normalized Mean Square Error (MNMSE) of the frequency domain, and at the same time, the optimal length of pilot-OFDM symbols for various range of SNR is also concluded. Secondly, in view of restraining the peak-to-average energy ratio (PAR) of the pilot-OFDM signal, the final optimal pilot sequences are obtained by choosing a unit complex-value sequence with lower aperiodic autocorrelation and using the initial optimal pilot sequences. Simulations show that the channel correlation is helpful to decrease the MNMSE of channel estimation and the designed optimal pilot sequences present great superiority in PAR-constraining.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555203/05555454.pdf","startPage":"V2-404","endPage":"V2-408","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal pilot design for MIMO OFDM channel estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio","Training","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal pilot design","MIMO OFDM channel estimation","multiple-input multiple-output channels","receiver","optimal pilot sequences","pilot-OFDM symbols","minimum normalized mean square error","MNMSE","optimal length","SNR","peak-to-average energy ratio","PAR","pilot-OFDM signal","complex-value sequence","aperiodic autocorrelation","channel correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM system","pilot sequences","spatial fading correlation","MNMSE","PAR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal pilot design for MIMO OFDM channel estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5555454/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516215","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal pilot design for MIMO OFDM channel estimation","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp094vol2P480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075196S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","xplore-issue":"5555203","articleId":"5555454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5555455,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Yan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Mechatronics Engineering and Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Yan","id":"38274337100"},{"name":"Cui Zhan-zhong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Mechatronics Engineering and Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Cui","lastName":"Zhan-zhong","id":"38274422200"},{"name":"Huang Zhong-hua","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Mechatronics Engineering and Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huang","lastName":"Zhong-hua","id":"38273159400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555455","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555455","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gradient methods","Deconvolution","Equations","Mathematical model","Time domain analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","deconvolution","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target impulse response","deconvolution algorithm","conjugate gradient method","finite integration time domain method","transient waveform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["impulse response","deconvolution","generalized conjugate gradient method","improved iteration termination condition"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555200","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deconvolution of the impulse response of the target by modified conjugate gradient method","startPage":"V3-685","endPage":"V3-688","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555200/05555455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555455","abstract":"A deconvolution algorithm based on the generalized conjugate gradient method and modified iteration termination condition was proposed to determine the impulse response of the target in the time domain.

The good agreement between the estimated and theoretical impulse responses shows that the generalized conjugate gradient method with modified iteration condition is an efficient method for inverting the impulse response of the target.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555455/","accessionNumber":"11516588","displayDocTitle":"Deconvolution of the impulse response of the target by modified conjugate gradient method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deconvolution of the impulse response of the target by modified conjugate gradient method","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp165vol3P1656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081458S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5555200","articleId":"5555455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":5555470,"authors":[{"name":"Yanli Hou","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Yanli","lastName":"Hou","id":"37534649700"},{"name":"Yafang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Yafang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540187200"},{"name":"Boning Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Boning","lastName":"Hu","id":"37534360300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555470","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Power control","Signal processing algorithms","Nash equilibrium","Chaos","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","iterative methods","multibeam antennas","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control algorithm","game theory","multiantenna cognitive radio system","maximal utility","noncooperative game","Nash equilibrium","global information transmission rate","utility function","game process","chaotic optimization algorithm","transmission power","finite game iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","power control","game theory","chaotic optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555470","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555470","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","abstract":"The power control in multi-antenna cognitive radio system has been researched with the idea of game theory.

Thus a new RLS algorithm using sliding rectangular window (RLS-SW) is presented to estimate the covariance matrix and invert it recursively. The simulation results shows that RLS-SW algorithm can maintain the diagonal loading value, which makes it more robust. Computational complexity of RLS-SW algorithm and other matrix inversion algorithm such as Gaussian elimination and RLS are analyzed and compared.

The quadratic constraint is added to the weighted least squared error between the desired and the actual beam patterns over a small region near the array steering direction, which will make the array less sensitive to the steering vector errors and nonstationary data snapshots. A new efficient and accurate approximation of the continuous direction range integration is derived and an equivalent inequality constraint is given, then the Lagrange multiplier method and the Newton's method are united to solve the equivalent equality constrained minimization problem.

This paper presents a new bit and power allocation scheme for C-OFDM systems based on the margin adaptive (MA) principle in which the overall transmission power is minimized by constraining the fixed data rate and bit error rate. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the traditional algorithm, while reducing the computational complexity from exponential to linear in the number of sub-carriers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555236/05555638.pdf","startPage":"V1-346","endPage":"V1-349","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555236","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pre-estimated resource allocation algorithm based on cognitive OFDM for multi-user","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Resource management","OFDM","Bit rate","Bit error rate","Computational complexity","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","computational complexity","error statistics","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preestimated resource allocation algorithm","cognitive OFDM","multiuser cognitive orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","next generation cellular systems","wireless local area network","WLAN","limited spectrum resources","margin adaptive principle","proportional fairness subcarrier allocation algorithm","bit allocation","power allocation","bit error rate","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive OFDM","Bit allocation","Margin Adaptive","Rate fairness","Computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A pre-estimated resource allocation algorithm based on cognitive OFDM for multi-user","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5555638/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516350","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pre-estimated resource allocation algorithm based on cognitive OFDM for multi-user","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp081vol1P137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065063S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5555236","articleId":"5555638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5555645,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyan He","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"He","id":"37534053800"},{"name":"Dequn Liang","affiliation":["Signal and Image Processing Institute, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Dequn","lastName":"Liang","id":"37069142100"},{"name":"Qisheng Cao","affiliation":["Fibre Horne Telecommunication Technologies Company Limited, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Qisheng","lastName":"Cao","id":"37531531700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555645","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bandwidth","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Constellation diagram","Equations","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high bandwidth efficiency","modulation technique","time shift non-orthogonal multicarrier modulation technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Time-Shift Non-orthogonal Multi-Carrier Modulation","Nyquist rate","bandwidth efficiency"]}],"abstract":"OFDM is a practical modulation technique with highest frequency efficiency at present and it has been adopted by many international communication standards.

The proposed technique is based on the Region Growing Method. It is automatic segmentation in which an initial seed is generated without human intervention. The seed is generated from a probabilistic map representing the chances of it being tumor. This map is created from three probabilistic functions based on location of the tumor, intensities, and non-tumor region respectively. The pixel in which the probability is the highest will be selected as potential seeds. Only one representative of these seeds will be selected as an initial seed. Then the seed will be used for region growing subsequently. The experimental results showed that the potential seeds and initial seed were correctly determined with a percentage accuracy of 81.60% and 95.10%. The seed was grown in preprocessed CT images for identifying the nasopharyngeal carcinoma region. The results showed that, perfect match and corresponding ratio were 71.31% and 53.00% respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic segmentation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma from CT images: Region growing based technique","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555663","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555203/05555663.pdf","startPage":"V2-537","endPage":"V2-541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Automatic segmentation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma from CT images: Region growing based technique","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5555663/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516064","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic segmentation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma from CT images: Region growing based technique","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp123vol2P516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041988S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5555203","articleId":"5555663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555700,"authors":[{"name":"Tangdi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Tangdi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533183500"},{"name":"Caixiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Caixiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538384600"},{"name":"Xiaowen Li","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowen","lastName":"Li","id":"37539497100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555700","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency estimation","Channel estimation","Estimation","Adaptive filters","Equations","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","channel estimation","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind adaptive scheme","joint frequency offset estimation","channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM systems","intercarrier interference","channel impulse response","channel tracker"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","intercarrier interference","carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"OFDM systems are very sensitive to frequency offset. This frequency offset results in inter-carrier interference (ICI) and, as a result, the performance of the OFDM system degrades drastically. In this paper, a blind adaptive method for joint frequency offset and channel estimation is proposed to reduce ICI effects and estimate frequency offset and channel. Adaptive technique is used to suppress these ICI effects. The channel impulse response (CIR) affected by frequency offset is tracked by a channel tracker in frequency domain. The result of the tracker is used to estimate the frequency offset and the channel. Then the frequency offset estimate is feedback to compensate the receipt signal. A blind estimation method is used, in consequence the efficiency and security of system are not reduced.

Comparing to conventional HMM, the proposed method achieves a better result.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition based Hybrid Fuzzy Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555732","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555203/05555732.pdf","startPage":"V2-661","endPage":"V2-665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition based Hybrid Fuzzy Hidden Markov Models","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5555732/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516118","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition based Hybrid Fuzzy Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp152vol2P701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072549S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","xplore-issue":"5555203","articleId":"5555732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555739,"authors":[{"name":"Huiling Xing","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Huiling","lastName":"Xing","id":"37533314000"},{"name":"Dongxing Wei","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Dongxing","lastName":"Wei","id":"37530104100"},{"name":"Fuliang Yin","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Fuliang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37269393800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555739","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Covariance matrix","Time division multiplexing","Fading","Training","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","fading channels","interleaved codes","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","random codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","orthogonal superimposed pilot","MIMO system","frequency-flat block fading","multiple-input multiple-output system","MIMO channel","transmitted data matrix","orthogonal property","random space-time symbol interleaver","transmitter","performance degradation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","orthogonal superimposed pilot (OSIP)","space-time symbol interleavin","MIMO systems"]}],"abstract":"We propose a superimposed pilot-based channel estimation scheme for frequency-flat block fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels.

It is a key issue to reliably detect the activity of primary users' (PUs) for cognitive radio users. As orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has becoming a popular technique for modern wireless communications systems. It is necessary to identify the existence and estimate the key parameters OFDM systems in cognitive radio contexts. In this paper, we propose a scheme to identify the Pus signals with OFDM. This scheme involves three steps. Firstly, we propose a method to identify the activity of signals through spectrum sensing. Then, we provide a scheme to distinguish whether an active signal is OFDM signal or single-carrier signal. At last, the key parameters of OFDM such as the number of subcarriers and the cyclic prefix length are estimated blindly. Simulation results validate the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555203/05555767.pdf","startPage":"V2-347","endPage":"V2-351","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind detection and estimation of OFDM signals in cognitive radio contexts","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Cognitive radio","Sensors","Estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Signal processing algorithms","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind detection","OFDM signal estimation","cognitive radio","frequency resource scarcity problem","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","single-carrier signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","OFDM","blind detection and estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Blind detection and estimation of OFDM signals in cognitive radio contexts","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5555767/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516150","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind detection and estimation of OFDM signals in cognitive radio contexts","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp081vol2P457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048433S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5555203","articleId":"5555767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5555775,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wei1","affiliation":["Dept. of Weaponry Engineering Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wei1","id":"37086911272"},{"name":"Zhang Xiaohui","affiliation":["Dept. of Weaponry Engineering Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Xiaohui","id":"37543561200"},{"name":"Rao Jionghui","affiliation":["Dept. of Weaponry Engineering Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Rao","lastName":"Jionghui","id":"37541330100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555775","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Optical modulation","Optical receivers","Integrated optics","Synchronization","Optical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematical analysis","optical communication","pulse modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel digital pulse interval modulation","optical wireless communication","power spectral density","mathematical model","slot-synchronization","pre-filter","synchronizer","equalizer","receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical wireless communication","spectral analysis","spectral characteristics","DC component","slot component","Multilevel Digital Pulse Interval Modulation(MDPIM)","power spectral density(PSD)"]}],"abstract":"To investigate spectral characteristics of multilevel digital pulse interval modulation (MDPIM) signal, a detailed derivation of it's power spectral density is presented.

The presented work offers considerations when designing pre-filter, synchronizer, and equalizer in receiver.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555775","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555200/05555775.pdf","startPage":"V3-366","endPage":"V3-369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral characteristics of multilevel digital pulse interval modulation in optical wireless communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555775/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral characteristics of multilevel digital pulse interval modulation in optical wireless communication","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516501","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555775/","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral characteristics of multilevel digital pulse interval modulation in optical wireless communication","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp090vol3P909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062814S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5555200","articleId":"5555775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555778,"authors":[{"name":"Umar Farooq","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Umar","lastName":"Farooq","id":"37397450300"},{"name":"Hareem Arif","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Hareem","lastName":"Arif","id":"37541374300"},{"name":"Muhammad Amar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Amar","id":"37393793900"},{"name":"Beenish Maria Tahir","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Beenish Maria","lastName":"Tahir","id":"37541373000"},{"name":"Maleeha Qasim","affiliation":["University of the Punjab, Lahore, PK"],"firstName":"Maleeha","lastName":"Qasim","id":"37542580200"},{"name":"Nauman Ahmad","affiliation":["Department of Physics, University of Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Nauman","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37528861600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555778","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555778","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Fuzzy logic","Educational robots","Artificial neural networks","Training","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","fuzzy control","mobile robots","multivariable control systems","neurocontrollers","sensors","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic control","mobile robot","line tracing operation","two input-two output system","infrared sensors","neural network based controllers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Line tracing robot","infrared sensors","fuzzy logic controller","neural network controller"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555778","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555203/05555778.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","startPage":"V2-733","endPage":"V2-739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative analysis of fuzzy logic and neural network based controllers for line tracking task in mobile robots","abstract":"In this paper, design of fuzzy logic and neural network based controllers for line tracing operation of a differentially steered mobile robot is presented.

In order to verify the performances of the designed acoustic lenses' beam patterns, a set of experiments with different objects have been performed in water tanks. The focal position and beam patterns measured in experiments are in accordance with simulation. Therefore, the hybrid geometric/wave acoustic model is proved right and effective to predict the performances of acoustic lenses before fabrication. Besides, images of different objects are also given. According to experimental results, PMMA can be used to design lens for easiness of manufacturing and low sound attenuation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555790/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"11516162","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555790/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Beam-forming and imaging using acoustic lenses: Some simulation and experimental results","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam-forming and imaging using acoustic lenses: Some simulation and experimental results","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp175vol2P754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051939S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5555203","articleId":"5555790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5555802,"authors":[{"name":"Changhua Lu","affiliation":["School of Computer & Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Changhua","lastName":"Lu","id":"37310874900"},{"name":"Jie Shen","affiliation":["School of Computer & Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Shen","id":"37537781200"},{"name":"Xiaoya Yu","affiliation":["School of Computer & Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoya","lastName":"Yu","id":"37539446400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555802","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"abstract":"Non-subsampled Contourlet transform(NSCT) with translational invariance was applied to image denoising, which could capture the intrinsic geometrical structure of bottle image.

Using inverse non-subsampled Contourlet transform to deal with the low frequency component and new high frequency components, a de-noised image of glass bottle is obtained.

The high resolution required by various modes of SAR results in a huge amount of sampling data, which brings a demand for bigger storage. Recently, a novel concept based on Compressive Sensing (CS) theory asserts that an unknown sparse signal can be recovered exactly with an overwhelming probability even with highly sub-Nyquist-rate samples. In this paper, a new scheme for the test bed of CS based SAR imaging is proposed.

Various capacity-based user selection algorithms have been proposed, most of which usually based on null multiuser interference. There is always a performance gap between channel capacity theory and real transmission rate. We study the user selection based on minimum-sum-mean-squared-error (MSMSE) criterion which can reflects the system's performance more properly. We then propose a low-complexity user selection algorithm that doesn't eliminate the multiuser interference completely and considers power allocation during the selection procedure. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a much lower BER, and attain the sum rate close to the brute-force search.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547586/5555203/05555832.pdf","startPage":"V2-702","endPage":"V2-706","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPS.2010.5555832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity user selection for MU-MIMO downlink based on MSMSE transceiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Signal processing algorithms","Bit error rate","MIMO","Transceivers","Downlink","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cochannel interference","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity user selection","MU-MIMO downlink","MSMSE transceiver","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink","channel state information","capacity-based user selection algorithm","null multiuser interference","channel capacity","minimum-sum-mean-squared-error criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiuser MIMO(MU-MIMO)","user selection","joint transceiver design","minimum-sum- mean-squared-error(MSMSE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity user selection for MU-MIMO downlink based on MSMSE transceiver","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5555832/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11516186","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity user selection for MU-MIMO downlink based on MSMSE transceiver","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp162vol2P726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060608S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547586","isNumber":"5555203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547586","xplore-issue":"5555203","articleId":"5555832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5555835,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyan Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540094000"},{"name":"Zaichen Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zaichen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37440503100"},{"name":"Chuanyou Chen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chuanyou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539298600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555835","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Channel models","Frequency selective surfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","synchronisation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust time synchronization scheme","MB-OFDM UWB system","RNDC metric","multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ultra-wideband","fast Fourier transform","restricted and normalized differential cross-correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MB-OFDM","time synchronization","UWB"]}],"abstract":"A novel time synchronization scheme is proposed for MB-OFDM UWB system.

The CP at the source node is used for combating the frequency selective fading channels and the timing errors. In this scheme, the received signals at the destination node have the orthogonal code structure on each subcarrier and thus it has the fast symbol-wise ML decoding and can achieve full spatial diversity when SNR is large without the requirement of symbol level synchronization. It should be emphasized that since no Add/Remove CP or IFFT/FFT operation is needed at the relay nodes, the relay nodes do not have to know any information about the channels and the timing errors, and the complexity of the relay nodes is very low.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","startPage":"2219","endPage":"2224","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05555877.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Orthogonal Space-Time Coding Scheme for Asynchronous Cooperative Systems for Frequency Selective Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Fading","Decoding","Delay","Cooperative systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative systems","cyclic codes","fading channels","maximum likelihood decoding","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","relays","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal space-time coding scheme","asynchronous cooperative system","frequency selective fading channel","OFDM","cyclic prefix","relay node","fast symbol-wise ML decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alamouti code","asynchronous cooperative systems","OFDM","orthogonal codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Orthogonal Space-Time Coding Scheme for Asynchronous Cooperative Systems for Frequency Selective Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5555877/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11487092","publicationDate":"August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Orthogonal Space-Time Coding Scheme for Asynchronous Cooperative Systems for Frequency Selective Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"2219-tc1008-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067096S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555878,"authors":[{"name":"Saied Hemati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada","School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5555878/5555878-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saied Hemati (S'01\u2013M'06\u2013SM'08) was born in Isfahan, Iran.

Many theoretical aspects of these decoders, thus, can be studied analytically. It is also shown that the dynamic equations can become singular for codes with cycles. When it is non-singular, the corresponding dynamic equations can be solved analytically to derive outputs of the decoder. We study the relationship between singularity and error floor and prove that absorption sets with degree two check nodes are singular graphs and under specific conditions the dynamic equations of an analog min-sum decoder can be reduced to that of an absorption set. The proposed approach paves the way for further analytical analysis on the dynamics of analog min-sum decoders and error floor in low-density parity-check codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555878/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","volume":"58","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11487093","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555878/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Dynamics of Analog Min-Sum Iterative Decoders: An Analytical Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Dynamics of Analog Min-Sum Iterative Decoders: An Analytical Approach","sourcePdf":"2225-tc1008-hemati.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076148S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5555879,"authors":[{"name":"Lingkun Kong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5555879/5555879-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingkun Kong received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering and the M.Eng. degree in communications and signal processing from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

For the sake of recovering the multiplexing loss imposed by a half-duplex three-terminal network, we employ a successive relaying protocol in this paper, where an additional relay node is activated. Hence, in order to design a near-capacity coding system, first the capacity and the achievable information-rate of a specific space-time coding aided scheme are quantified for the successive relaying aided channel. More specifically, the cooperative space-time codes employed at the source and the relays are jointly designed with the aid of EXtrinsic Information Transfer EXIT charts for the sake of high-integrity operation at Signal-to-Noise Ratios SNRs close to the corresponding successive relaying channel's capacity. Furthermore, unlike in the half-duplex single-relay based system, the destination node performs frame-by-frame Successive Interference Cancellation SIC aided iterative detection, in order to mitigate the efforts of multiple-access interference. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Irregular Cooperative Space-Time Coding Ir-CSTC scheme is capable of near-capacity operation in the successive relaying aided network, which is an explicit benefit of our joint source-and-relay transceiver design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Capacity Cooperative Space-Time Coding Employing Irregular Design and Successive Relaying","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090646","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05555879.pdf","startPage":"2232","endPage":"2241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555879/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","displayDocTitle":"Near-Capacity Cooperative Space-Time Coding Employing Irregular Design and Successive Relaying","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5555879/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487094","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Capacity Cooperative Space-Time Coding Employing Irregular Design and Successive Relaying","sourcePdf":"2232-tc1008-kong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.202672S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555880,"authors":[{"name":"Hlaing Minn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hlaing","lastName":"Minn","id":"37269620000"},{"name":"Daniel Munoz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Munoz","id":"37411289300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5555880","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1125},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Channel estimation","Estimation","Indexes","Training","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","intercarrier interference","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation pilot design","MIMO OFDM systems","frequency-dependent I/Q imbalances","multiple input multiple output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","high data rate wireless communications","semiconductor downscaling","exacerbated device impairments","intercarrier interferences","inphase and quadrature imbalances","MIMO frequency-selective channels","mean-square error optimality estimation","pilot-data-multiplexed symbols","null guard tones"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","I/Q imbalance","MIMO","OFDM","pilot design"]}],"abstract":"Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems facilitate high data rate wireless communications, and require reliable channel estimates to fully materialize their advantages. The semiconductor downscaling trend has exacerbated device impairments such as inphase and quadrature (I/Q) imbalances which cause inter-carrier interferences in OFDM systems which cannot be remedied by increasing signal power. Different RF chains of MIMO branches can cause different I/Q imbalances which further complicates MIMO OFDM channel estimation. This paper proposes several pilot designs for the estimation of the combined responses of MIMO frequency-selective channels and frequency-dependent I/Q imbalances. The proposed designs require much smaller pilot overhead than the existing designs, and also provide estimation mean-squares error optimality (under white noise) and general applicability to preamble as well as pilot-data-multiplexed symbols in MIMO systems with or without null guard tones. Performance analyses and simulation results corroborate advantages of the proposed designs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05555880.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","startPage":"2252","endPage":"2264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Designs for Channel Estimation of MIMO OFDM Systems with Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Designs for Channel Estimation of MIMO OFDM Systems with Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalances","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555880/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487095","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555880/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Designs for Channel Estimation of MIMO OFDM Systems with Frequency-Dependent I/Q Imbalances","sourcePdf":"2252-tc1008-minn.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099756S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5555881,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (EE), Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5555881/5555881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yao Ma (S'98\u2013M'01\u2013SM'08) received the B.Eng. degree from Anhui University, and the M.Sc degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), in 1993 and 1996, respectively, both in electrical engineering and information science; and the Ph.D degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore, in 2000.

We propose a PRN-willingness-based design framework for coexistence and subchannel sharing, and a Lagrange duality based technique to optimize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of secondary users (SUs) over multiple cells. First, to avoid unacceptable SU interference to primary users (PUs), the PRN determines its interference margin based on its target performance metric and channel conditions, and broadcasts this information to the CRN. Second, each CRN cell optimizes its WSR and implements intercell iterative waterfilling (IC-IWF) to control the intercell interference. To account for the interference and transmit power limits at SUs, multilevel waterfilling (M-WF) and direct-power truncation (DPT) duality schemes are developed. Third, we develop a serial dual update technique which enables low-complexity and fast-convergence of the proposed duality schemes. Numerical results demonstrate the effects of multiple parameters, such as the number of SUs per cell, subchannel occupancy probability (SOP), and outage probability of the PUs. Our results show that the proposed duality schemes provide a large performance enhancement than the channel-greedy and access-fairness based resource allocation schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of OFDMA-Based Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.080444","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05555881.pdf","startPage":"2265","endPage":"2276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.080444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of OFDMA-Based Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5555881/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487096","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of OFDMA-Based Cellular Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2265-tc1008-ma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075691S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5555882,"authors":[{"name":"Usa Vilaipornsawai","affiliation":["Institute for Systems and Robotics, University of Algarve, Faro, Portugal","Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McGill University, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5555882/5555882-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Usa Vilaipornsawai (S'01) received the B.Eng degree from King Mongkut University of Technology Thonburi, Thailand, in 1997 and the M.Sc.degree in electrical and computer engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2001.

We propose an algorithm, called Doppler Adaptive Smoothed Data Detection and Kalman Estimation (DA-SDD-KE), that jointly detects data and estimates the channel as well as the time-varying Doppler. In this scheme, an Adaptive Kalman Predictor (AKP) consisting of a KP and a covariance-based Doppler estimator is incorporated into a Per-Survivor Processing (PSP)-based algorithm that utilizes the past, present and future received symbols for smoothed data detection. For comparison purposes, we also develop a Doppler Adaptive version of the Delayed Mixture Kalman Filtering (DMKF) technique, referred to as DA-DMKF, where the adaptive estimations of the channel and the Doppler shift are based on sequences of importance samples. Moreover, we propose a model for generating a Rayleigh fading process with time-varying Doppler using the sum of sinusoids method. The performance of the DA-SDD-KE and DA-DMKF algorithms over channels with constant, linear and quadratic Doppler functions is evaluated using computer simulations, revealing that the DA-SDD-KE algorithm performs well for all considered Doppler functions, and provides a considerably gain over the DA-DMKF algorithm.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05555882.pdf","startPage":"2277","endPage":"2291","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Data Detection and Channel Estimation for Fading Unknown Time-Varying Doppler Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Data Detection and Channel Estimation for Fading Unknown Time-Varying Doppler Environments","htmlLink":"/document/5555882/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487097","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Data Detection and Channel Estimation for Fading Unknown Time-Varying Doppler Environments","sourcePdf":"2277-tc1008-vilaipornsawai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109945S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555883,"authors":[{"name":"Audrey Giremus","affiliation":["Equipe Signal et Image in the Department LAPS UMR CNRS IMS, Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5555883/5555883-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Audrey Giremus received the engineer degree and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from SUPAERO (ENSAE) in Toulouse, France, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

Formerly, particle filtering has been introduced as a set of promising methods to solve communication problems. PF consists in simulating possible values of the unkwnown parameters and selecting the most likely candidates with regard to the received signal. Here, the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is used to significantly decrease the variance of the channel/symbol estimates. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, sinusoidal stochastic models have been shown to better represent the statistical properties of Rayleigh channels than classical autoregressive models. Therefore, the proposed RBPF estimator is based on these models which are expressed as the sum of two sinusoids in quadrature at the maximum Doppler frequency with autoregressive processes as amplitudes. The model parameters are unknown and need to be estimated. Since PFs are not well-suited to recover non-varying parameters, we propose to cross-couple the RBPF with a Kalman filter which makes use of the RBPF ouputs to sequentially update the parameters. Secondly, the choice of an efficient proposal distribution to simulate the particles is crucial for PF performance. We suggest using a suboptimal distribution which simulates likely values of the symbols at a reasonable computational cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter for Joint Channel/Symbol Estimation in MC-DS-CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.070558","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05555883.pdf","startPage":"2292","endPage":"2304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.070558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555883/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter for Joint Channel/Symbol Estimation in MC-DS-CDMA Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5555883/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487098","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter for Joint Channel/Symbol Estimation in MC-DS-CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"2292-tc1008-giremus.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103523S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555884,"authors":[{"name":"Fanggang Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5555884/5555884-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fanggang Wang received the B.S. degree in the School of Information and Communication Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China in 2005.

The K-S test is a non-parametric method to measure the goodness of fit. The basic procedure involves computing the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of some decision statistic derived from the received signal, and comparing it with the CDFs or the ECDFs of the signal under each candidate modulation format. The K-S-based modulation classifiers are developed for various channels, including the AWGN channel, the flat-fading channel, the OFDM channel, and the channel with unknown phase and frequency offsets, as well as the non-Gaussian noise channel, for both QAM and PSK modulations. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that compared with the traditional cumulant-based classifiers, the proposed K-S classifiers offer superior classification performance, require less number of signal samples (thus is fast), and is more robust to various channel impairments.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05555884.pdf","startPage":"2324","endPage":"2332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Robust Modulation Classification via Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Robust Modulation Classification via Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555884/","publicationDate":"August 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11487099","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555884/","volume":"58","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Robust Modulation Classification via Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test","sourcePdf":"2324-tc1008-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148875S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5555887,"authors":[{"name":"Mylene Pischella","affiliation":["Electronics and Communications Laboratory, Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5555887/5555887-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mylene Pischella (M'09) received the engineering degree and the Ph.D degree from Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech), Paris, France, in 2002 and 2009, respectively.

Resource allocation is distributed within each Base Station. Two cases are considered: full CSIT, and statistical CSIT. In both cases, a distributed convergence criterion for power control is determined and included within iterative power allocation. In the statistical CSIT case, an approximate analytical expression is obtained for the outage capacity, as a function of the SNR and the outage probability. It turns the MA problem into a convex optimization problem, and is valid at practical SNR and outage capacity values, for several antenna configurations. The proposed methods avoid power divergence situations at any load, and are consequently more efficient than iterative water-filling to solve the MA problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05555887.pdf","startPage":"2371","endPage":"2380","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.080678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.080678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Margin Adaptive Resource Allocation in MIMO OFDMA Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Power control","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Convergence","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed margin adaptive resource allocation","MIMO OFDMA multicell networks","power control","iterative power allocation","iterative water-filling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed resource allocation","margin adaptive problem","MIMO","OFDMA","inter-cell interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Margin Adaptive Resource Allocation in MIMO OFDMA Networks","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5555887/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487103","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Margin Adaptive Resource Allocation in MIMO OFDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"2371-tc1008-pischella.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07914S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5555888,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5555888/5555888-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Chen (S'06) received the bachelor's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2004 and the M.Phil degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2007.

Although many works have been proposed recently in the area of cognitive radio for data communications, little effort has been made in content-aware multimedia applications over cognitive radio networks. In this paper, we study the multimedia streaming problem over cognitive radio networks, where there is one primary user and N secondary users. The uniquely scalable and delay-sensitive characteristics of multimedia data and the resulting impact on users' viewing experiences of multimedia content are explicitly involved in the utility functions, due to which the primary user and the secondary users can seamlessly switch among different quality levels to achieve the largest utilities. Then, we formulate the spectrum allocation problem as an auction game and propose three distributively auction-based spectrum allocation schemes, which are spectrum allocation using Single object pay-as-bid Ascending Clock Auction (ACA-S), spectrum allocation using Traditional Ascending Clock Auction (ACA-T), and spectrum allocation using Alternative Ascending Clock Auction (ACA-A). We prove that all three algorithms converge in a finite number of clocks. We also prove that ACA-S and ACA-A are cheat-proof while ACA-T is not. Moreover, we show that ACA-T and ACA-A can maximize the social welfare while ACA-S may not. Therefore, ACA-A is a good solution to multimedia cognitive radio networks since it can achieve maximal social welfare in a cheat-proof way. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","volume":"58","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"11487105","publicationDate":"August 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555888/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Auction Games for Multimedia Streaming Over Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Auction Games for Multimedia Streaming Over Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"2381-tc1008-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112419S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5555889,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Ponnuru","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5555869/5555889/5555889-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sandeep Ponnuru received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in 2006.

A promising approach is to use a time-interleaved (TI) architecture with slower sub-ADCs in parallel, but mismatch among the sub-ADCs, if left uncompensated, can cause error floors in receiver performance. Conventional mismatch compensation schemes typically have complexity (in terms of number of multiplications) that increases with the desired resolution at the output of the TI-ADC. In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach, in which mismatch and channel dispersion are compensated jointly, with the performance metric being overall link reliability rather than ADC performance. For an OFDM system, we characterize the structure of mismatch-induced interference, and demonstrate the efficacy of a frequency-domain interference suppression scheme whose complexity is independent of constellation size (which determines the desired resolution). Numerical results from computer simulation and from experiments on a hardware prototype show that the performance with the proposed joint mismatch and channel compensation technique is close to that without mismatch. While the proposed technique works with offline estimates of mismatch parameters, we provide an iterative, online method for joint estimation of mismatch and channel parameters which leverages the training overhead already available in communication signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5555869/05555889.pdf","startPage":"2391","endPage":"2401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.08.090693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Mismatch and Channel Compensation for High-Speed OFDM Receivers with Time-Interleaved ADCs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Timing","Receivers","Complexity theory","Noise","Equalizers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","compensation","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","telecommunication network reliability","transceivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint mismatch compensation","channel compensation","high-speed OFDM receivers","time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters","digital transceivers","multiGigabit communication systems","channel dispersion","mismatched dispersion","overall link reliability","frequency-domain interference suppression scheme","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-gigabit","analog-to-digital converter","time-interleaved A/D converter","OFDM","mismatch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Mismatch and Channel Compensation for High-Speed OFDM Receivers with Time-Interleaved ADCs","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5555889/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2010","accessionNumber":"11487106","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Mismatch and Channel Compensation for High-Speed OFDM Receivers with Time-Interleaved ADCs","sourcePdf":"2391-tc1008-ponnuru.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082081S","chronDate":"August  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5555869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5555869","articleId":"5555889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555895,"authors":[{"name":"Gu Zhaozhi","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Dongying, China"],"firstName":"Gu","lastName":"Zhaozhi","id":"37541287000"},{"name":"Liu Sheng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37532698900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6893-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6892-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5555895","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"abstract":"Channel capacity formula of MIMO system before and after antenna selection is derived.

Ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) transmission is a promising technology for location-aware sensor networks, due to its power efficiency, fine delay resolution, and robust operation in harsh environments. However, the presence of walls and other obstacles presents a significant challenge in terms of localization, as they can result in positively biased distance estimates. We have performed an extensive indoor measurement campaign with FCC-compliant UWB radios to quantify the effect of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. From these channel pulse responses, we extract features that are representative of the propagation conditions. We then develop classification and regression algorithms based on machine learning techniques, which are capable of: (i) assessing whether a signal was transmitted in LOS or NLOS conditions; and (ii) reducing ranging error caused by NLOS conditions. We evaluate the resulting performance through Monte Carlo simulations and compare with existing techniques. In contrast to common probabilistic approaches that require statistical models of the features, the proposed optimization-based approach is more robust against modeling errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555901/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","volume":"28","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11523375","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555901/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"NLOS identification and mitigation for localization based on UWB experimental data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NLOS identification and mitigation for localization based on UWB experimental data","sourcePdf":"1026jsac0710marano.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108459S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5555896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"333","xplore-issue":"5555896","articleId":"5555901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5555902,"authors":[{"name":"Panagiotis Papadimitratos","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPFL-Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5555896/5555902/5555902-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Panos Papadimitratos earned his PhD from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2005.

In this paper, we first identify a typical attacker, called parasitic adversary, who seeks to exploit sensor networks by obtaining measurements in an unauthorized way. As a countermeasure, we first employ a randomized key refreshing: with low communication cost, it aims at confining (but not eliminating) the effects of the adversary. Moreover, our low-complexity solution, GossiCrypt, leverages on the large scale of sensor networks to protect data confidentiality, efficiently and effectively. GossiCrypt applies symmetric key encryption to data at their source nodes; and it applies re-encryption at a randomly chosen subset of nodes en route to the sink. The combination of randomized key refreshing and GossiCrypt protects data confidentiality with a probability of almost 1; we show this analytically and with simulations. In addition, the energy consumption of GossiCrypt is lower than a public-key based solution by several orders of magnitude.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Encryption","Protocols","Markov processes","Silicon","Public key"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public key cryptography","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","parasitic adversary","randomized key refreshing","GossiCrypt","data confidentiality protection","symmetric key encryption","public key encryption","network security","parasitic adversaries"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Confidentiality","Security","Probabilistic Key Refreshing and En-route Encryption","GossiCrypt"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5555896/05555902.pdf","startPage":"1036","endPage":"1045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100908","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A randomized countermeasure against parasitic adversaries in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A randomized countermeasure against parasitic adversaries in wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555902/","volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555902/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11523376","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A randomized countermeasure against parasitic adversaries in wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"1036jsac0710papa.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.200568S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5555896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5555896","articleId":"5555902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555903,"authors":[{"name":"Aggelos Bletsas","affiliation":["Telecom Laboratory, Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Greece","Radio-Communications Laboratory (RCL), Department of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5555896/5555903/5555903-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aggelos Bletsas (S'03'M'05) received with excellence his diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece in 1998, and the S.M. and Ph.D. degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001 and 2005, respectively.

In the proposed system, nodes are activated only when they are triggered to send their own data to the fusion center directly, without burdening the network with MAC layer collisions and energy-consuming routing algorithms, thus guaranteeing long lifetime cycles. The nodes consist of a simple active reflector circuit which is synchronized by an incident wave transmitted by a distant base station. Since the nodes can be deployed in large numbers, the network acts as a single antenna array with high directive gain pointing towards the direction of the fusion center. At the receiver, data from each node can be de-multiplexed with the use of a frequency shift keying direct sequence spread spectrum modulation scheme that enables multiple access without destroying the beamforming characteristics of the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","volume":"28","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"11523391","publicationDate":"September 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555904/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A co-operative beamforming solution for eliminating multi-hop communications in wireless sensor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A co-operative beamforming solution for eliminating multi-hop communications in wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"1055jsac0710kalis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078057S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5555896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5555896","articleId":"5555904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555905,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5555896/5555905/5555905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Wang (SM'09) received the B.Sc. degree and the M.Sc. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Auburn University, Auburn, AL, in 2004, all in electrical engineering.","From September 2004 to August 2006, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.

In this paper, we investigate a joint optimal design of the physical, medium access control (MAC) and routing layers to maximize NL of a multiple-sources and single-sink (MSSS) WSN with energy constraints. The problem of NL maximization (NLM) can be formulated as a mixed integer-convex optimization problem with adoption of time division multiple access (TDMA) technique. When the integer constraints are relaxed to take real values, the problem can be transformed into a convex problem and the solution achieves the upper bounds. We provide an analytical framework for the relaxed NLM problem of a WSN in general planar topology. We first restrict the topologies to the planar networks on a small scale, including triangle and regular quadrangle topologies. In this special case, we employ the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to derive analytical expressions of the globally optimal NL, which take the influence of data rate, link access and routing into account. To handle larger scale planar networks, an iterative algorithm is proposed using the D&C approach. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can be extended to the large planar case and its performance is close to globally optimal performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100917","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5555896/05555911.pdf","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1137","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network lifetime optimization in wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","displayDocTitle":"Network lifetime optimization in wireless sensor networks","volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5555911/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11523383","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network lifetime optimization in wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"1127jsac0710wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067043S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5555896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5555896","articleId":"5555911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5555913,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5555896/5555913/5555913-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Yang (M'10) received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2001, the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, in 2009.","From 2002 to 2004, he was with the Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore, as a Research Student.

Such framework is scalable with respect to the network size, and is able to greatly reduce the dependence on the central fusion center. It assumes a clustering infrastructure, and addresses signal processing and communications related issues arising from different layers. This framework includes a distributed scheduling protocol and a distributed routing protocol, which enable sensor nodes to make their own decisions about information transmissions, without requiring the knowledge of the network global information. In this framework, energy efficiency manifests itself at different network layers in a distributed fashion, and a balance between the detection performance and the energy efficiency is also attained.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555896","startPage":"1149","endPage":"1158","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5555896/05555913.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed and energy-efficient framework for Neyman-Pearson detection of fluctuating signals in large-scale sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555913/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A distributed and energy-efficient framework for Neyman-Pearson detection of fluctuating signals in large-scale sensor networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11523384","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed and energy-efficient framework for Neyman-Pearson detection of fluctuating signals in large-scale sensor networks","sourcePdf":"1149jsac0710yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060102S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5555896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5555896","articleId":"5555913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555919,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Santi","affiliation":["IIT-CNR, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5555896/5555919/5555919-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Santi received the Laura Degree summa cum laude and Ph.D. Degree in Computer Science from the University of Pisa in 1994 and 2000, respectively.

We consider a scenario in which s(n) out of n total network nodes have to deliver data to a set of d(n) sink nodes at a constant rate \u03bb(n, s(n), d(n)). The goal is to characterize the maximum achievable rate, and the latency in data delivery. We present a simple data gathering scheme that achieves asymptotically optimal data gathering capacity and latency with arbitrary network deployments when d(n) = 1, and for most scaling regimes of s(n) and d(n) when d(n) > 1 in case of square grid and random node deployments. Differently from most previous work, our results and the presented data gathering scheme do not sacrifice energy efficiency to the need of maximizing capacity and minimizing latency. Finally, we consider the effects of a simple form of data aggregation on data gathering performance, and show that capacity can be increased by a factor f(n) with respect to the case of no data aggregation, where f(n) is the node density. To the best of our knowledge, the ones presented in this paper are the first results showing that asymptotically optimal data gathering capacity and latency can be achieved in arbitrary networks in an energy efficient way.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2010.100925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5555896/05555919.pdf","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2010.100925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5555896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the data gathering capacity and latency in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555919/","displayDocTitle":"On the data gathering capacity and latency in wireless sensor networks","volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11523388","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555919/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the data gathering capacity and latency in wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"1211jsac0710santi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072057S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5555896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5555896","articleId":"5555919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5555927,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Ling Hu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chuan-Ling","lastName":"Hu","id":"37539062000"},{"name":"De-Lun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"De-Lun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37534331200"},{"name":"Huang-Lin Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Huang-Lin","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37530578100"},{"name":"Chang-Fa Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chang-Fa","lastName":"Yang","id":"37350106400"},{"name":"Chang-Lun Liao","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chang-Lun","lastName":"Liao","id":"37532818000"},{"name":"Shun-Tian Lin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shun-Tian","lastName":"Lin","id":"37534990400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5555927","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1832},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A multibranch inverted-F antenna with multiband operations for long-term evolution (LTE), pentaband wireless wide area network (WWAN) and IMT-E (2.6 GHz) applications is presented.

Based on the method of Maclaurin series expansion, the derivation is aimed to suppress the redundant truncation errors into minimum levels by eliminating the first several series terms of difference between the numerical and theoretical solutions to a modeled susceptibility. The accuracy of numerical approximation to theoretical dielectric functions based on our proposed approach is shown to be exactly equivalent to the bilinear transformation model for the single-pole dispersion response of the modeled dispersive material, but higher than those of other two previously reported models for a two-pole dispersion response of a modeled dispersive material. The explicit coefficients of the proposed model for several classical types of dispersive materials are derived and their corresponding dominant truncation errors are given as well. Both the analytical and simulation results obtained from the FDTD modeling of an exemplified material, silver, demonstrate that the new model outperforms the other models when they are incorporated into the fourth-order accurate FDTD algorithm with small numerical dispersion error rather than in the second-order one with large numerical dispersion error.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2069084","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5562444/05555946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2069084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562444","startPage":"2843","endPage":"2850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generally Optimized FDTD Model for Simulating Arbitrary Dispersion Based on the Maclaurin Series Expansion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Generally Optimized FDTD Model for Simulating Arbitrary Dispersion Based on the Maclaurin Series Expansion","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"19","publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2010","accessionNumber":"11528311","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555946/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generally Optimized FDTD Model for Simulating Arbitrary Dispersion Based on the Maclaurin Series Expansion","sourcePdf":"jlt-lin-2069084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080869S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5562444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5562444","articleId":"5555946","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5555947,"authors":[{"name":"Jongwoon Park","affiliation":["OLED Lighting Team, National Center of Nanoprocess and Equipment, Korea Institute of Industrial and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Jongwoon Park received the B.S. degree in radio engineering from Kyunghee University, Suwon, Korea, in 1999, the M.S. degree from the University of Victoria, B.C., Canada, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from McMaster University, On, Canada, in 2004.","He joined the Department of Electronic Science and Engineering at Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, as a postdoctoral fellow in 2005.

To find ways to increase the response speed of large-area OLEDs, we make an in-depth study of transient electroluminescence (EL) of OLEDs in response to voltage pulses (i.e., pulse separation), device configurations (i.e., device length), and various material parameters (e.g., carrier mobility, exciton lifetime, and energy level offset). The EL response speed can be increased by applying high bias voltage and reducing the device length. Meanwhile, the pulse separation affects the response speed of the second pulse. As the pulse separation is decreased, the ratio of the delay time of the second pulse to the delay time of the first pulse is found to be reduced, whereas the ratio of the peak luminance of the second pulse to the peak one of the first pulse is getting increased. We have also shown that the dependence of the delay time on the carrier mobility, exciton lifetime, and energy level offset is less pronounced. This study may provide design guidelines of OLEDs for practical applications including ac-driven displays and next-generation visible-light communications (VLCs).","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2069552","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5562444/05555947.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2069552","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"2873","endPage":"2880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speedup of Dynamic Response of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Speedup of Dynamic Response of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555947/","volume":"28","issue":"19","htmlLink":"/document/5555947/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2010","accessionNumber":"11534051","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speedup of Dynamic Response of Organic Light-Emitting Diodes","sourcePdf":"jlt-park-2069552-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053605S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5562444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5562444","articleId":"5555947","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5555948,"authors":[{"name":"Jan-Peter Engelstaedter","affiliation":["The III-V Group, Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Jan-Peter Engelstaedter received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering and information technology from Aachen University of Technology (RWTH Aachen), Germany, in 2006.

A promising, controllable, residential distributed generation technology is a microcombined heat and power system (micro-CHP). Micro-CHP is an energy-efficient technology that simultaneously provides heat and electricity to households. In this paper, we investigate to what extent domestic energy costs could be reduced with intelligent, price-based control concepts (demand response). Hereby, first the performance of a standard, so-called heat-led micro-CHP system is analyzed. Then, a model-predictive control (MPC) strategy aimed at demand response is proposed for more intelligent control of micro-CHP systems. Simulation studies illustrate the added value of the proposed intelligent control approach over the standard approach in terms of reduced variable energy costs. Demand response with micro-CHP lowers variable costs for households by about 1%-14%. The cost reductions are highest with the most strongly fluctuating real-time pricing scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2010.2053831","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5669979/05555951.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2010.2053831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669979","startPage":"200","endPage":"213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demand Response With Micro-CHP Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555951","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Demand Response With Micro-CHP Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555951/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"99","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11698366","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555951/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand Response With Micro-CHP Systems","sourcePdf":"jproc-houwing-2053831-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114296S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5669979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"172","xplore-issue":"5669979","articleId":"5555951","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5555953,"authors":[{"name":"Robert J.

Recently, 3-D integration with through-silicon vias (TSVs) has emerged as an effective solution to meet the future interconnect requirement. Among others, thermomechanical reliability is a key concern for the development of TSV structures used in die stacking as 3-D interconnects. This paper examines the effects of thermally induced stresses on the interfacial reliability of TSV structures. First, 3-D distribution of the thermal stress near the TSV and the wafer surface is analyzed. Using a linear superposition method, a semianalytic solution is developed for a simplified structure consisting of a single TSV embedded in a silicon (Si) wafer. The solution is verified for relatively thick wafers by comparing to numerical results from finite element analysis (FEA). The stress analysis suggests interfacial delamination as a potential failure mechanism for the TSV structure. An analytical solution is then obtained for the steady-state energy release rate as the upper bound for the interfacial fracture driving force, while the effect of crack length is evaluated numerically by FEA. With these results, the effects of the TSV dimensions (e.g., via diameter and wafer thickness) on the interfacial reliability are elucidated. Furthermore, the effects of via material properties and dielectric buffer layers are discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Through-silicon vias","Silicon","Thermal stresses","Delamination","Cooling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","integrated circuit interconnections","reliability","thermal stresses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-surface thermal stresses","interfacial reliability","through-silicon vias","3D interconnects","continual scaling","on-chip wiring structures","linear superposition method","semianalytic solution","finite element analysis","crack length","material properties","dielectric buffer layers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interfacial delamination","thermal stress","through-silicon via (TSV)","3-D interconnects"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555956","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2010.2068572","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/7298/5729994/05555956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2010.2068572","startPage":"35","endPage":"43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5729994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Near-Surface Thermal Stresses on Interfacial Reliability of Through-Silicon Vias for 3-D Interconnects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Near-Surface Thermal Stresses on Interfacial Reliability of Through-Silicon Vias for 3-D Interconnects","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555956/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5555956/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11873203","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Near-Surface Thermal Stresses on Interfacial Reliability of Through-Silicon Vias for 3-D Interconnects","sourcePdf":"tdmr-huang-2068572-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075873S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"5729994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"194","xplore-issue":"5729994","articleId":"5555956","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5555961,"authors":[{"name":"Mattia Boniardi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5580182/5555961/5555961-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mattia Boniardi was born in Milano, Italy, in 1982.

Due to the metastable nature of the amorphous state, the memory can exhibit a time variation of resistance after programming as a result of two main mechanisms: 1) structural relaxation (SR), which is an atomic rearrangement to minimize the defect density, and 2) crystallization of the amorphous chalcogenide. SR has been mostly studied at the single-cell level, whereas a statistical analysis and modeling is necessary for device reliability estimation and prediction. This work studies the statistical behavior of SR in PCM devices, through experimental and modeling approaches. Statistical SR data from PCM arrays are shown, and a Monte Carlo model for SR statistics is proposed, based on previous physical modeling of the SR process. This model allows for long-term, physics-based, and array-level reliability extrapolations in large PCM arrays.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2010.2058771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5580182/05555961.pdf","startPage":"2690","endPage":"2696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2010.2058771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistics of Resistance Drift Due to Structural Relaxation in Phase-Change Memory Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Statistics of Resistance Drift Due to Structural Relaxation in Phase-Change Memory Arrays","volume":"57","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11533878","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5555961/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555961/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistics of Resistance Drift Due to Structural Relaxation in Phase-Change Memory Arrays","sourcePdf":"ted-boniardi-2058771-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079109S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5580182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5580182","articleId":"5555961","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5555962,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Braga","affiliation":["University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5580182/5555962/5555962-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefania Braga was born in Italy in 1983.

The contact pressure of the C-shaped armature at start-up arises from its initial mechanical interference. As armature wear grows and temperature rises, the initial mechanical interference decreases. When the current is established, the electromagnetic (EM) force provides the contact pressure. Transition usually occurs when the current ramps down, except for relatively light situations that have low currents and speeds. In this paper, launch experiments with armatures of the same geometry and material under different driving current amplitudes were performed. Based on the experimental results, the temperature rise of the armature with increasing action was analyzed. Then, the preload during the period of temperature increase was analyzed. In a simplified model, the EM force was also analyzed. The results indicate that the sum of preload and EM force has shown a decreasing trend. To reduce the consequence of EM force that decreases with current ramp-down, a partially augmented railgun, which could maintain adequate contact pressure in current ramp-down, is proposed. The feasibility of this kind of railgun is also analyzed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5680667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2010.2055246","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/5680667/05555982.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"52","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2010.2055246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmentation of Current Ramp-Down Contact Pressure in C-Shaped Armature Railguns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Augmentation of Current Ramp-Down Contact Pressure in C-Shaped Armature Railguns","volume":"39","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5555982/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11733386","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmentation of Current Ramp-Down Contact Pressure in C-Shaped Armature Railguns","sourcePdf":"tps-xiao-2055246-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046494S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"5680667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5680667","articleId":"5555982","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5555992,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Krikidis","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics, University of Patras, Rio-Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Krikidis","id":"37275149300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5555992","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":89,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1647},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Diversity methods","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Network topology","Bidirectional control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","radio repeaters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay selection","two-way relay channels","MABC DF","multiple-access broadcast","decode-and-forward relaying","bidirectional relay networks","max-min technique","max-sum technique","maximum diversity gain","signal-to-noise ratio","outage probability","diversity gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative networks","decode-and-forward (DF)","diversity","outage probability","two-way relay channel"]}],"abstract":"We propose relay-selection techniques for a two-way relay channel, where two terminals simultaneously transmit to each other with the help of a relay. In particular, we focus on a multiple-access broadcast two-way relay channel with a decode-and-forward (DF) relaying policy, which is a main technique for bidirectional relay networks. Two main relay selection metrics, which depend on the instantaneous channel conditions and allow a single best relay to assist the bidirectional communication between the two end sources, are investigated. The first one is the conventional max-min technique, and the second one is the max-sum technique that maximizes the instantaneous sum rate. We prove that the max-min relay-selection policy extracts the maximum diversity gain and is a suitable selection scheme for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, whereas the max-sum scheme is appropriate for low SNRs. An intelligent switching between max-min and max-sum is also proposed. The proposed schemes are analyzed in terms of outage probability and diversity gain and are validated via explicit theoretical and numerical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Selection for Two-Way Relay Channels With MABC DF: A Diversity Perspective","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2069106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5613993/05555992.pdf","startPage":"4620","endPage":"4628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2069106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555992/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Relay Selection for Two-Way Relay Channels With MABC DF: A Diversity Perspective","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5555992/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630029","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Selection for Two-Way Relay Channels With MABC DF: A Diversity Perspective","sourcePdf":"tvt-krikidis-2069106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054878S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5613993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5613993","articleId":"5555992","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5555993,"authors":[{"name":"Xingliang Huo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Dynamic Geodesy, Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5673442/5555993/5555993-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xingliang Huo received the B.Sc. degree in surveying engineering from Chang'an University, Xi'an, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in geodesy and surveying engineering from the Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2008.","His current research interests include ionospheric delay monitoring and modeling for the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the effects of ionosphere weather on GNSS navigation and positioning.","Dr. Huo was the recipient of several awards, including the National Science and Technology Progress Award in Surveying and Mapping (First-class Prize) and the State Scientific and Technological Progress Award (Second-class Prize)."]},"firstName":"Xingliang","lastName":"Huo","id":"37528587900"},{"name":"Yunbin Yuan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Dynamic Geodesy, Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5673442/5555993/5555993-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Yunbin Yuan received the B.Sc. degree in surveying engineering from the Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree in geodesy and surveying from the Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics (IGG), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Wuhan, China, in 2002.","He is currently a Professor and the Director of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Application and Research Group, IGG, CAS.

Results show that the plasma congregates and rises above the geomagnetic equator due to the daytime upward vertical drift during the early variations of EIA. After being lifted to higher altitudes, the topside ionospheric equatorial plasma above the CHAMP orbit (over 400 km above the ground) controlled mainly by the electromagnetic field starts to diffuse downward to higher latitudes along magnetic field lines, and the double-humped structure begins to appear in the topside ionosphere above the CHAMP orbit. However, a single crest is still observed for the entire ionosphere above the ground, and this single peak moves slightly to the winter hemisphere as a result of the transequatorial neutral wind. With the continuous diffusion of the plasma, the two crests also occur for the entire ionosphere at both sides of the geomagnetic equator.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2055875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5673442/05555993.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2055875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673442","startPage":"105","endPage":"114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring the Daytime Variations of Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly Using IONEX Data and CHAMP GPS Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring the Daytime Variations of Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly Using IONEX Data and CHAMP GPS Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11725478","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555993/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring the Daytime Variations of Equatorial Ionospheric Anomaly Using IONEX Data and CHAMP GPS Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-huo-2055875-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11876S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5673442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5673442","articleId":"5555993","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5555996,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ma","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Laboratory of Applications of Remote Sensing, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5607221/5555996/5555996-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Ma (S'10) received the M.S. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2006.

Making an accurate digital elevation model (DEM) from an interferogram is often seriously affected by a mass of singular points (SPs) included in the interferogram. The origin of a type of SPs lies in inaccurate coregistration in making the interferogram. However, there have not been any method more effective than affine transformation based on cross correlation. Numerous research works have aimed at how to process the SPs resulting in the coregistration. In this paper, contrarily, we propose an additional method of local and nonlinear coregistration which employs the number of SPs as the evaluation criterion. This method provides us with an interferogram to generate a more accurate DEM. Experiments demonstrate that, with the proposed method, we can obtain a DEM having higher signal-to-noise ratios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5555997/","accessionNumber":"11704646","displayDocTitle":"SPEC Method\u2014A Fine Coregistration Method for SAR Interferometry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPEC Method\u2014A Fine Coregistration Method for SAR Interferometry","sourcePdf":"tgrs-natsuaki-2057435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053822S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5673442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5673442","articleId":"5555997","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5555998,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["Digital Media Laboratory, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5673442/5555998/5555998-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Li received the B.S. degree in computer science from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 1986, the M.S. degree in computer science from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 1993.","In 1993, he joined the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, where he has been a Full Professor since 1997.

The proposed 2-D OWT can perform integrative oriented transform in arbitrary direction and achieve a significant transform coding gain. To maximize the transform coding gain, two separable 1-D transforms are implemented in the same direction for local areas with direction consistency. Subpixel interpolation rules are designed for rectangular subbands generation. In addition, semidirection displacement is adjusted to handle direction mismatch after the first 1-D transform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 2-D OWT compression scheme outperforms JPEG2000 for remote-sensing images with high resolution, up to 0.43 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), 0.0261 in the measure of structural similarity, 0.44% in Kappa coefficients, respectively, and significant subjective improvement. Meanwhile, it outperforms JPEG2000, previous adaptive directional lifting and weighted adaptive lifting methods, up to 1.98, 0.36, and 0.19 dB in PSNR for natural images. Furthermore, it is suitable for real-time remote-sensing processing for its low computational cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5673442/05555998.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2056691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2056691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673442","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5555998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote-Sensing Image Compression Using Two-Dimensional Oriented Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Remote sensing","Image edge detection","Wavelet transforms","Pixel","Transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","geophysical image processing","image coding","remote sensing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote-sensing image compression","two-dimensional oriented wavelet transform","2-D OWT","integrative oriented transform","transform coding gain","subpixel interpolation","JPEG2000","peak signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image compression","oriented resample","remote-sensing image","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5555998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Remote-Sensing Image Compression Using Two-Dimensional Oriented Wavelet Transform","volume":"49","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5555998/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11725484","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote-Sensing Image Compression Using Two-Dimensional Oriented Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tgrs-yang-2056691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136248S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5673442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5673442","articleId":"5555998","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5556001,"authors":[{"name":"Salvador Ceballos","affiliation":["Energy Unit, Robotiker-Tecnalia Research Centre, Zamudio, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5765746/5556001/5556001-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Salvador Ceballos received the B.S. degree in physics from the University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain, in 2001 and the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain, in 2002 and 2008, respectively.","From May 2008 to May 2009, he was a Visiting Researcher with the Hydraulic and Maritime Research Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.

An additional leg is added to the basic topology. The main purpose of this leg is to provide the converter with fault-tolerant capabilities. In addition, during normal operation mode, the fourth leg can be used to balance the NP voltage. In this way, the low-frequency voltage oscillations that appear in the NP under some operating conditions are cancelled out effectively. As a result, the modulation strategy of the three main legs of the converter does not have to take care of the voltage balance and can focus on other aspects such as, for instance, minimizing the switching losses of the converter. However, the inclusion of the fourth leg produces some additional losses. A resonant topology is proposed to minimize the switching losses of this leg. Three different fault-tolerant solutions based on the fourth-leg topology are presented. A comparison of these topologies showing their respective advantages and drawbacks is made. Experimental results are presented to show the viability of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2069075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2069075","startPage":"2293","endPage":"2303","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5765746/05556001.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter Solutions Based on Including a Fourth Resonant Leg","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter Solutions Based on Including a Fourth Resonant Leg","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","volume":"58","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556001/","accessionNumber":"11988581","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556001/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-Tolerant Neutral-Point-Clamped Converter Solutions Based on Including a Fourth Resonant Leg","sourcePdf":"tie-ceballos-2069075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083784S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5765746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5765746","articleId":"5556001","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":5556002,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy Thacker","affiliation":["Center of Power Electronics Systems CPES, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5765746/5556002/5556002-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Timothy Thacker (S'00\u2013M'09) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, in 2003.

Therefore, accurate fast-responding PLLs for control and protection purposes are required to provide these measurements. This paper proposes a novel feedback mechanism for single-phase PLL phase detectors using the estimated phase angle. Ripple noise appearing in the estimated frequency, most commonly the second harmonic under phase-lock conditions, is reduced or eliminated without the use of low-pass filters, which can cause delays to occur and limits the overall performance of the PLL response to dynamic changes in the system. The proposed method has the capability to eliminate the noise ripple entirely and, under extreme line distortion conditions, can reduce the ripple by at least half. Other modifications implemented through frequency feedback are shown to decrease the settling time of the PLL up to 50%. Mathematical analyses with the simulated and experimental results are provided to confirm the validity of the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5765746/05556002.pdf","startPage":"2482","endPage":"2490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2069070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2069070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765746","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Locked Loop Noise Reduction via Phase Detector Implementation for Single-Phase Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Noise","Mathematical model","Mixers","Power harmonic filters","Harmonic analysis","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit feedback","circuit noise","frequency estimation","mathematical analysis","phase detectors","phase locked loops","power convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise reduction","single-phase system","grid-connected converter","phase-locked loop","PLL control subsystem","grid voltage frequency","phase angle","feedback mechanism","single-phase PLL phase detector","ripple noise","frequency estimation","second harmonic","phase-lock condition","noise ripple elimination","line distortion","frequency feedback","mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grid interconnection","phase-locked loops (PLLs)","single-phase control","state-variable feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Locked Loop Noise Reduction via Phase Detector Implementation for Single-Phase Systems","volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5556002/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11988582","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Locked Loop Noise Reduction via Phase Detector Implementation for Single-Phase Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-thacker-2069070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095571S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5765746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"5765746","articleId":"5556002","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5556004,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Hao Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5873561/5556004/5556004-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Hao Huang was born in Taichung, Taiwan, in 1982.

Based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model of the TWIP, the FBSC is a structure of a parallel distributed compensator solved by the linear matrix inequality approach. Based on the motion characteristic of the TWIP, the FTPC and the FYSC are designed with Mamdani architecture if-then rules. Furthermore, the fuzzy control scheme for the real TWIP is implemented into an SoPC development board with an embedded reduced-instruction-set-computer soft-core processor and user intellectual property modules.

A key challenge is to achieve near-optimality while keeping the methodology simple. The Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) is suggested as a viable real-time strategy. In this brief, the global optimality of the principle under reasonable assumptions is described from a mathematical viewpoint. Instantaneous optimal control with an appropriate equivalent parameter for battery usage is shown to be possibly a global optimal solution under the assumption that the internal resistance and open-circuit voltage of a battery are independent of the state-of-charge (SOC). This brief also demonstrates that the optimality of the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) results from the close relation of ECMS to the optimal-control-theoretic concept of PMP. In static simulation for a power-split hybrid vehicle, the fuel economy of the vehicle using the control algorithm proposed in this brief is found to be very close-typically within 1%-to the fuel economy through global optimal control that is based on dynamic programming (DP).","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2010.2061232","startPage":"1279","endPage":"1287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5983465/05556022.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2010.2061232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5983465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Control of Hybrid Electric Vehicles Based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Trajectory","Hybrid electric vehicles","Dynamic programming","Fuel economy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","dynamic programming","fuel economy","hybrid electric vehicles","maximum principle","road vehicles","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instantaneous optimal control","hybrid electric vehicles","Pontryagin minimum principle","power management","HEV","state-of-charge","open-circuit voltage","equivalent consumption minimization strategy","ECMS","SOC","fuel economy","dynamic programming","power-split hybrid vehicle","road vehicle control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cost optimal control","dynamic programming (DP)","fuel optimal control","Pontryagin maximum principle","road vehicle control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Control of Hybrid Electric Vehicles Based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle","volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5556022/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","accessionNumber":"12172828","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Control of Hybrid Electric Vehicles Based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle","sourcePdf":"tcst-kim-2061232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079145S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5983465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"447","xplore-issue":"5983465","articleId":"5556022","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":5556024,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Schranzhofer","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/5605856/5556024/5556024-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andreas Schranzhofer (S'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Graz University of Technology, Austria, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Task assignment and processing unit allocation are key steps in the design of predictable and efficient embedded systems. Given the execution modes of applications, we propose a methodology to compute a task to processing element mapping, such that the expected average power consumption is minimized. Changing usage scenarios are represented by varying execution probabilities of modes. Statically precomputed template mappings for each execution probability are stored on the system and applied at runtime, allowing the system to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The underlying model considers static (leakage) and dynamic power. This study shows that deriving approximative solutions with a constant worst-case approximation factor in polynomial time is not achievable unless P = NP, even if a feasible task mapping is provided as an input. A polynomial-time heuristic algorithm is proposed that applies a multiple-step heuristic to derive template mappings. At runtime a manager monitors the system and chooses an appropriate precomputed template, hence low power-consumption is maintained over the systems lifetime. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing the derived solutions to the optimal ones, obtained via an integer linear program (ILP).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/5605856/05556024.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2010.2062192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2010.2062192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5605856","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Power-Aware Mapping of Applications onto Heterogeneous MPSoC Platforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Algorithm design and analysis","Energy consumption","Resource management","System-on-a-chip","Multiprocessing systems","Embedded systems","Automotive electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","integer programming","linear programming","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","power aware computing","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic power aware mapping","heterogeneous MPSoC platforms","multiprocessor SOC","automotive systems","avionic systems","embedded systems","execution probability","worst case approximation factor","integer linear program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic allocation","MPSoC","power-aware allocation","probabilistic applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Power-Aware Mapping of Applications onto Heterogeneous MPSoC Platforms","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5556024/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11629727","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Power-Aware Mapping of Applications onto Heterogeneous MPSoC Platforms","sourcePdf":"tii-schranzhofer-2062192-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090943S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"5605856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5605856","articleId":"5556024","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5556025,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9line Miry","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Institute of Rennes (IETR), National Institute for Applied Sciences, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5568993/5556025/5556025-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["C\u00e9line Miry was born on October 8, 1984.

Typical application fields of the bilateral dual-grid-FDTD are the analysis of transmission between two on-body or implanted antennas. It can also be applied to the computation of specific absorption rate (SAR) in a precise location of the human body. The principle of this method consists in splitting the overall simulation into three FDTD simulations sequentially executed with an appropriate mesh. The radiator is first characterized using a fine mesh. All the elements of the problem are then represented using a coarse mesh. Finally, that element requiring a high resolution is finely described. This approach is applied to the analysis of a 2.4-GHz transmission between two on-body devices and to the computation of the SAR in the fetal brain of a pregnant woman at 900 MHz. The bilateral dual-grid-FDTD technique proves to be accurate compared to FDTD while being fast, stable, and simple to implement.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2058270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5568993/05556025.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2058270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5568993","startPage":"2375","endPage":"2382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Bilateral Dual-Grid-FDTD Approach Applied to On-Body Transmission Analysis and Specific Absorption Rate Computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Bilateral Dual-Grid-FDTD Approach Applied to On-Body Transmission Analysis and Specific Absorption Rate Computation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556025/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11522552","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5556025/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Bilateral Dual-Grid-FDTD Approach Applied to On-Body Transmission Analysis and Specific Absorption Rate Computation","sourcePdf":"tmtt-loison-2058270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060913S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5568993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5568993","articleId":"5556025","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5556033,"authors":[{"name":"Magnus Akke","affiliation":["Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5570058/5556033/5556033-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Magnus Akke (M'91) was born in Lund, Sweden, on July 18, 1961.

The sampling rate remains unchanged, but instead the amplitude of the sample values within a buffer is altered in order to give a signal of the same amplitude but different frequency. The re-calculation of the samples is done by second order spline interpolation. The effect is that the signal frequency appears to be changed to nominal. The algorithm requires knowledge of the frequency, which has to be determined by other means. It can only be used for filters with a finite window length, such as finite-impulse response filters. The proposed algorithm gives a maximum magnitude error of less than 0.1% for frequency deviations up to 10% from nominal. The proposed algorithm does not need any over-sampling and re-sampling to a lower sampling rate. It helps preserve the desired frequency characteristics of filters at off-nominal frequencies. This paper presents a simulation example, which uses an off-nominal test signal of 55 Hz with a 10% second harmonic. The result indicates that this test signal might cause problems for some phasor algorithms, but the proposed sample value adjustment algorithm handles this test case efficiently and complies with Level 1 of IEEE Standard C37.118-2005.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","volume":"25","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11534271","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556033/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sample Value Adjustment Improves Phasor Estimation at Off-Nominal Frequencies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample Value Adjustment Improves Phasor Estimation at Off-Nominal Frequencies","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-makke-2052114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058327S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5570058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5570058","articleId":"5556033","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5556039,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyou He","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5570058/5556039/5556039-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhengyou He (M'10) was born in Sichuan Province, China, in 1970.

The novel technique, called wavelet singular entropy (WSE), incorporates the advantages of the wavelet transform, singular value decomposition, and Shannon entropy. WSE is capable of being immune to the noise in the fault transient and not being affected by the transient magnitude so it can be used to extract features automatically from fault transients and express the fault features intuitively and quantitatively even in the case of high-noise and low-magnitude fault transients. The WSE-based fault detection is performed in this paper, which proves the availability and superiority of WSE technique in fault detection. A novel algorithm based on WSE is put forward for fault classification and it is verified to be effective and reliable under various fault conditions, such as fault type, fault inception time, fault resistance, and fault location. Therefore, the proposed WSE-based fault detection and classification is feasible and has great potential in practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2042624","startPage":"2156","endPage":"2163","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5570058/05556039.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2042624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection and Classification in EHV Transmission Line Based on Wavelet Singular Entropy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Transient analysis","Entropy","Power transmission lines","Singular value decomposition","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","feature extraction","power system faults","power transmission lines","singular value decomposition","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection","EHV transmission line","wavelet singular entropy","fault classification","extremely high-voltage transmission line","fault transients","wavelet transform","singular value decomposition","Shannon entropy","feature extraction","fault type","fault inception time","fault resistance","fault location"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Extremely high-voltage (EHV) transmission line","fault classification","fault detection","singular value decomposition","wavelet singular entropy","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection and Classification in EHV Transmission Line Based on Wavelet Singular Entropy","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5556039/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11534291","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection and Classification in EHV Transmission Line Based on Wavelet Singular Entropy","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-zhe-2042624-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123334S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5570058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"5570058","articleId":"5556039","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":5556048,"authors":[{"name":"Eu-Suk Shim","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eu-Suk","lastName":"Shim","id":"37542813200"},{"name":"Hyoung-Kyu Song","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyoung-Kyu","lastName":"Song","id":"37270117500"},{"name":"Young-Hwan You","affiliation":["UT Communication Research Institute, Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Hwan","lastName":"You","id":"37269122600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"5556048","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":299},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Delay","Frequency estimation","Algorithm design and analysis","Transmitting antennas","Correlation","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","fading channels","frequency estimation","OFDM modulation","set theory","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot subset partitioning","integer frequency offset estimation","cyclic delay diversity","transmit diversity technique","coded OFDM system","multiple transmit antenna","CDD","IFO estimator","frequency selective fading","correlation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyclic delay diversity","frequency offset","frequency selective","OFDM","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"Cyclic delay diversity (CDD) is a simple transmit diversity technique for coded OFDM systems with multiple transmit antennas. However, high frequency selectivity caused by CDD degrades the performance of post- FFT estimation, i.e., integer frequency offset (IFO). This paper suggests a simple way of improving the performance of the IFO estimator based on the pilot subset partitioning which is designed to reduce the effect of frequency selective fading by adopting the CDD. By partitioning uncorrelated pilot subcarriers into subsets to satisfy high correlation, and performing frequency estimation for each pilot subset, a robust IFO estimation scheme is derived. The simulation results show that the proposed method can provide benefit to the overall system performance .","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2010.2065412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5623279/05556048.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2010.2065412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623279","startPage":"564","endPage":"569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Subset Partitioning Based Integer Frequency Offset Estimation for OFDM Systems With Cyclic Delay Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Subset Partitioning Based Integer Frequency Offset Estimation for OFDM Systems With Cyclic Delay Diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556048/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655180","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5556048/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Subset Partitioning Based Integer Frequency Offset Estimation for OFDM Systems With Cyclic Delay Diversity","sourcePdf":"tbc-shim-2065412-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066474S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5623279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5623279","articleId":"5556048","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5556049,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew D.

The proposed system has been developed from a standard pipeline Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC) design, modified to operate as a set of piecewise-linear chaotic maps. The evolution of each map is observed and quantized to obtain a random bit stream. With this approach it is possible to obtain, on current CMOS technology, a data rate in the order of tens of megabit per second. Furthermore, we can also prove that the design is tamper resistant in the sense that a power analysis cannot leak information regarding the generated bits. This makes the proposed circuit perfectly suitable for embedding in cryptographic systems like smarts cards, even more so if one consider that it could be easily obtained by reconfiguring an existing pipeline ADC. The two prototypes have been designed in a 0.35-\u03bcm and 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology, and have a throughput of, respectively, 40 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s.

In this paper, the reliability modeling of PMU is proposed and the proposed model is extended to consider options for the PMU hardware. The Markov process is employed to analyze the proposed model and to present an equivalent two-state model of PMUs. Reliability parameters of PMU are estimated with major difficulties associated with limited and uncertain data. In this paper, uncertainties are taken into account to achieve more realistic estimates of PMU characteristics. Fuzzy sets along with reliability analyses and fuzzy importance measures (FIMs) are utilized as a means of measuring the significance of PMU components on its availability.

The D-ABB is used to compensate for die-to-die (D2D) and within-die (WID) parameter variations, and accordingly, improves the circuit yield regarding the speed, the dynamic power, and the leakage power. The D-ABB circuit consists of threshold voltage estimation circuits and direct control of the body bias performed by on-chip direct controller circuits. Circuit level simulation results of a circuit block case study, extracted from a real microprocessor critical path, referring to an industrial hardware-calibrated 65-nm CMOS technology transistor model, are presented. These results show that the proposed D-ABB reduces the standard deviations of the frequency, the dynamic power, and the leakage power by factors of 5.5\u00d7, 6.4\u00d7, and 4.5\u00d7, respectively, when both D2D and WID variations are considered. In addition, in the presented case study, initial total yields of 16.8% and 13% are improved to 100% and 91.4%, respectively. The proposed D-ABB circuit exhibits lower area overhead compared to the other ABB circuits reported in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Low Area Overhead Direct Adaptive Body

The proposed buried-channel VG NAND allows better X, Y pitch scaling and is a very attractive candidate for ultra high-density 3D stackable NAND Flash.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556199/","conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11488281","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5556199/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A highly scalable 8-layer 3D vertical-gate (VG) TFT NAND Flash using junction-free buried channel BE-SONOS device","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly scalable 8-layer 3D vertical-gate (VG) TFT NAND Flash using junction-free buried channel BE-SONOS device","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"t12p4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053878S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548927","isNumber":"5556114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548927","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5556114","articleId":"5556199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5556201,"authors":[{"name":"P.

reliability of 3-D NAND cells fabricated by TCAT (Terabit Cell Array Transistor) technology have been improved significantly via a damascened metal gates and a controlled offset between BL contact and

The damascened metal gate providing sufficiently low resistance is achieved by adopting a novel metal process. Highly suppressed disturbance property is achieved by the appropriate offset which reduces the leakage current through the select transistor. It is proved that the TCAT NAND is a manufacturable technology in terms of reliability as well as performance in a channel hole with a diameter of 90nm.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2010.5556216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2010.5556216","publicationTitle":"2010 Symposium on VLSI Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Symposium on VLSI Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548927/5556114/05556216.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Highly reliable vertical NAND technology with biconcave shaped storage layer and leakage controllable offset structure","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11488301","htmlLink":"/document/5556216/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly reliable vertical NAND technology with biconcave shaped storage layer and leakage controllable offset structure","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"t16p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081672S","chronDate":"15-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548927","isNumber":"5556114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548927","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5556114","articleId":"5556216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5556222,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, we present a set of new ultrafast optical techniques and devices that have been developed over the last five years for long-term stable femtosecond synchronization of large-scale X-ray FELs. These techniques are based on the availability of ultra-low timing jitter optical pulse trains available from mode-locked lasers that serve as timing signals to be distributed via timing-stabilized fiber links to end-stations where tight synchronization is required. At the end-stations, optical and RF sub-systems are synchronized with the delivered timing signals. Using these techniques, we demonstrate experimentally that remotely located lasers and microwave sources in facilities, a few hundred meters in extent, can be synchronized with few femtosecond accuracy over typical uninterrupted operating periods of FELs, i.e. > 10 hours. The limitation to femtosecond accuracy is due to the quantum noise of currently employed femtosecond fiber lasers and can be overcome in the future, with improved noise performance of femtosecond lasers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond precision timing distribution for accelerators and Light Sources","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.2010.5556266","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548419/5556172/05556266.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.2010.5556266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond precision timing distribution for accelerators and Light Sources","conferenceDate":"1-4 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556266/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11488120","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond precision timing distribution for accelerators and Light Sources","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1216217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075746S","chronDate":"1-4 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548419","isNumber":"5556172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548419","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5556172","articleId":"5556266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5556363,"authors":[{"name":"Enrico Rubiola","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9, Besancon, France"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Rubiola","id":"37268316800"},{"name":"Rodolphe Boudot","affiliation":["FEMTO-ST Institute, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9, Besancon, France"],"firstName":"Rodolphe","lastName":"Boudot","id":"37397499900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6401-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6399-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6400-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-1949"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-1914"},{"format":"CD","value":"1075-6787"}],"articleNumber":"5556363","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":860},"abstract":"The amplifier phase noise is a critical issue in numerous fields of engineering and physics, like oscillators, frequency synthesis, telecommunications, radars, spectroscopy, in the emerging domain of microwave photonics, and in more exotic domains like radio astronomy, particle accelerators, etc. We analyze the two main types of phase noise in amplifiers, white and flicker. Using the polynomial model, the phase-noise power spectral density is S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03c6</sub>\n(f) = b\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n + b\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sub>\n/f. Phase noise results from adding white noise to the RF spectrum around the carrier. For a given amount of RF noise added, 60 is proportional to the inverse of the carrier power P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n. By contrast, b\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sub>\n is a constant parameter of the amplifier, in a wide range of carrier power. Accordingly, the flicker phase noise b\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sub>\n/f is independent of P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n. This fact has amazing consequences on different amplifier topologies. Connecting m equal amplifiers in parallel, b\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sub>\n is 1/m times that of one device.

Recirculating the signal in an amplifier so that the gain increases by a power of m (a factor of m in dB) due to positive feedback (regeneration), which for integer m is similar to the case of m amplifiers, we find that b\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sub>\n is m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n times that of the amplifier alone. The simplest model for the 1/f phase noise is that the near-dc 1/f noise phase-modulates the carrier through some parametric effect in the semiconductor. This model predicts the behavior of the (simple) amplifier and of the different amplifier topologies. Numerous measurements on amplifiers from different technologies and frequencies (HF to microwaves), also including some obsolete amplifiers, validate the theory. This model also applies to other devices, including passive components.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Microwave integrated circuits","Gain","Microwave oscillators","Microwave FET integrated circuits","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1/f noise","flicker noise","microwave amplifiers","network topology","phase noise","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF amplifiers","microwave amplifiers","amplifier phase noise","white noise","flicker","amplifier topologies","1/f phase noise"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FREQ.2010.5556363","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548419/5556172/05556363.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.2010.5556363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase noise in RF and microwave amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase noise in RF and microwave amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556363/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556363/","accessionNumber":"11488209","conferenceDate":"1-4 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase noise in RF and microwave amplifiers","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0226115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042396S","chronDate":"1-4 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548419","isNumber":"5556172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548419","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5556172","articleId":"5556363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5556365,"authors":[{"name":"Laura B.

Our measurement approach takes advantage of a commercially-available, high-dynamic-range analog-to-digital converter driven by a high-performance clock to digitize the signal-under-test with high fidelity. Following digitization, phase and amplitude fluctuations are extracted and converted to PM and AM noise spectra. Measurement of microwave signals is accomplished by the inclusion of a specially-designed low-noise down-converter to translate the signal frequency to the VHF regime while introducing minimal additional signal noise. Measurements made on this system are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained using a conventional heterodyne mixer system. In addition to speeding the characterization of RF sources by simultaneously measuring both PM and AM signal characteristics, the digital noise measurement approach allows the direct measurement of the PM- and AM-noise spectra of more complex signals, such as pulsed CW waveforms, in both the VHF and microwave regimes.","doi":"10.1109/FREQ.2010.5556365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FREQ.2010.5556365","startPage":"97","endPage":"102","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5548419/5556172/05556365.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous digital measurement of phase and amplitude noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous digital measurement of phase and amplitude noise","conferenceDate":"1-4 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556365/","accessionNumber":"11488211","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556365/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous digital measurement of phase and amplitude noise","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0206170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043917S","chronDate":"1-4 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5548419","isNumber":"5556172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5548419","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5556172","articleId":"5556365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5556408,"authors":[{"name":"Shahrzad Naraghi","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Cirrus Logic, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5556407/5556408/5556408-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahrzad Naraghi (S'04\u2013M'08) received the B.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, the M.Sc. degree from the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, and the Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2009, all in electrical engineering.","She held a summer research position at the IBM T.

Experimental result verifies that the proposed LDO is stable for a capacitive load from 0 to 50 pF (estimated equivalent parasitic capacitance from load circuits) and with load capability of 100 mA. Moreover, the gain-enhanced structure provides sufficient loop gain to improve line regulation to 3.78 mV/V and load regulation to 0.1 mV/mA, respectively.

This paper presents a high-speed low-power SRAM that employs three power supplies (1, 2, and 3.3 V). A 1-V power supply is mainly used in the SRAM core to save standby and/or active power, while a 2-V supply is used in critical components to realize high performance. The voltage applicable to each MOSFET is up to 2.2 V because of the use of a 5-nm ultrathin gate oxide, and so the 3.3-V power supply is used only for LV-TTL level I/O buffers. Secure write operation for 1-V six-transistor memory cells is guaranteed by using a new switched powerline impedance scheme. To reduce dynamic write power dissipation, a segmented bitline scheme is adopted and long global bitlines are assigned to the 4th (topmost) metal layer. The data stored in memory cells are read out via virtual-GND lines by sensing the change in current volume. The practical use of parasitic bipolar action in SOI MOSFETs is being actively considered as a way of obtaining a large read current from memory cells.

In this study, dual-band telemetry is adopted to achieve both high power efficiency and high data rate. Frequencies of 2 and 22 MHz are chosen for power and data carrier frequencies, respectively. A mixed-mode and multiple-voltage design is applied to the stimulator for withstanding a high-compliance voltage of \u00b1 10 V at the output stage as well as for reducing the area of each pixel. To add flexibility to the stimulator, each pixel has a local digital controller, which enables the stimulator IC to generate 256 parallel stimulations with various pulse widths and amplitudes.

Each CAB has a wide variety of subcircuits ranging in granularity from multipliers and programmable offset wide-linear-range Gm blocks to nMOS and pMOS transistors. The programmable interconnects and circuit elements in the CAB are implemented using floating-gate (FG) transistors, the total number of which exceeds fifty thousand. Using FG devices eliminates the need for SRAM to store configuration bits since the switch stores its own configuration. This system exhibits significant performance enhancements over its predecessor in terms of achievable dynamic range (> 9 b of FG voltage) and speed (\u2248 20 gates/s) of accurate FG current programming and isolation between ON and OFF switches. An improved routing fabric has been designed that includes nearest neighbor connections to minimize the penalty on bandwidth due to routing parasitic. A maximum bandwidth of 57 MHz through the switch matrix and around 5 MHz for a first-order low-pass filter is achievable on this chip, the limitation being a \u201cprogram\u201d mode switch that will be rectified in the next chip. Programming performance improved drastically by implementing the entire algorithm on-chip with an SPI digital interface. Measured results of the individual subcircuits and two system examples including an AM receiver and a speech processor are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Floating-Gate-Based Field-Programmable Analog Array","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2056832","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5556407/05556427.pdf","startPage":"1781","endPage":"1794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2056832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556407","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556427/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Floating-Gate-Based Field-Programmable Analog Array","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5556427/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11487080","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Floating-Gate-Based Field-Programmable Analog Array","sourcePdf":"jssc-basu-2056832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099974S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5556407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5556407","articleId":"5556427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5556429,"authors":[{"name":"James Ayers","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5556407/5556429/5556429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["James Ayers (S'00\u2013M'10) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Oregon State University, Corvallis, in 2002, 2004, and 2010, respectively.","His research interest is in analog, mixed-signal, and RF IC design for low-power applications.

A multiturn loop-dipole structure with inductive and resistive stubs is chosen for both antennas. Using these on-chip antennas, the chip employs asymmetric communication links: at downlink, the tag captures the required supply wirelessly from the received RF signal transmitted by a reader and, for the uplink, ultra-wideband impulse-radio (UWB-IR), in the 3.1-10.6-GHz band, is employed instead of backscattering to achieve extremely low power and a high data rate up to 1 Mb/s. At downlink with the on-chip power-scavenging antenna and power-management unit circuitry properly designed, 7.5-cm powering distance has been achieved, which is a huge improvement in terms of operation distance compared with other reported tags with on-chip antenna. Also, 7-cm operating distance is achieved with the implemented on-chip UWB antenna. The tag can be powered up at all the three ISM bands of 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz, with off-chip antennas, and 5.8 GHz with the integrated on-chip antenna. The tag receives its clock and the commands wirelessly through the modulated RF powering-up signal. Measurement results show that the tag can operate up to 1 Mb/s data rate with a minimum input power of -19.41 dBm at 915-MHz band, corresponding to 15.7 m of operation range with an off-chip 0-dB gain antenna. This is a great improvement compared with conventional passive RFIDs in term of data rate and operation distance. The power consumption of the chip is measured to be just 16.6 \u03bcW at the clock frequency of 10 MHz at 1.2-V supply. In addition, in this paper, for the first time, the radiation pattern of an on-chip antenna at such a frequency is measured. The measurement shows that the antenna has an almost omnidirectional radiation pattern so that the chip's performance is less direction-dependent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556446/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","volume":"45","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"11487083","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556446/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Far-Field On-Chip Antennas Monolithically Integrated in a Wireless-Powered 5.8-GHz Downlink/UWB Uplink RFID Tag in 0.18-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> Standard CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Far-Field On-Chip Antennas Monolithically Integrated in a Wireless-Powered 5.8-GHz Downlink/UWB Uplink RFID Tag in 0.18-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> Standard CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-radiom-2055630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097644S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5556407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5556407","articleId":"5556446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5556447,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyu Ru","affiliation":["IC Design Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5556407/5556447/5556447-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiyu Ru (S'05-M'10) received the B.Eng. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree from Lund University, Lund, Sweden, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, in 2009, all in electrical engineering.","In 2003, he was a software design engineer with Z-Com, Nanjing, China, working on WLAN products.

Simulation shows a wideband 90\u00b0 phase shift between I and Q outputs without systematic channel bandwidth limitation. Oversampling and harmonic rejection relaxes RF pre-filtering and reduces noise and interference folding.

The VCO is sampled by the reference clock without using a frequency divider and an amplitude controlled charge pump is used which is inherently insensitive to mismatch. The main remaining source of the VCO reference spur is the periodic disturbance of the VCO by the sampling at the reference frequency. The underlying VCO sampling spur mechanisms are analyzed and their effect is minimized by using dummy samplers and isolation buffers. A duty-cycle-controlled reference buffer and delay-locked loop (DLL) tuning are proposed to further reduce the worst case spur level. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spur reduction techniques, a 2.21 GHz PLL is designed and fabricated in 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS technology. While using a high loop-bandwidth-to-reference-frequency ratio of 1/20, the reference spur measured from 20 chips is <; -80 dBc. The PLL consumes 3.8 mW while the in-band phase noise is -121 dBc/Hz at 200 kHz and the output jitter integrated from 10 kHz to 100 MHz is 0.3ps\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2010.2053094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2010.2053094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5556407/05556453.pdf","startPage":"1809","endPage":"1821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spur Reduction Techniques for Phase-Locked Loops Exploiting A Sub-Sampling Phase Detector","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spur Reduction Techniques for Phase-Locked Loops Exploiting A Sub-Sampling Phase Detector","volume":"45","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556453/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11487070","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556453/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spur Reduction Techniques for Phase-Locked Loops Exploiting A Sub-Sampling Phase Detector","sourcePdf":"45jssc09-xgao-2053094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115724S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5556407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5556407","articleId":"5556453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5556455,"authors":[{"name":"Jongwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5556407/5556455/5556455-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jongwoo Lee (S'03\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","Prior to beginning his graduate studies, he was an operation/research officer (1st Lt.) in the Ministry of Nation Defense in Korea for two and half years.

Due to the starting requirements, motor manufacturers are forced to employ high resistivity rotor bars which lead to higher losses and lower motor efficiency. This paper will show that AFD offer the advantage of decreasing the energy consumption by eliminating the constraints of starting requirements. Short rise time voltage pulses produced by AFD may adversely affect the stator winding insulation and accelerate its aging process. The paper will discuss how motor manufacturers have addressed this problem by introducing surge resistant insulation materials, turn insulation and reinforced ground insulation. The voltage waveform harmonics of an AFD could also lead to higher motor temperature rise. Therefore, additional thermal consideration should be given. The paper will review the new IEC standards which define the stator winding insulation requirement when the induction motor operates with AFD. Another aspect discussed in the paper, related to the design of an induction motor coupled with an AFD, is how to minimize the magnetic noise that may be generated if higher frequency voltage harmonics are present in the AFD.","doi":"10.1109/PAPCON.2010.5556503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PAPCON.2010.5556503","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of 2010 Annual Pulp & Paper Industry Technical Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of 2010 Annual Pulp & Paper Industry Technical Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547549/5556496/05556503.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specific design considerations for AC induction motors connected to adjustable frequency drives","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Specific design considerations for AC induction motors connected to adjustable frequency drives","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11498501","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556503/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specific design considerations for AC induction motors connected to adjustable frequency drives","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"SpecificDesignConsiderationsforACInductionMoto.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07105S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547549","isNumber":"5556496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547549","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5556496","articleId":"5556503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5556538,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Pai Lu","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wen-Pai","lastName":"Lu","id":"37537000600"},{"name":"Henry Leung","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Henry","lastName":"Leung","id":"37530640800"},{"name":"Enrique Estrada","affiliation":["Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Enrique","lastName":"Estrada","id":"37528828400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6376-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6374-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6375-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5556538","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":293},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Multiprotocol label switching","Facsimile","TV","Biomedical monitoring","Monitoring","Wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical telemetry","computer centres","health care","teleconferencing","telemedicine","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rural communities","urban communities","telemedicine 2.0","quality healthcare","intelligent transport","high definition videoconferencing","high quality video telemetry","audio telemetry","data center"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Telemedicine","High Definition","Videoconference","Healthcare","Telemetry","QoS"]}],"abstract":"Providing quality healthcare in both rural and urban settings introduces many challenges.

The performance gap between the execution speed of security software and the amount of data to be processed is ever widening. A common solution to close this performance gap is through hardware implementation of security functions. Possessing the flexibility of software and high parallelism of hardware, reconfigurable hardware devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), have become increasingly popular for this purpose. FPGAs support the performance demands of security operations as well as enable architectural and algorithm innovations in the future. This paper presents a survey of the state-of-art in FPGA-based implementations that have been used in the network infrastructure security area, categorizing currently existing diverse implementations. Combining brief descriptions with intensive case-studies, we hope this survey will inspire more active research in this area.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/6065679/05556740.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on the Application of FPGAs for Network Infrastructure Security","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6065679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.072210.00075","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on the Application of FPGAs for Network Infrastructure Security","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2011","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2011","accessionNumber":"12359779","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5556740/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on the Application of FPGAs for Network Infrastructure Security","sourcePdf":"03chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187362S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6065679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6065679","articleId":"5556740","onlineDate":"23 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":5556757,"authors":[{"name":"Suriza Ahmad Zabidi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Suriza Ahmad","lastName":"Zabidi","id":"37547499500"},{"name":"Wajdi Al Khateeb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wajdi Al","lastName":"Khateeb","id":"37085928355"},{"name":"Md.

The unlicensed, higher speed, broader and unlimited bandwidth, low cost solutions, and shortest deployment time frame are some of the drive to deploy FSO. However, weather attenuation has a big impact on the transmission line of FSO. There are a lot of studies and experiments have been done on FSO in the temperate climate region where the attenuation due to snow and fog are the two major problems in the deployment of FSO. However, there are no comprehensive study is done for the deployment of FSO in the tropical climate region where the rain and haze are present throughout the year. The objective of this paper is to produce analysis result of the different weather attenuations that have effect on FSO link. The parameters are attenuation due to geometric, molecular, atmospheric, rain, haze, and scintillation. The parameters are used to evaluate link availability of the FSO link. The result of the evaluation can provide more knowledge on the feasibility of FSO deployment under tropical weather condition especially for a long range link.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556757","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535008/5556742/05556757.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556742","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of weather on free space optics communication (FSO) under tropical weather conditions and a proposed setup for measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The effect of weather on free space optics communication (FSO) under tropical weather conditions and a proposed setup for measurement","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556757/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11497751","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5556757/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of weather on free space optics communication (FSO) under tropical weather conditions and a proposed setup for measurement","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"72C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089951S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535008","isNumber":"5556742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535008","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5556742","articleId":"5556757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5556769,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Tahir","affiliation":["ECE Department, International Islamic University Malaysia, Gombak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Tahir","id":"37063874700"},{"name":"Akhmad Unggul Priantoro","affiliation":["ECE Department, International Islamic University Malaysia, Gombak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Akhmad Unggul","lastName":"Priantoro","id":"37266535200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6235-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6233-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6234-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5556769","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":511},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bandwidth","Doppler effect","Bit error rate","Receivers","Frequency synchronization","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency division multiple access","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","mobile communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER analysis","variable subcarrier bandwidth OFDMA systems","multipath propagation impairment","multirate data services","ICI reduction","intercarrier interference","frequency offset","Doppler spread","VSB-OFDMA systems","mix-mobility environment","computer simulation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","BER","Doppler spread","ICI"]}],"abstract":"OFDMA is the preferred multiple access technique to provide high data rate services in mobile environment due its resilience against multipath propagation impairment and flexibility to provide multi-rate data services. However, it also has issue with susceptibility to ICI (inter-carrier interference) caused by frequency offset and Doppler spread due to mobility. Thus, OFDMA with certain number of sub-carriers will only be optimum over a certain range of mobility. Recently, a VSB-OFDMA (variable sub-carrier OFDMA), system has been proposed to relax the effect of ICI. Although it suffers from non-orthogonality caused by different sub-carrier sizes, as ICI is inversely proportional to the sub-carrier bandwidth, it rakes in benefit from reduced ICI in mix-mobility environment. It has been shown to produce higher system capacity under mix-mobility environment. In this paper we have performed comparison based on computer simulation to gauge the advantage offered by VSB-OFDMA in terms of BER.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556769","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535008/5556742/05556769.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556742","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER analysis of variable sub-carrier bandwidth OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BER analysis of variable sub-carrier bandwidth OFDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556769/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11497761","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5556769/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER analysis of variable sub-carrier bandwidth OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"377C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044271S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535008","isNumber":"5556742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535008","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5556742","articleId":"5556769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5556776,"authors":[{"name":"Lillian Y.

The existing FDEs are designed with the assumption of additive white Gaussian noise. Although the assumption is quite proper for a variety of applications, it has been revealed that many background noises arising in the reality are with non-Gaussian statistics. In this paper, we show that the Gaussian-based FDEs fare poorly in non-Gaussian noise environment. To achieve reliable data transmission in frequency-selective multiple-access channel with unknown non-Gaussian noise, we propose a robust adaptive FDE which consists of a nonlinear preprocessing front-end followed by a linear adaptive FDE. The nonlinear front-end adapts itself to the unknown non-Gaussian noise to suppress the impulses while the FDE effectively removes the MAI. Results from the simulation reveal that the proposed robust FDE is able to perform successfully in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556776","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535008/5556742/05556776.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive frequency-domain equalization for DS-CDMA in non-Gaussian noise channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556776/","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive frequency-domain equalization for DS-CDMA in non-Gaussian noise channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11497764","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556776/","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive frequency-domain equalization for DS-CDMA in non-Gaussian noise channels","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"369C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059793S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535008","isNumber":"5556742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535008","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5556742","articleId":"5556776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5556779,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid A.

On the other hand, if the CP length is shorter than the Channel Impulse Response (CIR), the system performance is limited by the Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) and Inter Carrier Interference (ICI).

Despite its importance, statistical rainfall forecasting, especially for long-term, has been proven to be a great challenge due to the dynamic nature of climate phenomena and random fluctuations involved in the process. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have recently become very popular and they are one of the most widely used forecasting models that have enjoyed fruitful applications for forecasting purposes in many domains of engineering and computer science. The main contribution of this research is in the design, implementation and comparison of rainfall forecasting models using Focused Time-Delay Neural Networks (FTDNN). The optimal parameters of the neural network architectures were obtained from experiments while networks were trained to perform one-step-ahead predictions. The daily rainfall dataset, obtained from Malaysia Meteorological Department (MMD), was converted to monthly, biannually, quarterly and monthly datasets. Training and testing were performed on each of the datasets and corresponding accuracies of the forecasts were measured using Mean Absolute Percent Error. For testing data, results indicate that yearly rainfall dataset gives the most accurate forecasts (94.25%). As future work, more parameters such as temperature, humidity and sunshine data can be incorporated into the neural network for superior forecasting performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556806","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535008/5556742/05556806.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rainfall forecasting models using focused time-delay neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Testing","Accuracy","Forecasting","Training data","Training","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","neural nets","rain","statistical analysis","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rainfall forecasting model","focused time-delay neural networks","strategic planning","agriculture-dependent countries","statistical rainfall forecasting","climate phenomena","random fluctuations","artificial neural networks","neural network architecture","daily rainfall dataset","mean absolute percent error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["rainfall","forecasting","neural networks","dynamic systems","focused time delay neural networks","statistical forecasting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Rainfall forecasting models using focused time-delay neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556806/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11497797","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rainfall forecasting models using focused time-delay neural networks","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"28C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06713S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535008","isNumber":"5556742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535008","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5556742","articleId":"5556806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5556807,"authors":[{"name":"Hesham A.

The eavesdropper performance is based on observing the authorized transmitted signal based on classical detection theory. The eavesdropper taps a coded transmission of a particular user and performs the necessary calculations to derive the transmitter's code word from these transmissions. If an eavesdropper could be forced to tap code pulses with low SNRs, a security enhancement can be obtained. An eavesdropper would need SNR of 9.2 dB to correctly detect encoded pulses with a probability of 50 % for the hybrid scheme, which is 5 and 3 dB higher than M-sequence and EDW schemes respectively. The difference in performance of the eavesdropper's receiver with envelope detection is getting small, especially at higher SNRs.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535008/5556742/05556807.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security enhancement for spectral amplitude coding OCDMA based on hybrid EDW/M seq. code systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical pulses","Multiaccess communication","Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Adaptive optics","Security","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","m-sequences","optical fibre networks","probability","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security enhancement","spectral amplitude coding","OCDMA","EDW-M sequence code systems","optical CDMA","eavesdropper probability","error-free code detection","enhancement double weight scheme","hybrid code system","classical detection theory","encoded pulse detection","eavesdropper receiver","envelope detection","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectral amplitude coding","optical cdma","enhanced double weight","M-sequence","SNR","eavesdropper"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Security enhancement for spectral amplitude coding OCDMA based on hybrid EDW/M seq. code systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11497799","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security enhancement for spectral amplitude coding OCDMA based on hybrid EDW/M seq. code systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"265C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068421S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535008","isNumber":"5556742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535008","xplore-issue":"5556742","articleId":"5556807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5556811,"authors":[{"name":"H.

OptiSystem Ver.7 has been used for simulation on system's performance. It is possible since the code properties posses' one clean signal chip for each of the channels. Subsequently, phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) is suppressed at the receiver, thus the system performance is improved in term of signal to noise ratio and bit error rate.

Traditional information security systems use a password or personal identification number (PIN). This means they can be easily accessed by unauthorized persons without access being noticed. This paper addresses the issue of enhancing such systems using keystroke biometrics as a translucent level of user authentication. The paper focuses on using the time interval (key down-down) between keystrokes as a feature of individuals' typing patterns to recognize authentic users and reject imposters. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with a Back Propagation (BP) learning algorithm is used to train and validate the features. The results are compared with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network and several distance classifier method used in literature based on Equal Error Rate (EER).","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556852","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535008/5556742/05556852.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of keystroke biometrics authentication system using artificial neural network (ANN) and distance classifier method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance of keystroke biometrics authentication system using artificial neural network (ANN) and distance classifier method","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11497723","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5556852/","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of keystroke biometrics authentication system using artificial neural network (ANN) and distance classifier method","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"15C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055903S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535008","isNumber":"5556742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535008","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5556742","articleId":"5556852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5556858,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We propose a scheme that provides security based on transforming the basic signal constellation to a higher order signal constellation with the help of conventional encryption method and then using channel knowledge (i.e. amplitude and phase variation), which is location specific, to distort the constellation of encrypted data. This scheme not only makes the estimation of the constellation difficult but also the type of modulation that is used for the adversary. BER (bit error rate) is used as performance metric. We find that the adversary suffers from high BER as compared to its legitimate counterpart.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5535008/5556742/05556862.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556862","doi":"10.1109/ICCCE.2010.5556862","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE'10)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5556862","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Receivers","Constellation diagram","Encryption","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","error statistics","fading channels","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless physical layer security","channel state information","secure communication","fading wireless medium","higher-order signal constellation","encryption method","channel knowledge","BER","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel reciprocity","encryption","signal constellation","fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556862/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless physical layer security using channel state information","accessionNumber":"11497729","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5556862/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless physical layer security using channel state information","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"129C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058231S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535008","isNumber":"5556742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535008","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5556742","articleId":"5556862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5556865,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Evolutionary Strategy helps to solve such real world problems efficiently and quickly. But sequential Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) require an enormous computation power to solve such problems and it takes much time to solve large problems. To enhance the performance for solving this type of problems, this paper presents a new Distributed Novel Evolutionary Strategy Algorithm (DNESA) for Multi-Objective Optimization. The proposed DNESA applies the divide-and-conquer approach to decompose population into smaller sub-population and involves multiple solutions in the form of cooperative sub-populations. In DNESA, the server distributes the total computation load to all associate clients and simulation results show that the time for solving large problems is much less than sequential EAs. Also DNESA shows better performance in convergence test when compared with other three well-known EAs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5556865/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11497736","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5556865/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","conferenceDate":"11-12 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new distributed evolutionary computation technique for Multi-Objective Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new distributed evolutionary computation technique for Multi-Objective Optimization","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"11C.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072111S","chronDate":"11-12 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5535008","isNumber":"5556742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5535008","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5556742","articleId":"5556865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5556867,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed El Sanhoury","affiliation":["Computer Science Department KICT, IIUM University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"El Sanhoury","id":"37547936800"},{"name":"Ahmed Hassan Mabrouk","affiliation":["Computer Science Department KICT, IIUM University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ahmed Hassan","lastName":"Mabrouk","id":"37966377800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6235-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6233-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6234-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5556867","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":173},"abstract":"In this paper, we examine an enhancement of pulsed Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (pulsed MB-OFDM) systems for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) applications. The pulsed MB-OFDM system offers an efficient option for fulfilling the UWB high bandwidth channel requirements. This system combines the two major implementations of UWB, namely the impulse radio and the MB-OFDM, in order to capture the advantages of low hardware complexity and low power consumption in both implementations. A modified half-rate Algebraic Time Frequency (ATF) coding will be used to achieve the proposed enhancement of the pulsed system. This enhancement will result in energy efficiency, i.e. SNR vs. SER, improvement which is particularly useful for SAR systems operating under heavy clutter. Improvements in energy efficiency are tested under different UWB channel models. Simulation results are shown to establish these improvements.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering

HDFS has been utilized in BlueSky, one of the most prevalent e-Learning resource sharing systems in China, to store and share courseware majorly in the form of PowerPoint (PPT) files and video clips. Unfortunately, HDFS does not perform well for massive small files since huge numbers of small files imposed heavy burden on NameNode of HDFS, correlations between files were not considered for data placement, and no prefetching mechanism was provided to improve I/O performance. This paper introduces a novel approach to improve the efficiency of storing and accessing small files on HDFS. Characteristics of file correlations and access locality remaining among small files in the context of courseware are well considered for storing and accessing them. Firstly, all correlated small files of a PPT courseware are merged into a larger file to reduce the metadata burden on NameNode. Secondly, a two-level prefetching mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of accessing small files. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is able to effectively mitigate the load of NameNode and to improve the efficiency of storing and accessing massive small files on HDFS.","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2010.72","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5556873/5557194/05557216.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2010.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach to Improving the Efficiency of Storing and Accessing Small Files on Hadoop: A Case Study by PowerPoint Files","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557216/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to Improving the Efficiency of Storing and Accessing Small Files on Hadoop: A Case Study by PowerPoint Files","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11502975","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557216/","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to Improving the Efficiency of Storing and Accessing Small Files on Hadoop: A Case Study by PowerPoint Files","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4126a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065254S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5556873","isNumber":"5557194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5556873","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5557194","articleId":"5557216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5557272,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Mi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Mi","id":"37529794800"},{"name":"Huaimin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Huaimin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292557700"},{"name":"Gang Yin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Yin","id":"37411347800"},{"name":"Yangfan Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yangfan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37288682700"},{"name":"Dianxi Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Dianxi","lastName":"Shi","id":"37401070600"},{"name":"Lin Yuan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China","School of Electronic Technology, Information and Engineering University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37531504600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8147-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4126-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5557272","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":98,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Virtual machine monitors","Encoding","Cloud computing","Energy consumption","Smoothing methods","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","energy conservation","genetic algorithms","Internet","resource allocation","self-adjusting systems","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data center","virtual machine","physical machine","online self-reconfiguration approach","Brown quadratic exponential smoothing","genetic algorithm","optimal reconfiguration policy","resource utilization","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing Data Center","Energy Consumption","Virtualization","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In a typical large-scale data center, a set of applications are hosted over virtual machines (VMs) running on a large number of physical machines (PMs). Such a virtualization technique can be used for conserving power consumption by minimizing the number of PMs that should be turned on according to the application requirements to resource. However, the resource demands for VMs is dynamic in nature since the number of user requests the applications should handle is rapidly changing in practice. It is a great challenge to online reconfigure the VMs (i.e., optimize the number and the locations for the VMs) according to the dynamic resource demands. Especially for the emerging applications of large-scale data centers for cloud computing systems, existing approaches either fails to find a best configuration of VMs or cannot produce a result in an acceptable time. In this paper, we propose an online self-reconfiguration approach for reallocating VMs in large-scale data centers. It first accurately predicts the future workloads of the applications with Brown's quadratic exponential smoothing. Based on such a prediction, it adopts a genetic algorithm to efficiently find the optimal reconfiguration policy. The resource utilization of large-scale cloud computing data centers can thus be improved and their energy consumption can be greatly conserved. We conduct extensive experiments and the results verify that our approach can effectively switch off more unnecessary running PMs comparing with current approaches without a performance degradation of the whole system.","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2010.69","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5556873/5557194/05557272.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2010.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557194","startPage":"514","endPage":"521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Self-Reconfiguration with Performance Guarantee for Energy-Efficient Large-Scale Cloud Computing Data Centers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Online Self-Reconfiguration with Performance Guarantee for Energy-Efficient Large-Scale Cloud Computing Data Centers","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557272/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11503021","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5557272/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Self-Reconfiguration with Performance Guarantee for Energy-Efficient Large-Scale Cloud Computing Data Centers","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4126a514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078358S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5556873","isNumber":"5557194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5556873","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5557194","articleId":"5557272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":5557374,"authors":[{"name":"Chaolong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computation Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chaolong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533371800"},{"name":"Wensi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Computation Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wensi","lastName":"Ding","id":"37528820100"},{"name":"Fengjian Yang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fengjian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37405692900"},{"name":"Yanshan Zeng","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanshan","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37531478000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8231-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5557374","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557374","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Stability criteria","Delay","Asymptotic stability","Lyapunov method","Mathematical model","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","content-addressable storage","delays","Lyapunov methods","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global exponential stability","BAM","delay","piecewise Lyapunov function","bidirectional associative memory","linear impulsive neural networks","impulsive controllers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["impulsive","neural networks","globally exponentially stability","Lyapunov function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISECS.2010.82","pdfPath":"/iel5/5556871/5557090/05557374.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Third International Symposium on Electronic Commerce and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Third International Symposium on Electronic Commerce and Security","startPage":"343","endPage":"346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISECS.2010.82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global Exponential Stability of a General Class of BAM Neural Networks with Impulsive and Delay","abstract":"By piecewise Lyapunov function , a general class of bidirectional associative memory with impulsive and delay is studied.Several global exponential stability criteria of the equilibrium point are established.Two linear impulsive neural networks with delays are constructed, which can be used to design impulsive controllers to control the exponential stability of the system.

In this paper, we propose a method by adding a set of register and a random generator to defend DPA attack. The proposed method has been implemented on SASEBO board.

According to the analysis of the criterion, it is shown that the multiplexed users with high channel gain but low correlation with each other may bring high system capacity. For the limited feedback scenario, we design the user preselection scheme and the quantized feedback of the users' channel vectors. The preselection scheme, taking advantages of threshold and the norm of inner product of the channel vector with orthogonal random beamforming, significantly reduces the feedback load and preserves the tradeoff between the channel gain and correlation of users. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has much higher capacity but lower feedback load compared with existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICAEE.2010.5557560","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Energy Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Energy Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547543/5557532/05557560.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAEE.2010.5557560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission with linear precoding and limited feedback in multiuser MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557560","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557560/","displayDocTitle":"Transmission with linear precoding and limited feedback in multiuser MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11499684","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557560/","conferenceDate":"19-20 June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission with linear precoding and limited feedback in multiuser MIMO systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061523S","chronDate":"19-20 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547543","isNumber":"5557532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547543","xplore-issue":"5557532","articleId":"5557560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5557589,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Uthitsunthorn","affiliation":["Power System Research Unit, Suranaree University of Technology, THAILAND"],"lastName":"Dusit Uthitsunthorn","id":"38479428300"},{"name":"Thanatchai Kulworawanichpong","affiliation":["Power System Research Unit, Suranaree University of Technology, THAILAND"],"firstName":"Thanatchai","lastName":"Kulworawanichpong","id":"37394155800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7832-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7829-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7830-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5557589","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":533},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557589","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Computational modeling","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","overcurrent protection","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal overcurrent relay coordination","genetic algorithms","intelligent approach","powerful search scheme","6-bus power system","digital overcurrent relays","efficient nonlinear quasi-Newton method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAEE.2010.5557589","pdfPath":"/iel5/5547543/5557532/05557589.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Energy Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Advances in Energy Engineering","startPage":"162","endPage":"165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAEE.2010.5557589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal overcurrent relay coordination using genetic algorithms","abstract":"This paper presents an intelligent approach for overcurrent relaying coordination design. Due to a powerful search scheme of the selected intelligent method, genetic algorithms (GA), digital relays are well coordinated to satisfy a large number of constraints, which are complicated over the ability of the conventional relay setting. The proposed scheme was demonstrated through a 6-bus power system, in which fourteen digital overcurrent relays were situated to be coordinated smartly. Also, the results obtained from GA were compared with those obtained by applying an efficient non-linear quasi-Newton method. It strongly confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557589/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11499692","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557589/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","conferenceDate":"19-20 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal overcurrent relay coordination using genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal overcurrent relay coordination using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057181S","chronDate":"19-20 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5547543","isNumber":"5557532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5547543","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5557532","articleId":"5557589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5557611,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Yun","affiliation":["Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Miao Yun","id":"37543992300"},{"name":"Bu Yuxin","affiliation":["Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Bu Yuxin","id":"37545836700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7832-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7831-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7829-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7830-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5557611","dbTime":"42 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Biomedical monitoring","Fires","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Object recognition","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","power engineering computing","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart grid","Internet-of-things infrastructure","IoT infrastructure"]}],"abstract":"Advances in the areas of embedded systems, computing, and networking are leading to an infrastructure composed of millions of heterogeneous devices.

Directional antennas can be exploited in 60 GHz networks to mitigate the detrimental impact of fading. Employing fully directional antennas complicates the neighbor discovery process where each sector must be probed individually to discover neighbors located in that sector. In random scanning strategy, nodes select to-be-scanned sector randomly. In this letter, we analyze the minimum number of random sector scanning attempts during neighbor discovery process to have a non-isolated network. We present an analytical model to study the isolation probability defined as probability of having at least one isolated node in the network. Based on the isolation probability, we derive the minimum number of sector scanning attempts in a 60 GHz ad hoc network with arbitrary number of nodes. Although 60 GHz directional network is studied, this analysis is applicable to any directional wireless network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5572888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.09.100779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5572888/05557637.pdf","startPage":"845","endPage":"847","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.09.100779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sector Scanning Attempts for Non-Isolation in Directional 60 GHz Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","displayDocTitle":"Sector Scanning Attempts for Non-Isolation in Directional 60 GHz Networks","volume":"14","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5557637/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11559466","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557637/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sector Scanning Attempts for Non-Isolation in Directional 60 GHz Networks","sourcePdf":"845-cl1009-olcer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039643S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5572888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5572888","articleId":"5557637","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5557641,"authors":[{"name":"Norifumi Kamiya","affiliation":["Information and Media Processing Laboratories, NEC Corporation Limited, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Norifumi","lastName":"Kamiya","id":"37297121100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5557641","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Parity check codes","Polynomials","IEEE 802.11n Standard","Generators","Bit error rate","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","parity check codes","polynomial matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encodable irregular QC-LDPC codes","self-reciprocal generator polynomials","MDS codes","parity-check matrix","block circulant matrix","maximum distance separable","zero matrices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity-check codes","maximum distance separable codes","encoding"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a class of quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes which are efficiently encodable and have better memory efficiency than other randomly constructed QC-LDPC codes.

To cope with the prohibitive computational complexity involved in estimating multiple CFOs and channels, pilot-assisted and semi-blind schemes comprised of parallel Schmidt Extended Kalman filters (SEKFs) and Schmidt-Kalman Approximate Particle Filters (SK-APF) are proposed. In the SK-APF, a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is developed to first estimate the nonlinear state variable, i.e. the desired user's CFO, through the sampling-importance-resampling (SIRS) technique. The individual user channel responses are then updated via a bank of Kalman filters conditioned on the CFO sample trajectories. Simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes can achieve highly accurate CFO/channel estimates, and that the particle filtering approach in the SK-APF outperforms the more conventional Schmidt Extended Kalman Filter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for Uplink MIMO-OFDMA Systems Using Parallel Schmidt Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.080310.090053","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5577792/05557645.pdf","startPage":"2697","endPage":"2708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.080310.090053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557645/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for Uplink MIMO-OFDMA Systems Using Parallel Schmidt Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5557645/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527850","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimation for Uplink MIMO-OFDMA Systems Using Parallel Schmidt Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters","sourcePdf":"2697-tc1009-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11907S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5577792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5577792","articleId":"5557645","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5557647,"authors":[{"name":"Kamran Kiasaleh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kamran","lastName":"Kiasaleh","id":"37284873000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5557647","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":670},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557647","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive optics","Optical receivers","Error analysis","Optical fiber communication","Modulation","Optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric optics","atmospheric turbulence","automatic repeat request","optical links","pulse position modulation","shot noise","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid ARQ","FSO communication","turbulent atmosphere","hybrid automatic repeat request","binary pulse position modulation","free space optical communication","turbulent optical channel","direct detection mechanism","shot noise","background noise","thermal noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chase","HARQ","FSO","optical","OOK"]}],"abstract":"Hybrid automatic-repeat request (HARQ) technique is investigated for binary pulse-position modulation (BPPM), free-space optical (FSO) communications through turbulent optical channels.

Specifically, we assume that secondary users are allowed to transmit on any subchannel provided that the interference that is created to any primary users is below a critical threshold. We focus on the downlink. We formulate the joint subchannel, power and rate allocation problem in the context of finite queue backlogs with a total power constraint at the base station. Thus, users with small backlogs are only allocated sufficient resources to support their backlogs while users with large backlogs share the remaining resources in a fair and efficient fashion. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a max-min problem that is queue-aware, i.e., on a frame basis. We maximize the smallest rate of any user whose backlog cannot be fully transmitted. While the problem is a large non-linear integer program, we propose an iterative method that can solve it exactly as a sequence of linear integer programs, which provides a benchmark against which to compare fast heuristics. We consider two classes of heuristics. The first is an adaptation of a class of multi-step heuristics that decouples the power and rate allocation problem from the subchannel allocation and is commonly found in the literature. To make this class of heuristics more efficient we propose an additional (final) step. The second is a novel approach, called selective greedy, that does not perform any decoupling. We find that while the multi-step heuristic does well in the non-cognitive setting, this is not always the case in the cognitive setting and the second heuristic shows significant improvement at reduced complexity compared to the multi-step approach. Finally, we also study the influence of system parameters such as number of primary users and critical interference threshold on secondary network performance and provide some valuable insights on the operation of such systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.080610.090901","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05557657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.080610.090901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","startPage":"3100","endPage":"3111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Queue-Aware Resource Allocation for Downlink OFDMA Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Queue-Aware Resource Allocation for Downlink OFDMA Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557657/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574414","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5557657/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Queue-Aware Resource Allocation for Downlink OFDMA Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"3100-tw1010-mitran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179041S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5557657","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5557658,"authors":[{"name":"Weijia Han","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory & State Key Laboratory, Information Science Institute, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Weijia","lastName":"Han","id":"37537329600"},{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory & State Key Laboratory, Information Science Institute, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843400"},{"name":"Zhi Tian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Tian","id":"37278997500"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory & State Key Laboratory, Information Science Institute, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405814700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5557658","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1232},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Cognitive radio","Base stations","Wireless sensor networks","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","sensor fusion","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient cooperative spectrum sensing","minimum overhead","cognitive radio","CSS","superior detection accuracy","minimum cooperation overhead","sensing decision","data fusion center","total cooperation overhead","data fusion rules","DFR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","optimal decision fusion rule"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557658","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.080610.100317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","abstract":"This letter studies cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) in which secondary users efficiently cooperate to achieve superior detection accuracy with minimum cooperation overhead. We consider each cooperative user only spends \"1 bit\" on reporting its own sensing decision to data fusion center as the total cooperation overhead. However, this \"1 bit\" CSS could not gain better sensing outcomes in current data fusion rules (DFRs). To ameliorate this issue, we derive theorems to reveal the optimum threshold of general DFR. Then we propose three novel DFRs and related three algorithms to efficiently obtain the optimum decision threshold for different objectives. By simulations, the proposed DFRs indicate evident improvement on CSS performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.080610.100317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","startPage":"3006","endPage":"3011","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05557658.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Minimum Overhead in Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5557658/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Minimum Overhead in Cognitive Radio","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574420","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Minimum Overhead in Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"3006-tw1010-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073724S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5557658","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5557740,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Hsiang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, San Diego, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ilya Lyubomirsky (M'94) received the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.","His industry experience includes researching voice-over-packet (VOP) networks at Telcordia Technologies, optical metro-networking at ONI Systems, and ultra-dense wavelength division multiplexing (UDWDM) at CIENA Corporation.","Most recently, he was on a one year leave at Infinera Corporation, researching large scale photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology, and applications to high-spectral efficiency optical communication systems.

Both symbol-aligned and symbol-interleaved formats are investigated and compared for nonlinear transmission tolerance on common dispersion maps used in terrestrial long-haul systems. The RZ pulse shape shows the greatest improvement in nonlinear tolerance with symbol-interleaving. However, symbol-interleaving only provides significant benefit in optical line systems designed to preserve the pulse shape during transmission, such as systems based on distributed dispersion compensating fiber (DCF). The duty cycle of the RZ pulse has only a minor impact on nonlinear performance, and even systems based on the NRZ pulse shape can gain significant benefit from symbol-interleaving.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5552243/05557740.pdf","startPage":"2750","endPage":"2756","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2064286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2064286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5552243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of DP-QPSK Pulse Shape in Nonlinear 100 G Transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Nonlinear optics","Dispersion","Optical pulse shaping","Optical transmitters","Shape","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical pulse shaping","quadrature phase shift keying","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DP-QPSK pulse shape","nonlinear 100 G transmission","Monte Carlo simulation analysis","WDM transmission","symbol-aligned format","symbol-interleaved format","terrestrial long-haul systems","distributed dispersion compensating fiber","bit rate 112 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent detection","high spectral efficiency","nonlinear transmission","QPSK"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Impact of DP-QPSK Pulse Shape in Nonlinear 100 G Transmission","volume":"28","issue":"18","htmlLink":"/document/5557740/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11588430","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of DP-QPSK Pulse Shape in Nonlinear 100 G Transmission","sourcePdf":"jlt-lyubomirsky-2064286-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066726S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5552243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5552243","articleId":"5557740","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5557741,"authors":[{"name":"Masakazu Aono","affiliation":["WPI Center of Materials Nanoarchitectonics, National Institute for Materials and Science, Ibaraki, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/5628287/5557741/5557741-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masakazu Aono received the Ph.D. degree in metallurgy from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1972.","After receiving his Ph.D., he became a Research Staff Member of the National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials, where he stayed until 1986.

A new criterion is proposed based on the variance of the spectral flux (VSF), which is shown to be a compound measure of the Kurtosis and across-time correlation for the time-frequency domain signals. Spectral flux (SF) had been adopted as a feature that distinguishes speech from other acoustic noises and the VSF of speech tends to be larger than that of other acoustic sounds. Henceforth, maximization of VSF can be employed as one potential criterion to identify the speech direction-of-arrival (DOA), in order to extract speech from the noisy observations. We construct a VSF-inspired cost function and develop a complex-value fixed-point algorithm for the optimization. Then, the stability of the proposed algorithm is analyzed based on the second-order Taylor series expansion. Rather than the DOA identification ambiguity caused by subspace decomposition-based methods or maximization of non-Gaussianity-based approaches, both real and simulated evaluations indicate that the VSF-inspired criterion can effectively extract speech from a music diffuse noise field or a musical interference noise field. A key feature of the proposed approach is that it can operate blindly, i.e., it does not require a priori knowledge about the array geometry, the noise covariance matrix, or the geometrical knowledge of the location of desired speech. Therefore, this study offers a potential perspective for blindly extracting speech from a music environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557744/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11523357","htmlLink":"/document/5557744/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Beamforming for Blind Extraction of Speech From Music Environment Using Variance of Spectral Flux-Inspired Criterion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Beamforming for Blind Extraction of Speech From Music Environment Using Variance of Spectral Flux-Inspired Criterion","sourcePdf":"jstsp-yu-2069790-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068125S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5571767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5571767","articleId":"5557744","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5557747,"authors":[{"name":"William F.

Unlike existing switched beam arrays operating at 60 GHz, the proposed array scans in both planes. Also, in contrast to 2-D scanning stacks of Butler matrices and Rotman lenses, the proposed SBN is uniplanar and, hence, leads to low-cost manufacturing and integration with 60-GHz radios. The network produces eight 2-D beam states and demonstrates beamforming capability across the entire band of interest (57-64 GHz) with the aid of dummy crossover structures.

presents an ultra-wideband low noise amplifier (LNA) using gallium-nitride (GaN) high-electron mobility transistors (HEMT) technology. A -3 dB bandwidth of 1-25 GHz with 13 dB peak power gain is achieved using a modified resistive-feedback topology. To obtain such a wide bandwidth, several bandwidth enhancement techniques are utilized. An inductor connected to the source of the input transistor ensures good input matching (|S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sub>\n| <; -9 dB) across the entire bandwidth. The shunt feedback loop and the inductive source degeneration minimize all the required inductor values. This GaN HEMT LNA is believed to have the widest bandwidth among all GaN HEMT monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) LNAs reported to date. With 3.3 dB minimum noise figure (F), 33.5 dBm maximum output-referred third-order intercept point (OIP3), 20 dBm maximum output-referred 1 dB compression point (Output P1 dB), this MMIC amplifier is comparable in performance to distributed amplifiers (DAs) but with significantly lower power consumption and smaller area.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2010.2059002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5594751/05557753.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"565","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2010.2059002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1\u201325 GHz GaN HEMT MMIC Low-Noise Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A 1\u201325 GHz GaN HEMT MMIC Low-Noise Amplifier","volume":"20","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5557753/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11561020","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1\u201325 GHz GaN HEMT MMIC Low-Noise Amplifier","sourcePdf":"lmwc-chen-2059002-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090472S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5594751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5594751","articleId":"5557753","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5557757,"authors":[{"name":"Benyuan Zhu","affiliation":["OFS Laboratories, Somerset, USA"],"firstName":"Benyuan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279330200"},{"name":"Thierry F.

At the target design voltage of 200 mV, the level shifter has a propagation delay of 18.4 ns and a static power dissipation of 6.6 nW.

Due to nonlinear hydrodynamics, the bistatic normalized radar cross section (NRCS) calculated from Creamer (2) surfaces is slightly larger than its linear surface counterpart for scattering angles departing from the specular direction, and the Creamer (2) surface backscattering coefficient increases as well for wind direction angles around upwind and downwind, whereas, for the crosswind direction, it is interesting to note that the observations are contrary. However, as was pointed out by Toporkov in a 1-D surface case, the effect of the nonlinear surface model on the average NRCS is minute. In particular, the Doppler spectra of the backscattered echoes are compared for the linear and Creamer (2) surfaces at various incident angles. It is seen, as expected, that the Doppler shifts and spectral widths of 2-D Creamer (2) surfaces exhibit different features compared with those of the linear surfaces, agreeing with the 1-D cases. However, for larger incident angles, the Doppler spectral broadening for Creamer (2) surfaces is not as severe as was reported in previous 1-D studies that used full Creamer model. The reason for this discrepancy appears to be the reduced nature of the Creamer (2) approximation. Moreover, studies of the Doppler characteristics for different wind directions demonstrate that nonlinear effects become weaker as the wind direction varies from upwind to crosswind.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2060204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5695081/05557775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2060204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695081","startPage":"603","endPage":"611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scattering and Doppler Spectral Analysis for Two-Dimensional Linear and Nonlinear Sea Surfaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scattering and Doppler Spectral Analysis for Two-Dimensional Linear and Nonlinear Sea Surfaces","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769612","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5557775/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scattering and Doppler Spectral Analysis for Two-Dimensional Linear and Nonlinear Sea Surfaces","sourcePdf":"tgrs-xu-2060204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096231S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5695081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5695081","articleId":"5557775","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5557781,"authors":[{"name":"Lam T.

Many forms of uncertainty affect the MOP, including uncertainty in the decision variables, parameters or objectives. A source of uncertainty that is not studied in the evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) literature is the decision-maker's attitude to risk (DMAR) even though it has great significance in real-world applications. Often the decision-makers change over the course of the decision-making process and thus, some relevant information about preferences of future decision-makers is unknown at the time a decision is made. This poses a major risk to organizations because a new decision-maker may simply reject a decision that has been made previously. When an EMO technique attempts to generate the set of nondominated solutions for a problem, then DMAR-related uncertainty needs to be reduced. Solutions generated by an EMO technique should be robust against perturbations caused by the DMAR. In this paper, we focus on the DMAR as a source of uncertainty and present two new types of robustness in MOP. In the first type, dominance robustness (DR), the robust Pareto solutions are those which, if perturbed, would have a high chance to move to another Pareto solution. In the second type, preference robustness (PR), the robust Pareto solutions are those that are close to each other in configuration space. Dominance robustness captures the ability of a solution to move along the Pareto optimal front under some perturbative variation in the decision space, while PR captures the ability of a solution to produce a smooth transition (in the decision variable space) to its neighbors (defined in the objective space). We propose methods to quantify these robustness concepts, modify existing EMO techniques to capture robustness against the DMAR, and present test problems to examine both DR and PR.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2010.2051443","startPage":"1","endPage":"19","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6141203/05557781.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2010.2051443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness Against the Decision-Maker's Attitude to Risk in Problems With Conflicting Objectives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Uncertainty","Optimization","Noise","Decision making","Organizations","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","evolutionary computation","Pareto optimisation","risk management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision-maker attitude-to-risk","conflicting objectives","evolutionary multiobjective optimization problems","Pareto set","decision variables","decision-making process","EMO technique","DMAR-related uncertainty","dominance robustness","robust Pareto solutions","preference robustness","configuration space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision making","evolutionary","multi-objective","risk","robustness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Robustness Against the Decision-Maker's Attitude to Risk in Problems With Conflicting Objectives","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5557781/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12494163","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness Against the Decision-Maker's Attitude to Risk in Problems With Conflicting Objectives","sourcePdf":"tevc-lbui-2051443-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128857S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6141203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6141203","articleId":"5557781","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":5557782,"authors":[{"name":"Kalyanmoy Deb","affiliation":["Aalto University School of Economics, Aalto, Finland","Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/5648510/5557782/5557782-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kalyanmoy Deb received the Bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India, in 1985.

Along with the ideal objective vector, it is also needed for the purpose of normalizing different objectives, so as to facilitate a comparison and agglomeration of the objectives. However, the task of estimating the nadir objective vector necessitates information about the complete Pareto-optimal front and has been reported to be a difficult task, and importantly an unsolved and open research issue. In this paper, we propose certain modifications to an existing evolutionary multiobjective optimization procedure to focus its search toward the extreme objective values and combine it with a reference-point based local search approach to constitute a couple of hybrid procedures for a reliable estimation of the nadir objective vector. With up to 20-objective optimization test problems and on a three-objective engineering design optimization problem, one of the proposed procedures is found to be capable of finding the nadir objective vector reliably. The study clearly shows the significance of an evolutionary computing based search procedure in assisting to solve an age-old important task in the field of multiobjective optimization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward an Estimation of Nadir Objective Vector Using a Hybrid of Evolutionary and Local Search Approaches","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2010.2041667","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5648510/05557782.pdf","startPage":"821","endPage":"841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2010.2041667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Toward an Estimation of Nadir Objective Vector Using a Hybrid of Evolutionary and Local Search Approaches","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5557782/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675039","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward an Estimation of Nadir Objective Vector Using a Hybrid of Evolutionary and Local Search Approaches","sourcePdf":"tevc-kdeb-2041667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157328S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5648510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5648510","articleId":"5557782","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5557784,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwen Yu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6087309/5557784/5557784-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiwen Yu (M'09) received the B.S. and M.Phil. degrees from Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong.","He has held a research position with the City University of Hong Kong.

In this paper, a new evolutionary algorithm, referred to as the neighborhood knowledge-based evolutionary algorithm (NKEA), is proposed to solve the multiobjective optimization problem. NKEA not only takes into account the advantages of NSGA-II, and JGGA, such as the fast nondominated sorting algorithm and horizontal transmission of information in a candidate solution, but also exploits systematically the neighborhood knowledge acquired during the search process. Specifically, NKEA consists of three major stages: the direction learning stage, the mutual adaptation stage, and the self adaptation stage. NKEA not only uses the fast nondominated sorting algorithm to find the Pareto optimal solutions, but also adopts the elitist strategy to maintain the best individuals for the next generation based on this strategy. Two adaptive control functions in the mutual adaptation stage and the self adaptation stage are designed to adjust the respective contributions of coarse local search and fine local search, which allows NKEA to perform a more thorough local search. Finally, we introduce a new notion, known as the measure space, which integrates multiple measures, such as the convergence metric and the diversity metric, to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The results of our experiments show that NKEA not only achieves good performance in a large number of multiobjective optimization problems, but also outperforms most of the state-of-the-art approaches in these problems.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2010.2051444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2010.2051444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/6087309/05557784.pdf","startPage":"812","endPage":"831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6087309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557784/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Neighborhood Knowledge-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Multiobjective Optimization Problems","volume":"15","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12388447","htmlLink":"/document/5557784/","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neighborhood Knowledge-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Multiobjective Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-hwong-2051444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149093S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6087309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6087309","articleId":"5557784","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5557786,"authors":[{"name":"Shengxiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunei University, Middlesex, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/5648510/5557786/5557786-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shengxiang Yang (M'00) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in automatic control, and the Ph.D. degree in systems engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1993, 1996, and 1999, respectively.","From 1999 to 2000, he was a Post-Doctoral Research Associate with the Algorithm Design Group, Department of Computer Science, King's College London, London, U.K. From 2000 to 2010, he was a Lecturer with the Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, U.K. He is currently a Senior Lecturer with the Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunel University, U.K. He has over 100 publications.

This requires an optimization algorithm to not only find the global optimal solution under a specific environment but also to track the trajectory of the changing optima over dynamic environments. To address this requirement, this paper investigates a clustering particle swarm optimizer (PSO) for dynamic optimization problems. This algorithm employs a hierarchical clustering method to locate and track multiple peaks. A fast local search method is also introduced to search optimal solutions in a promising subregion found by the clustering method. Experimental study is conducted based on the moving peaks benchmark to test the performance of the clustering PSO in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The experimental results show the efficiency of the clustering PSO for locating and tracking multiple optima in dynamic environments in comparison with other particle swarm optimization models based on the multiswarm method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5648510/05557786.pdf","startPage":"959","endPage":"974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2010.2046667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2010.2046667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5648510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Clustering Particle Swarm Optimizer for Locating and Tracking Multiple Optima in Dynamic Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Clustering methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benchmark testing","dynamic programming","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering","search problems","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimizer","multiple optima tracking","dynamic environment","optimization problem","trajectory tracking","hierarchical clustering method","multiple peak tracking","local search method","benchmark test","multiswarm method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clustering","dynamic optimization problem (DOP)","local search","multiswarm","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Clustering Particle Swarm Optimizer for Locating and Tracking Multiple Optima in Dynamic Environments","volume":"14","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5557786/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675042","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Clustering Particle Swarm Optimizer for Locating and Tracking Multiple Optima in Dynamic Environments","sourcePdf":"tevc-syang-2046667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119936S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5648510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"234","xplore-issue":"5648510","articleId":"5557786","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5557787,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Zamani","affiliation":["Faculty of Informatics, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/5648510/5557787/5557787-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Zamani received the B.S. degree in computer science and operations research, the M.S. degree in systems engineering from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Center for Systems Planning, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 1985, and the Ph.D. degree in operations research from the University of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia, in 1995.","He is currently a Senior Academic Staff Member with the Faculty of Informatics, University of Wollongong.

The control is developed to coordinate power delivered from the two ESS levels in order to minimize diesel fuel consumption and limit up/down rates of the diesel plant. Different control modes are evaluated by simulation, and a subset of the results are validated using a hardware-in-the-loop representation. The controller that combines all three functionalities-minimizing dump load, limiting intrahour diesel ramp rates, and maximizing ESS utilization-demonstrates superior performance as measured by defined metrics and is proven to work online.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5609238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5609238/05557804.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2051392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2051392","startPage":"3896","endPage":"3904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Online Control Algorithm for Application of a Hybrid ESS to a Wind\u2013Diesel System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557804/","displayDocTitle":"An Online Control Algorithm for Application of a Hybrid ESS to a Wind\u2013Diesel System","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557804/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"11721581","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Online Control Algorithm for Application of a Hybrid ESS to a Wind\u2013Diesel System","sourcePdf":"tie-abbey-2051392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149615S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5609238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5609238","articleId":"5557804","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5557805,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Slowik","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, Koszalin University of Technology, Koszalin, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5947747/5557805/5557805-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adam Slowik (M'07), photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Slowik","id":"37266922200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"5557805","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1100},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Neurons","Chromium","Nickel","Classification algorithms","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive differential evolution algorithm","artificial neural network training","multiple trial vectors technique","nondifferentiable neuron activation function","DE-ANNT+ algorithm","parity-p problem","evolutionary algorithm","gradient training methods","error back-propagation","Levenberg-Marquardt method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","artificial neural network","differential evolution algorithm","multiple trial vectors","training method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557805","abstract":"In this paper, an application of an adaptive differential evolution (DE) algorithm with multiple trial vectors for training artificial neural networks (ANNs) is presented. The proposed method is DE-ANNT+, which is a DE-ANN Training (DE-ANNT) modified by adding a multiple trial vectors technique. DE-ANNT+ allows one to train an ANN of arbitrary architectures, and it offers a nondifferentiable neuron activation function. In contrast to a basic DE algorithm, DE-ANNT+ possesses two modifications. In DE-ANNT+, adaptive selection of control parameters and a multiple trial vectors technique are introduced. Adaptive selection means that the number of required parameters of the algorithm is decreased. The multiple trial vectors technique increases the probability of generating a better solution because a greater number of temporary solutions is generated around the existing solutions. The DE-ANNT+ algorithm, with these two modifications, is used for ANN training to classify the parity-p problem. The results from the obtained algorithm have been compared with results from the following algorithms: an evolutionary algorithm, a DE algorithm without multiple trial vectors, gradient training methods, such as error back-propagation, and the Levenberg-Marquardt method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2062474","startPage":"3160","endPage":"3167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2062474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5947747","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5947747/05557805.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of an Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm With Multiple Trial Vectors to Artificial Neural Network Training","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557805/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of an Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm With Multiple Trial Vectors to Artificial Neural Network Training","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5557805/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12157671","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of an Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm With Multiple Trial Vectors to Artificial Neural Network Training","sourcePdf":"tie-slowik-2062474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110755S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5947747","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5947747","articleId":"5557805","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5557810,"authors":[{"name":"Gene Cheung","affiliation":["Kokuritsu Johogaku Kenkyujo, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5713375/5557810/5557810-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gene Cheung (M'00\u2013SM'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 1995, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.","He was a senior researcher with Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Japan, Tokyo, from 2000 to 2009.

Thus, as a client is playing back successive frames (in time) for a given view, it can send a request to the server to switch to a different view while continuing uninterrupted temporal playback. Noting that standard tools for random access (i.e., I-frame insertion) can be bandwidth-inefficient for this application, we propose a redundant representation of I-, P-, and \u201cmerge\u201d frames, where each original picture can be encoded into multiple versions, appropriately trading off expected transmission rate with storage, to facilitate view switching. We first present ad hoc frame structures with good performance when the view-switching probabilities are either very large or very small. We then present optimization algorithms that generate more general frame structures with better overall performance for the general case. We show in our experiments that we can generate redundant frame structures offering a range of tradeoff points between transmission and storage, e.g., outperforming simple I-frame insertion structures by up to 45% in terms of bandwidth efficiency at twice the storage cost.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2070074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5713375/05557810.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2070074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713375","startPage":"744","endPage":"761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive Streaming of Stored Multiview Video Using Redundant Frame Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Streaming of Stored Multiview Video Using Redundant Frame Structures","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557810/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11807478","pubMedId":"20801738","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5557810/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Streaming of Stored Multiview Video Using Redundant Frame Structures","sourcePdf":"tip-cheung-2070074-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097959S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5713375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5713375","articleId":"5557810","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5557818,"authors":[{"name":"Chathuri M.

The gait parameters do not vary distinctly for each gait phase; therefore, it is complex to differentiate gait phases with respect to a threshold value. To overcome this intricacy, the concept of fuzzy logic was applied to detect gait phases with respect to fuzzy membership values. A real-time data-acquisition system was developed consisting of four force-sensitive resistors and two inertial sensors to obtain foot-pressure patterns and knee flexion/extension angle, respectively. The detected gait phases could be further analyzed to identify abnormality occurrences, and hence, is applicable to determine accurate timing for feedback. The large amount of data required for quality gait analysis necessitates the utilization of information technology to store, manage, and extract required information. Therefore, a software application was developed for real-time acquisition of sensor data, data processing, database management, and a user-friendly graphical-user interface as a tool to simplify the task of clinicians. The experiments carried out to validate the proposed system are presented along with the results analysis for normal and pathological walking patterns.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2010.2058813","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5562449/05557818.pdf","startPage":"1173","endPage":"1179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2010.2058813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5562449","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Intelligent Gait-Phase Detection System to Identify Pathological Gait","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Computational Intelligent Gait-Phase Detection System to Identify Pathological Gait","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11519973","pubMedId":"20801745","htmlLink":"/document/5557818/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Intelligent Gait-Phase Detection System to Identify Pathological Gait","sourcePdf":"titb-senanayake-2058813-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106851S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5562449","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5562449","articleId":"5557818","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5557819,"authors":[{"name":"Hendrik Vansompel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Energy, Systems & Automation, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Hendrik","lastName":"Vansompel","id":"37546555600"},{"name":"Peter Sergeant","affiliation":["Department of Electrotechnology, Faculty of Applied Engineering Sciences, University College Ghent, Ghent, Belgium","Dept.

Because the efficiency of the machine is important, specific measures are taken in order to reduce losses in the machine: thin laminated grain oriented material in the teeth, concentrated pole windings, and segmented magnets. A study of the influence of a limited set of geometry parameters on the efficiency of this type of machine is done, using both analytical and finite-element methods. In the analytical as well as in the finite-element model, the inherent 3-D geometry of the axial flux machine is approximated by multiple 2-D models at different radii in circumferential direction.

In the development, the major difficulties included sensing human behaviors, conversation in a noisy daily environment, and the needs of unexpected miscellaneous knowledge in the conversation. We chose a network-robot system approach, where a single robot's poor sensing capability and knowledge are supplemented by ubiquitous sensors and a human operator. The developed robot system detects a person with floor sensors to initiate interaction, identifies individuals with radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, gives shopping information while chatting, and provides route guidance with deictic gestures. The robot was partially teleoperated to avoid the difficulty of speech recognition as well as to furnish a new kind of knowledge that only humans can flexibly provide. The information supplied by a human operator was later used to increase the robot's autonomy. For 25 days in a shopping mall, we conducted a field trial and gathered 2642 interactions. A total of 235 participants signed up to use RFID tags and, later, provided questionnaire responses. The questionnaire results are promising in terms of the visitors' perceived acceptability as well as the encouragement of their shopping activities. The results of the teleoperation analysis revealed that the amount of teleoperation gradually decreased, which is also promising.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557825/","volume":"26","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5557825/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11559820","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Communication Robot in a Shopping Mall","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Communication Robot in a Shopping Mall","sourcePdf":"tro-kanda-2062550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119584S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5592139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"5592139","articleId":"5557825","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5557828,"authors":[{"name":"Wilfried Lepuschitz","affiliation":["Automation and Control Institute, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5669216/5557828/5557828-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wilfried Lepuschitz (M'10) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering with the focus on computer technology, in 2008, from the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in agent-based automation with distributed control systems based on the IEC 61499.","Since 2008, he has been at the Automation and Control Institute, Vienna University of Technology."]},"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Lepuschitz","id":"37397507400"},{"name":"Alois Zoitl","affiliation":["Automation and Control Institute, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5669216/5557828/5557828-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Alois Zoitl (M'09) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering with the focus on automation and control technology from the Vienna University of Technology, Austria, in 2007.","Since 2002, he has been with the Automation and Control Institute, Vienna University of Technology, where he is currently the Head of the Agile Control Group.

Agent technology is considered as a promising approach to provide reconfiguration abilities, but existing work has been focused mainly on the reconfiguration of higher layers concerned with production scheduling and planning. In this paper, we present an automation agent architecture for controlling physical components that integrates \u201con the fly\u201d reconfiguration abilities on the low-level layer. Our approach is combined with an ontological representation of the low-level functionality at the high-level control layer, which is able to reason and initiate reconfiguration processes to modify the low-level control (LLC). As current control systems are mostly based on standards and principles that do not support reconfiguration, leading to rigid control software architectures, we base our approach on the promising Standard IEC 61499 for the LLC, extended by an innovative reconfiguration infrastructure. We demonstrate this approach with a case study of a reconfiguration process that modifies the LLC functionality provided by the automation agent of a physical component. Thereby, we obtain the ability to support numerous different LLC configurations without increasing the LLC's complexity. By applying our automation agent architecture, we enhance not only the flexibility of each component's control software, but also achieve the precondition for reconfiguring the entire manufacturing system.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2059012","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2059012","startPage":"52","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5669216/05557828.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Self-Reconfiguration of Manufacturing Systems Using Automation Agents","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Toward Self-Reconfiguration of Manufacturing Systems Using Automation Agents","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11698352","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5557828/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Self-Reconfiguration of Manufacturing Systems Using Automation Agents","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-lepuschitz-2059012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112699S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5669216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5669216","articleId":"5557828","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5557829,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Baldi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Biomedica, Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Baldi","id":"37063962300"},{"name":"Franco Chiaraluce","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Biomedica, Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Chiaraluce","id":"37273242300"},{"name":"Noureddine Boujnah","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Noureddine","lastName":"Boujnah","id":"37089137445"},{"name":"Roberto Garello","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Garello","id":"37273243900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5557829","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":733},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Polynomials","Binary sequences","Feedback","Random sequences","Artificial neural networks","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary sequences","correlation methods","higher order statistics","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["truncated maximum-length binary sequence","power spectral density","first-order statistics","second-order statistics","periodic autocorrelation function","mean square method","space links","LFSR randomizer","power flux density constraint","LINEAR feedback shift register"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear feedback shift registers","maximum-length sequences","periodic autocorrelation function","truncation noise"]}],"abstract":"Truncated maximum-length binary sequences are studied in this paper.

Explicit bounds are found for the mean square of the periodic autocorrelation function. An analytical technique for evaluating the maximum spectral peak values is derived.

This paper presents a cooperative sequential detection scheme to reduce the average sensing time that is required to reach a detection decision. In the scheme, each cognitive radio computes the log-likelihood ratio for its every measurement, and the base station sequentially accumulates these log-likelihood statistics and determines whether to stop making measurement. The paper studies how to implement the scheme in a robust manner when the assumed signal models have unknown parameters, such as signal strength and noise variance. These ideas are illustrated through two examples in spectrum sensing. One assumes both the signal and noise are Gaussian distributed, while the other assumes the target signal is deterministic.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2070501","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05557833.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2070501","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"6266","endPage":"6283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Sensing via Sequential Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Sensing via Sequential Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557833/","volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5557833/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641756","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Sensing via Sequential Detection","sourcePdf":"tsp-zou-2070501-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111098S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5557833","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5557835,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Y.

The estimation is conducted via training using known pilot symbols transmitted from the terminals, which is a method commonly referred to as pilot symbol-aided modulation. In this context, linear minimum mean square estimation (LMMSE) of composite and individual channels is analyzed. We show that orthogonal pilots, i.e., pilot sequences that are orthogonal over the antenna arrays and the communicating terminals, minimize the composite and individual mean square errors. Using notions of worst-case noise, we obtain lower bounds on the sum rate of information transmission in both directions of the bidirectional relay link and show that the orthogonal pilots perform well against the bound.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying With Imperfect Receiver CSI","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2070087","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5613993/05557835.pdf","startPage":"4377","endPage":"4387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2070087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557835/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying With Imperfect Receiver CSI","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5557835/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630050","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relaying With Imperfect Receiver CSI","sourcePdf":"tvt-panah-2070087-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079858S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5613993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5613993","articleId":"5557835","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5557837,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Amelung","affiliation":["Knowledge-Based Systems and Document Processing research group, Department of Computer Science, Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany","Eudemonia Solutions AG, Magdeburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4620076/5871827/5557837/5557837-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mario Amelung studied business informatics from Otto-von-Guericke University (OvGU), Magdeburg, Germany.

The most relevant aspects of our \u201cassessment as a service\u201d solution are that on the one hand the advantages of automatic assessment can be used with a multitude of programming languages, as well as other formal notations (as so-called backends); on the other hand, the features of these types of assessment can be easily interfaced with different existing learning management systems (as so called frontends).

Most studies tend to overestimation in this respect: Acted data is often used rather than spontaneous data, results are reported on preselected prototypical data, and true speaker disjunctive partitioning is still less common than simple cross-validation. Even speaker disjunctive evaluation can give only a little insight into the generalization ability of today's emotion recognition engines since training and test data used for system development usually tend to be similar as far as recording conditions, noise overlay, language, and types of emotions are concerned. A considerably more realistic impression can be gathered by interset evaluation: We therefore show results employing six standard databases in a cross-corpora evaluation experiment which could also be helpful for learning about chances to add resources for training and overcoming the typical sparseness in the field. To better cope with the observed high variances, different types of normalization are investigated. 1.8 k individual evaluations in total indicate the crucial performance inferiority of inter to intracorpus testing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Corpus Acoustic Emotion Recognition: Variances and Strategies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","doi":"10.1109/T-AFFC.2010.8","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165369/5679839/05557843.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AFFC.2010.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5679839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557843/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Corpus Acoustic Emotion Recognition: Variances and Strategies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5557843/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","publicationDate":"July-Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11729112","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Corpus Acoustic Emotion Recognition: Variances and Strategies","sourcePdf":"tta2010020119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.23817S","chronDate":"July-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"5679839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"5679839","articleId":"5557843","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5557854,"authors":[{"name":"Mahendra Piraveenan","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia","CSIRO Information and Communications Technology Centre, North Ryde, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Mahendra Piraveenan received the BEng degree in computer systems with a 1st class honours from the University of Adelaide, Australia, in 2004.

We also introduce the local (node level) assortativity quantities for in- and out-assortativity. Local assortativity profiles are the distributions of these local quantities over node degrees and can be used to analyze both canonical and real-world directed biological networks. Many biological networks, which have been previously classified as disassortative, are shown to be assortative with respect to these new measures. Finally, we demonstrate the use of local assortativity profiles in analyzing the functionalities of particular nodes and groups of nodes in real-world biological networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557854/","volume":"9","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5557854/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12358061","pubMedId":"20733240","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Assortative mixing in directed biological networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assortative mixing in directed biological networks","sourcePdf":"ttb2012010066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103165S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"6078452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6078452","articleId":"5557854","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5557859,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Chen","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique (LRI), CNRS, University of Paris-Sud XI and INRIA, Orsay, France","NICTA, Eveleigh, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5739684/5557859/5557859-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lin Chen received the BE degree in radio engineering from Southeast University, China, in 2002, the engineer diploma from Telecom ParisTech in 2005, and the MS degree in networking from Paris University.

Most existing studies focus on physical-layer optimization of the effective channel capacity for a given transmitter-receiver link; however, the interaction among simultaneous flows between different endpoint pairs, and the conflicts arising from their competition for a shared pool of relay nodes, are not yet well understood. In this paper, we study a distributed pricing framework, where sources pay relay nodes to forward their packets, and the payment is shared equally whenever a packet is successfully relayed by several nodes at once. We formulate this scenario as a Stackelberg (leader-follower) game, in which sources set the payment rates they offer, and relay nodes respond by choosing the flows to cooperate with. We provide a systematic analysis of the fundamental structural properties of this generic model. We show that multiple follower equilibria exist in general due to the nonconcave nature of their game, yet only one equilibrium possesses certain continuity properties that further lead to a unique system equilibrium among the leaders. We further demonstrate that the resulting equilibria are reasonably efficient in several typical scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.152","startPage":"758","endPage":"772","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5739684/05557859.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5739684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conflicts and Incentives in Wireless Cooperative Relaying: A Distributed Market Pricing Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Conflicts and Incentives in Wireless Cooperative Relaying: A Distributed Market Pricing Framework","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557859/","accessionNumber":"11903401","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557859/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conflicts and Incentives in Wireless Cooperative Relaying: A Distributed Market Pricing Framework","sourcePdf":"ttd2011050758.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134873S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5739684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5739684","articleId":"5557859","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5557863,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37399048400"},{"name":"Zhengyu He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"He","id":"37404105800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"5557863","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":724},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557863","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Complexity theory","Parallel algorithms","Graphics processing unit","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","graph theory","multi-threading","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous multithreaded algorithm","maximum network flow problem","nonblocking global relabeling heuristic","push-relabel algorithm","graph theory","asynchronous global relabeling heuristic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum network flow","parallel algorithm","multithreading","lock-free."]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel asynchronous multithreaded algorithm for the maximum network flow problem. The algorithm is based on the classical push-relabel algorithm, which is essentially sequential and requires intensive and costly lock usages to parallelize it. The novelty of the algorithm is in the removal of lock and barrier usages, thereby enabling a much more efficient multithreaded implementation. The newly designed push and relabel operations are executed completely asynchronously and each individual process/thread independently decides when to terminate itself. We further propose an asynchronous global relabeling heuristic to speed up the algorithm. We prove that our algorithm finds a maximum flow with O(|V|\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n||-E|) operations, where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. We also prove the correctness of the relabeling heuristic. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm exhibits better scalability and faster execution speed than the lock-based parallel push-relabel algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.156","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5756300/05557863.pdf","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5756300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Asynchronous Multithreaded Algorithm for the Maximum Network Flow Problem with Nonblocking Global Relabeling Heuristic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557863/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"An Asynchronous Multithreaded Algorithm for the Maximum Network Flow Problem with Nonblocking Global Relabeling Heuristic","volume":"22","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11971983","htmlLink":"/document/5557863/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Asynchronous Multithreaded Algorithm for the Maximum Network Flow Problem with Nonblocking Global Relabeling Heuristic","sourcePdf":"ttd2011061025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052963S","chronDate":"June  2011","isNumber":"5756300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5557863","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5557865,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbin Fang","affiliation":["Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5720391/5557865/5557865-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenbin Fang received the the BE degree in computer sciences from Nankai University in 2007, and the MPhil degree in computer sciences from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2010.

MapReduce is a simple and flexible parallel programming paradigm originally proposed by Google, for the ease of large-scale data processing on thousands of CPUs. Compared with CPUs, GPUs have an order of magnitude higher computation power and memory bandwidth. However, GPUs are designed as special-purpose coprocessors and their programming interfaces are less familiar than those on the CPUs to MapReduce programmers. To harness GPUs' power for MapReduce, we developed Mars to run on NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs as well as multicore CPUs. Furthermore, we integrated Mars into Hadoop, an open-source CPU-based MapReduce system. Mars hides the programming complexity of GPUs behind the simple and familiar MapReduce interface, and automatically manages task partitioning, data distribution, and parallelization on the processors. We have implemented six representative applications on Mars and evaluated their performance on PCs equipped with GPUs as well as multicore CPUs. The experimental results show that, the GPU-CPU coprocessing of Mars on an NVIDIA GTX280 GPU and an Intel quad-core CPU outperformed Phoenix, the state-of-the-art MapReduce on the multicore CPU with a speedup of up to 72 times and 24 times on average, depending on the applications. Additionally, integrating Mars into Hadoop enabled GPU acceleration for a network of PCs.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5720391/05557865.pdf","startPage":"608","endPage":"620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5720391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mars: Accelerating MapReduce with Graphics Processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Mars: Accelerating MapReduce with Graphics Processors","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5557865/","accessionNumber":"11834627","volume":"22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mars: Accelerating MapReduce with Graphics Processors","sourcePdf":"ttd2011040608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114773S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5720391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5720391","articleId":"5557865","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5557879,"authors":[{"name":"Hae Jong Seo","affiliation":["Electrical engineering, UCSC"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5735600/5557879/5557879-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hae Jong Seo received the BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2006, respectively.

The proposed method uses a single example of an action as a query to find similar matches. It does not require prior knowledge about actions, foreground/background segmentation, or any motion estimation or tracking. Our method is based on the computation of novel space-time descriptors from the query video which measure the likeness of a voxel to its surroundings. Salient features are extracted from said descriptors and compared against analogous features from the target video. This comparison is done using a matrix generalization of the cosine similarity measure. The algorithm yields a scalar resemblance volume, with each voxel indicating the likelihood of similarity between the query video and all cubes in the target video. Using nonparametric significance tests by controlling the false discovery rate, we detect the presence and location of actions similar to the query video. High performance is demonstrated on challenging sets of action data containing fast motions, varied contexts, and complicated background. Further experiments on the Weizmann and KTH data sets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in action categorization.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.156","startPage":"867","endPage":"882","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5735600/05557879.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Action Recognition from One Example","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Action Recognition from One Example","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","volume":"33","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557879/","accessionNumber":"11874882","pubMedId":"20733220","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557879/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Action Recognition from One Example","sourcePdf":"ttp2011050867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142888S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5735600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5735600","articleId":"5557879","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5557884,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Arbel\u00e1ez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5735600/5557884/5557884-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pablo Arbel\u00e1ez received the PhD degree with honors in applied mathematics from the Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine in 2005.

In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations.

This allows us to derive a fast, robust, and scalable SfM algorithm for large scale applications. The SfM algorithm developed in this paper is experimentally demonstrated to have favorable properties compared to the sparse bundle adjustment algorithm. We provide experimental evidence indicating that the proposed algorithm converges in many cases to solutions with lower error than state-of-art implementations of bundle adjustment. We also demonstrate that for the case of large reconstruction problems, the proposed algorithm takes lesser time to reach its solution compared to bundle adjustment.

K-means clustering is then used to identify candidate text regions based on the maximum difference. The skeleton of each connected component helps to separate the different text strings from each other. Finally, text string straightness and edge density are used for false positive elimination. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to handle graphics text and scene text of both horizontal and nonhorizontal orientation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5672630/05557889.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5672630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Laplacian Approach to Multi-Oriented Text Detection in Video","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laplace equations","Skeleton","Filtering","Decision support systems","Frequency domain analysis","Color","Graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["character recognition","Fourier transforms","frequency-domain analysis","image thinning","Laplace transforms","object detection","pattern clustering","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Laplacian approach","multioriented text detection","frequency domain","video text detection","Fourier-Laplacian filtering","K-means clustering","text region identification","component skeleton","text string straightness","edge density","false positive elimination","graphics text","scene text"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Connected component analysis","frequency domain processing","text detection","text orientation."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Laplacian Approach to Multi-Oriented Text Detection in Video","volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5557889/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11698394","pubMedId":"20733217","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Laplacian Approach to Multi-Oriented Text Detection in Video","sourcePdf":"ttp2011020412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069443S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5672630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"202","xplore-issue":"5672630","articleId":"5557889","onlineDate":"26 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5557959,"authors":[{"name":"Afkham Azeez","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Afkham","lastName":"Azeez","id":"37546187700"},{"name":"Srinath Perera","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Srinath","lastName":"Perera","id":"37528286400"},{"name":"Dimuthu Gamage","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dimuthu","lastName":"Gamage","id":"37545436600"},{"name":"Ruwan Linton","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ruwan","lastName":"Linton","id":"37544993700"},{"name":"Prabath Siriwardana","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Prabath","lastName":"Siriwardana","id":"37546188700"},{"name":"Dimuthu Leelaratne","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dimuthu","lastName":"Leelaratne","id":"37546189100"},{"name":"Sanjiva Weerawarana","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjiva","lastName":"Weerawarana","id":"37333061000"},{"name":"Paul Fremantle","affiliation":["WSO2, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Fremantle","id":"37546184900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557959","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":2182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Carbon","Servers","Service oriented architecture","Security","Business","Databases","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","middleware","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-tenant SOA middleware","cloud computing","enterprise IT infrastructure","service oriented architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-tenancy","SaaS","PaaS","Cloud Computing","SOA"]}],"abstract":"Enterprise IT infrastructure incurs many costs ranging from hardware costs and software licenses/maintenance costs to the costs of monitoring, managing, and maintaining IT infrastructure. The recent advent of cloud computing offers some tangible prospects of reducing some of those costs; however, abstractions provided by cloud computing are often inadequate to provide major cost savings across the IT infrastructure life-cycle. Multi-tenancy, which allows a single application to emulate multiple application instances, has been proposed as a solution to this problem. By sharing one application across many tenants, multi-tenancy attempts to replace many small application instances with one or few large instances thus bringing down the overall cost of IT infrastructure. In this paper, we present an architecture for achieving multi-tenancy at the SOA level, which enables users to run their services and other SOA artifacts in a multi-tenant SOA framework as well as provides an environment to build multi-tenant applications. We discuss architecture, design decisions, and problems encountered, together with potential solutions when applicable. Primary contributions of this paper are motivating multi-tenancy, and the design and implementation of a multi-tenant SOA platform which allows users to run their current applications in a multi-tenant environment with minimal or no modifications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-tenant SOA Middleware for Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.50","startPage":"458","endPage":"465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557959.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-tenant SOA Middleware for Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557959/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499453","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-tenant SOA Middleware for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048296S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5557960,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Jung La","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun Jung","lastName":"La","id":"37542872800"},{"name":"Soo Dong Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soo Dong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37834392600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557960","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Clouds","Context-aware services","Monitoring","Computer architecture","Adaptation model","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information technology","mobile computing","user interfaces","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information technology","cloud computing","mobile computing","mobile internet device","cloud services","location-specific map service","context-aware mobile services","iPhones","Android"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Service","Mobile Internet Device","Context-awareness","Adaptation"]}],"abstract":"We observe two of the recent trends in information technology. Cloud Computing (CC) is widely accepted as an effective reuse paradigm. Mobile Computing with Mobile Internet Device (MID) such as iPhones and Android devices becomes a convenient alternative to personal computers by integrating mobility, communication, software functionality, and entertainment. Due to the resource limitations of MIDs, cloud services become an ideal alternative to software installed on MIDs. A key feature of MIDs is the capability of sensing users' contexts such as location, acceleration, longitude, latitude and movement. Hence, it is tempting to configure and provide cloud services for the specific context sensed, such as location-specific Map service. In this paper, we present a framework for enabling context-aware mobile services. The framework enables tasks of capturing context, determining what context-specific adaptation is needed, tailoring candidate services for the context, and running the adapted service. The net result of context-aware services is for consumers to receive better services which fit to the current context of the consumers.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.78","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557960.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","startPage":"466","endPage":"473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Conceptual Framework for Provisioning Context-aware Mobile Cloud Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Conceptual Framework for Provisioning Context-aware Mobile Cloud Services","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557960/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499427","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5557960/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Conceptual Framework for Provisioning Context-aware Mobile Cloud Services","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051107S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5557966,"authors":[{"name":"Fangzhe Chang","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, UK"],"firstName":"Fangzhe","lastName":"Chang","id":"37530883100"},{"name":"Jennifer Ren","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, UK"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Ren","id":"37532995200"},{"name":"Ramesh Viswanathan","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, UK"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Viswanathan","id":"37375329500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557966","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1660},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Approximation algorithms","Approximation methods","Clouds","Algorithm design and analysis","Databases","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","Internet","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal resource allocation","virtual machines","NP-complete problem","approximation algorithm","polynomial time","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Cloud platforms enable enterprises to lease computing power in the form of virtual machines. An important problem for such enterprise users is to understand how many and what kinds of virtual machines will be needed from clouds. We formulate demand for computing power and other resources as a resource allocation problem with multiplicity, where computations that have to be performed concurrently are represented as tasks and a later task can reuse resources released by an earlier task. We show that finding a minimized allocation is NP-complete. This paper presents an approximation algorithm with a proof of its approximation bound that can yield close to optimum solutions in polynomial time. Enterprise users can exploit the solution to reduce the leasing cost and amortize the administration overhead (e.g., setting up VPNs or configuring a cluster). Cloud providers may utilize the solution to share their resources among a larger number of users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation in Clouds","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.38","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557966.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation in Clouds","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557966/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499433","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Resource Allocation in Clouds","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118155S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5557967,"authors":[{"name":"Li Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Guo","id":"37532589000"},{"name":"Yike Guo","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Yike","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882400"},{"name":"Xiangchuan Tian","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Xiangchuan","lastName":"Tian","id":"37537342800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557967","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Cloud computing","Integrated circuits","Virtual machining","Monitoring","Computer architecture","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","Internet","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IC Cloud","composable cloud computing","imperial college cloud","generic design space","cloud computing architectures","SOA principle","highly flexible system design approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","IaaS System","Composable Cloud"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing has attracted great interest from both academic and industrial communities.

Currently, the major clouds are planning the transition to the stage 2, but how to achieve the stage 3 is unclear because some architectural limitations have to be overcome.

In order to address such concerns we propose a solution based on the Cross-Cloud Federation Manager, a new component placeable inside the cloud architectures, allowing a cloud to establish the federation with other clouds according to a three-phase model: discovery, match-making and authentication.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.46","startPage":"337","endPage":"345","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557976.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to Enhance Cloud Architectures to Enable Cross-Federation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Authentication","Computer architecture","Virtual machining","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud architectures","cloud services","monolithic","vertical supply chain","horizontal federation","cross-cloud federation manager"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Cross(-Cloud) Federation","Cloud Architecture","Cloud Infrastructure","Heterogeneous Systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"How to Enhance Cloud Architectures to Enable Cross-Federation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557976/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499442","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to Enhance Cloud Architectures to Enable Cross-Federation","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06369S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"185","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":5557981,"authors":[{"name":"Prasad Saripalli","affiliation":["Runaware, Inc., Coral Springs, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Prasad","lastName":"Saripalli","id":"37546610700"},{"name":"Ben Walters","affiliation":["Runaware, Inc., Coral Springs, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Walters","id":"37546610600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557981","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3522},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Clouds","Availability","Risk management","Organizations","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","risk management","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QUIRC","quantitative impact","risk assessment framework","cloud security","cloud computing platforms","security objectives","wide-band Delphi method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Security","STRIDE","Risk","Impact","Delphi Method","Risk Asessment","CIAMAU"]}],"abstract":"A quantitative risk and impact assessment framework (QUIRC) is presented, to assess the security risks associated with cloud computing platforms. This framework, called QUIRC, defines risk as a combination of the Probability of a security threat event and it's Severity, measured as its Impact. Six key Security Objectives (SO) are identified for cloud platforms, and it is proposed that most of the typical attack vectors and events map to one of these six categories. Wide-band Delphi method is proposed as a scientific means to collect the information necessary for assessing security risks. Risk assessment knowledgebases could be developed specific to each industry vertical, which then serve as inputs for security risk assessment of cloud computing platforms. QUIRC's key advantage is its fully quantitative and iterative convergence approach, which enables stakeholders to comparatively assess the relative robustness of different cloud vendor offerings and approaches in a defensible manner.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QUIRC: A Quantitative Impact and Risk Assessment Framework for Cloud Security","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.22","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557981.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"QUIRC: A Quantitative Impact and Risk Assessment Framework for Cloud Security","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557981/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499447","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QUIRC: A Quantitative Impact and Risk Assessment Framework for Cloud Security","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054392S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5557983,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA","School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533625500"},{"name":"Ling Liu","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280776600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557983","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":173,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4494},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Clouds","Privacy","Authorization","Communities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","Internet","medical administrative data processing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic health record","EHR sharing environment","cloud computing","health IT infrastructure","EHR integration","EHR security reference model","security issues","privacy issues","use-case scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EHR","cloud computing","healthcare","security","privacy"]}],"abstract":"With the widespread use of electronic health record (EHR), building a secure EHR sharing environment has attracted a lot of attention in both healthcare industry and academic community.

In Grid computing, we find that in certain conditions, Push model has high consistency but low efficiency, while Pull model has low consistency but high efficiency. Based on complementary properties of the two models, we propose a user-oriented resource monitoring model named Push&Pull (P&P) for Cloud computing, which employs both the above two models, and switches the two models intelligently according to users' requirements and monitored resources' status. The experimental result shows that the P&P model decreases updating costs and satisfies various users' requirements of consistency between monitoring components and monitored resources compared to the original models.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.85","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557986.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","startPage":"260","endPage":"267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"P&P: A Combined Push-Pull Model for Resource Monitoring in Cloud Computing Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"P&P: A Combined Push-Pull Model for Resource Monitoring in Cloud Computing Environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557986/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499457","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5557986/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"P&P: A Combined Push-Pull Model for Resource Monitoring in Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058865S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":5557987,"authors":[{"name":"Sangho Yi","affiliation":["INRIA Rhone-Alpes, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Sangho","lastName":"Yi","id":"37531687600"},{"name":"Derrick Kondo","affiliation":["INRIA Rhone-Alpes, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Derrick","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37283781100"},{"name":"Artur Andrzejak","affiliation":["Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Artur","lastName":"Andrzejak","id":"37330631400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557987","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":141,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1363},"abstract":"Recently introduced spot instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) offer lower resource costs in exchange for reduced reliability; these instances can be revoked abruptly due to price and demand fluctuations.

We study how one such a mechanism, namely check pointing, can be used to minimize the cost and volatility of resource provisioning. Based on the real price history of EC2 spot instances, we compare several adaptive check pointing schemes in terms of monetary costs and improvement of job completion times. Trace-based simulations show that our approach can reduce significantly both price and the task completion times.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557987.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Costs of Spot Instances via Checkpointing in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Checkpointing","Probability density function","History","Adaptive systems","Pricing","Reliability","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["checkpointing","Internet","middleware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spot instances","checkpointing mechanism","Amazon elastic compute cloud","cost-reliability trade-offs","resource provisioning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Checkpointing","Reliability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Costs of Spot Instances via Checkpointing in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557987/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499458","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Costs of Spot Instances via Checkpointing in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103476S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"141","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5557988,"authors":[{"name":"Ivona Brandic","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Ivona","lastName":"Brandic","id":"37296890800"},{"name":"Schahram Dustdar","affiliation":["Distributed Systems Group, University of Technology, Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Schahram","lastName":"Dustdar","id":"37267275000"},{"name":"Tobias Anstett","affiliation":["Institute of Architecture of Application Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Anstett","id":"37546195000"},{"name":"David Schumm","affiliation":["Institute of Architecture of Application Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Schumm","id":"37546195500"},{"name":"Frank Leymann","affiliation":["Institute of Architecture of Application Systems, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Leymann","id":"37320996200"},{"name":"Ralf Konrad","affiliation":["T-Systems International GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Konrad","id":"37532150600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557988","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":986},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Unified modeling language","DSL","Security","Portals","Business","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","Internet","middleware","programming languages","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compliant cloud computing","user-driven compliance management","cloud providers","nonfunctional performance metrics","service security","service trust","service privacy","domain specific languages","compliance level agreements","C3 middleware","user requirements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compliance managmenet","SLAs","DSLs"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing represents a promising computing paradigm, where computational power is provided similar to utilities like water, electricity or gas. While most of the Cloud providers can guarantee some measurable non-functional performance metrics e.g., service availability or throughput, there is lack of adequate mechanisms for guaranteeing certifiable and auditable security, trust, and privacy of the applications and the data they process. This lack represents an obstacle for moving most business relevant applications into the Cloud. In this paper we devise a novel approach for compliance management in Clouds, which we termed Compliant Cloud Computing (C3). On one hand, we propose novel languages for specifying compliance requirements concerning security, privacy, and trust by leveraging domain specific languages and compliance level agreements. On the other hand, we propose the C3 middleware responsible for the deployment of certifiable and auditable applications, for provider selection in compliance with the user requirements, and for enactment and enforcement of compliance level agreements. We underpin our approach with a use case discussing various techniques necessary for achieving security, privacy, and trust in Clouds as for example data fragmentation among different protection domains or among different geographical regions.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.42","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557988.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","startPage":"244","endPage":"251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compliant Cloud Computing (C3): Architecture and Language Support for User-Driven Compliance Management in Clouds","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compliant Cloud Computing (C3): Architecture and Language Support for User-Driven Compliance Management in Clouds","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557988/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499459","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5557988/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compliant Cloud Computing (C3): Architecture and Language Support for User-Driven Compliance Management in Clouds","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073123S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5557990,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Van den Bossche","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Universiteit Antwerpen, Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Van den Bossche","id":"37320904700"},{"name":"Kurt Vanmechelen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Universiteit Antwerpen, Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Vanmechelen","id":"37320385700"},{"name":"Jan Broeckhove","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Universiteit Antwerpen, Antwerp, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Broeckhove","id":"37271711100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557990","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":154,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3008},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Runtime","Schedules","Computational modeling","Scheduling","Memory management","Pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","linear programming","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-optimal scheduling","hybrid IaaS clouds","deadline constrained workloads","public cloud offerings","surge computing-outsourcing tasks","multiprovider hybrid cloud setting","migratable workloads","linear programming","binary integer program","infrastructure-as-a-service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Scheduling","Linear programming"]}],"abstract":"With the recent emergence of public cloud offerings, surge computing -outsourcing tasks from an internal data center to a cloud provider in times of heavy load- has become more accessible to a wide range of consumers. Deciding which workloads to outsource to what cloud provider in such a setting, however, is far from trivial. The objective of this decision is to maximize the utilization of the internal data center and to minimize the cost of running the outsourced tasks in the cloud, while fulfilling the applications' quality of service constraints. We examine this optimization problem in a multi-provider hybrid cloud setting with deadline-constrained and preemptible but non-provider-migratable workloads that are characterized by memory, CPU and data transmission requirements. Linear programming is a general technique to tackle such an optimization problem. At present, it is however unclear whether this technique is suitable for the problem at hand and what the performance implications of its use are. We therefore analyze and propose a binary integer program formulation of the scheduling problem and evaluate the computational costs of this technique with respect to the problem's key parameters. We found out that this approach results in a tractable solution for scheduling applications in the public cloud, but that the same method becomes much less feasible in a hybrid cloud setting due to very high solve time variances.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.58","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557990.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Optimal Scheduling in Hybrid IaaS Clouds for Deadline Constrained Workloads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557990/","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Optimal Scheduling in Hybrid IaaS Clouds for Deadline Constrained Workloads","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499461","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557990/","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Optimal Scheduling in Hybrid IaaS Clouds for Deadline Constrained Workloads","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053455S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5557999,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Woong Park","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Woong","lastName":"Park","id":"37539844500"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Park","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Kyu","lastName":"Park","id":"37406942300"},{"name":"Jaesun Han","affiliation":["Nex Company Limited, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaesun","lastName":"Han","id":"37535079700"},{"name":"Kyu Ho Park","affiliation":["Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyu Ho","lastName":"Park","id":"37281165700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5557999","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":784},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Protocols","Cloud computing","Digital signatures","Computer architecture","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signatures","Internet","invoicing","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["THEMIS billing system","cloud computing environment","mutually verifiable billing system","mutually verifiable resource usage mechanism","digital signature","cloud notary authority","public key infrastructure","iCube Cloud"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Billing","Non-Repudiation","PKI"]}],"abstract":"The ability to record and keep account of the usage of cloud resources in a credible and verifiable way is a precursor to widespread cloud deployment and availability because usage information is potentially sensitive and must be verifiably accurate. In an attempt to provide a mutually verifiable resource usage and billing mechanism, we found that the frequent asymmetric key operations of a digital signature lead to excessive computations and a bottleneck of billing transactions. As a remedy for these limitations, we propose a mutually verifiable billing system called THEMIS. The system, which introduces the concept of a cloud notary authority for the supervision of billing, makes billing more objective and acceptable to users and cloud service providers. THEMIS generates mutually verifiable binding information that can be used to resolve future disputes between a user and a cloud service provider. Because THEMIS does not require any asymmetric key operations of users and providers, it provides a level of security that is identical to that of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and it minimizes the latency of billing transactions. This work has been undertaken on a real cloud computing service called iCube Cloud.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.21","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05557999.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"THEMIS: Towards Mutually Verifiable Billing Transactions in the Cloud Computing Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5557999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5557999/","displayDocTitle":"THEMIS: Towards Mutually Verifiable Billing Transactions in the Cloud Computing Environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499470","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5557999/","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"THEMIS: Towards Mutually Verifiable Billing Transactions in the Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073661S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5557999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5558001,"authors":[{"name":"Inigo Goiri","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Inigo","lastName":"Goiri","id":"37393924500"},{"name":"Jordi Guitart","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Guitart","id":"37300097500"},{"name":"Jordi Torres","affiliation":["Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Torres","id":"37270777700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5558001","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":999},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558001","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Clouds","Outsourcing","Resource management","Power demand","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","socio-economic effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud federation","providers profit enhancement","federation decision","customer requirements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud provider","outsourcing","federation","economic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.32","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05558001.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing Cloud Federation for Enhancing Providers' Profit","abstract":"Cloud federation has been proposed as a new paradigm that allows providers to avoid the limitation of owning only a restricted amount of resources, which forces them to reject new customers when they have not enough local resources to fulfill their customers' requirements. Federation allows a provider to dynamically outsource resources to other providers in response to demand variations. It also allows a provider that has underused resources to rent part of them to other providers. Both things could make the provider to get more profit when used adequately. This requires that the provider has a clear understanding of the potential of each federation decision, in order to choose the most convenient depending on the environment conditions. In this paper, we present a complete characterization of providers' federation in the Cloud, including decision equations to outsource resources to other providers, rent free resources to other providers (i.e. insourcing), or shutdown unused nodes to save power, and we characterize these decisions as a function of several parameters. Then, we demonstrate in the evaluation section how a provider can enhance its profit by using these equations to exploit federation, and how the different parameters influence which is the best decision on each situation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558001/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11499472","publicationDate":"July 2010","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5558001/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing Cloud Federation for Enhancing Providers' Profit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing Cloud Federation for Enhancing Providers' Profit","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076761S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5558001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5558004,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep Teregowda","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Pradeep","lastName":"Teregowda","id":"37282178000"},{"name":"Bhuvan Urgaonkar","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Bhuvan","lastName":"Urgaonkar","id":"37404034800"},{"name":"C.

The LLFT middleware maintains strong replica consistency, offers application transparency, and achieves low end-to-end latency.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05558010.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Tolerance Middleware for Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.26","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fault Tolerance Middleware for Cloud Computing","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499481","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5558010/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Tolerance Middleware for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102269S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5558010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5558012,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Pu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA","School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Pu","id":"37409284000"},{"name":"Ling Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280776600"},{"name":"Yiduo Mei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China","School of Computer Science, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Yiduo","lastName":"Mei","id":"37533089500"},{"name":"Sankaran Sivathanu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Sankaran","lastName":"Sivathanu","id":"38565591600"},{"name":"Younggyun Koh","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Younggyun","lastName":"Koh","id":"37274152500"},{"name":"Calton Pu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Calton","lastName":"Pu","id":"37279927300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5558012","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":92,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2068},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Driver circuits","Interference","Measurement","Hardware","Virtual machine monitors","Clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","resource allocation","scheduling","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance interference","I/O workload","virtualized cloud environments","server virtualization","parallel virtual machines","CPU scheduling","resource management","resource multiplexing","resource scheduling","Xen virtual machine monitors","cloud service providers","cloud consumers","network-intensive workloads","CPU-intensive workloads"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Xen","I/O","Interference"]}],"abstract":"Server virtualization offers the ability to slice large, underutilized physical servers into smaller, parallel virtual machines (VMs), enabling diverse applications to run in isolated environments on a shared hardware platform. Effective management of virtualized cloud environments introduces new and unique challenges, such as efficient CPU scheduling for virtual machines, effective allocation of virtual machines to handle both CPU intensive and I/O intensive workloads. Although a fair number of research projects have dedicated to measuring, scheduling, and resource management of virtual machines, there still lacks of in-depth understanding of the performance factors that can impact the efficiency and effectiveness of resource multiplexing and resource scheduling among virtual machines. In this paper, we present our experimental study on the performance interference in parallel processing of CPU and network intensive workloads in the Xen Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs). We conduct extensive experiments to measure the performance interference among VMs running network I/O workloads that are either CPU bound or network bound. Based on our experiments and observations, we conclude with four key findings that are critical to effective management of virtualized cloud environments for both cloud service providers and cloud consumers. First, running network-intensive workloads in isolated environments on a shared hardware platform can lead to high overheads due to extensive context switches and events in driver domain and VMM. Second, co-locating CPU-intensive workloads in isolated environments on a shared hardware platform can incur high CPU contention due to the demand for fast memory pages exchanges in I/O channel. Third, running CPU-intensive workloads and network-intensive workloads in conjunction incurs the least resource contention, delivering higher aggregate performance. Last but not the least, identifying factors that impact the total demand of the exchanged memory pages is critical to the in-depth understanding of the interference overheads in I/O channel in the driver domain and VMM.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.65","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05558012.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Performance Interference of I/O Workload in Virtualized Cloud Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558012/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Performance Interference of I/O Workload in Virtualized Cloud Environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499483","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5558012/","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Performance Interference of I/O Workload in Virtualized Cloud Environments","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092348S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5558012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5558018,"authors":[{"name":"Janaka Balasooriya","affiliation":["School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Janaka","lastName":"Balasooriya","id":"37427179000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5558018","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":361},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Biology","Computer architecture","Cloud computing","Software","Ecosystems","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","grid computing","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing infrastructure","biological echo-systems","gene analysis","protein analysis","bioinformatics","scientific discovery","data distribution","grid based scientific workflow tools","Web based scientific workflow tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Biologocal Cloud Systems"]}],"abstract":"The Biological applications such as Gene and Protein analysis integrate and analyze biological data for the research in many bioinformatics and other bio related fields.

Grid based and/or web based scientific workflow tools are used for bioinformatics related complex research to make scientists' and researchers' work easier. On average, scientists spend about 80% of their time assembling data to prepare for analysis. This is due largely in part to the fact that many of these resources required for data processing must be gathered from an external source. The best of these resources, however, are scattered across the globe. They are hosted at universities, institutes, and laboratories throughout the world. To bring all of these resources together by hiding system, network, and application level heterogeneity issues are challenging.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing Infrastructure for Biological Echo-Systems","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.80","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05558018.pdf","startPage":"526","endPage":"527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing Infrastructure for Biological Echo-Systems","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5558018/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499489","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing Infrastructure for Biological Echo-Systems","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029989S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5558018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5558024,"authors":[{"name":"Meiko Jensen","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rt: Institute for IT Security, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Meiko","lastName":"Jensen","id":"37310179000"},{"name":"Sven Sch\u00e4ge","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rt: Institute for IT Security, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Sch\u00e4ge","id":"37545906800"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Schwenk","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rt: Institute for IT Security, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Schwenk","id":"37317810500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5558024","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":939},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Cloud computing","Companies","Semantics","Security","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","data privacy","digital signatures","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anonymous access control","accountability scheme","cloud computing","trust aspect","data anonymization","ring signatures","group signatures","cloud provider"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anonymity","cloud","ring signature scheme","group signature scheme","access control"]}],"abstract":"An important aspect of trust in cloud computing consists in preventing the cloud provider from misusing the user's data.

Today's event sampling methodologies are triggered by the current value of the sensor. State-estimators are designed to cope with such methods. In this paper we propose a sampling method in which an event is triggered depending on the reduction of the estimator's uncertainty and estimation-error. As such, communication requirements are minimized while attaining a certain error- covariance matrix and estimation error at the state-estimator. Furthermore, it is proven that the error-covariance matrix is asymptotically bounded in case the designed sampling protocol is combined with an event-based state-estimator. An illustrative example shows that the developed protocol provides an improved state estimation, while minimizing communication between sensor and state-estimator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 July 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-25 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5558098/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499404","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Relevant Sampling Applied to Event-Based State-Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relevant Sampling Applied to Event-Based State-Estimation","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"4096a618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064065S","chronDate":"18-25 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557895","isNumber":"5558025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557895","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5558025","articleId":"5558098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5558142,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Farhan Husain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad Farhan","lastName":"Husain","id":"37543300400"},{"name":"Latifur Khan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX"],"firstName":"Latifur","lastName":"Khan","id":"37267088800"},{"name":"Murat Kantarcioglu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Kantarcioglu","id":"37279375600"},{"name":"Bhavani Thuraisingham","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Bhavani","lastName":"Thuraisingham","id":"37268636500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8207-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4130-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"5558142","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1465},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Intensive Query Processing for Large RDF Graphs Using Cloud Computing Tools","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558142","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource description framework","Cloud computing","Distributed databases","Data mining","Data models","Ontologies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","query languages","query processing","semantic Web"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data intensive query processing","RDF graphs","cloud computing tools","semantic Web technologies","World Wide Web consortium","resource description framework","hadoop distributed file system","SPARQL protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RDF","Hadoop","Cloud","Semantic Web"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is the newest paradigm in the IT world and hence the focus of new research. Companies hosting cloud computing services face the challenge of handling data intensive applications. Semantic web technologies can be an ideal candidate to be used together with cloud computing tools to provide a solution. These technologies have been standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). One such standard is the Resource Description Framework (RDF). With the explosion of semantic web technologies, large RDF graphs are common place. Current frameworks do not scale for large RDF graphs. In this paper, we describe a framework that we built using Hadoop, a popular open source framework for Cloud Computing, to store and retrieve large numbers of RDF triples. We describe a scheme to store RDF data in Hadoop Distributed File System. We present an algorithm to generate the best possible query plan to answer a SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) query based on a cost model. We use Hadoop's MapReduce framework to answer the queries. Our results show that we can store large RDF graphs in Hadoop clusters built with cheap commodity class hardware. Furthermore, we show that our framework is scalable and efficient and can easily handle billions of RDF triples, unlike traditional approaches.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2010.36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2010.36","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557896/5557954/05558142.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Data Intensive Query Processing for Large RDF Graphs Using Cloud Computing Tools","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499422","htmlLink":"/document/5558142/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Intensive Query Processing for Large RDF Graphs Using Cloud Computing Tools","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4130a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072851S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557896","isNumber":"5557954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557896","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5557954","articleId":"5558142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5558162,"authors":[{"name":"Il-Gu Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Il-Gu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292232000"},{"name":"Minho Cheong","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Minho","lastName":"Cheong","id":"37529438400"},{"name":"Deuk-Su Lyu","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Deuk-Su","lastName":"Lyu","id":"37431393600"},{"name":"Sok-Kyu Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sok-Kyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281134600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7536-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7535-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4089-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5558162","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","OFDM","MIMO","Wireless communication","Wireless LAN","Receivers","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","OFDM modulation","transceivers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF transceiver","wireless nomadic local area networks","wideband transceiver","OFDM method","multiple antennas","bit rate 3.6 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","Giga bps RF","wireless local area networks"]}],"abstract":"We present high data rate wideband transceiver design and experimental evaluation for 3.62 Gbps wireless transmission systems in this paper.

A reasonably wider concurrent pulse is required to achieve a dead-zone free detection. The wider concurrent pulse implies the slow acquisition time PLL. This study presents a novel forward Phase Detector (fPD). The dead-zone-free fPD is operated in two modes: ON (M = 1) and OFF (M = 0). Both input signals INT and EXT are fed into both fPD and CP. The fPD determines the operation mode, while the CP performs the operation of charge/discharge. Two steady signals EXT and INT are used to replace the concurrent pulse in the feedback-path in the C-PFD. Thus, it is a \u201cpulse-less\u201d forward phase detecting scheme. A high-speed PLL with the proposed fPD/CP combination can be achieved. Due to the low disturbance to the Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) control line, the PLL achieves a phase noise of -131 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset when the PLL is operated at 2.3 GHz. The low power fPD/CP also achieves high sensitivity for detecting both frequency and phase.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Frequency measurement","Phase frequency detector","Current measurement","Phase noise","Detectors","Discharges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase locked loops","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward phase detector","phase-locked loops","conventional phase-frequency detector","feedback-path approach","dead-zone free detection","pulse-less forward phase detecting scheme","voltage controlled oscillator control line","frequency 2.3 GHz","frequency 1 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase-locked Loop","Phase-Frequency Detector","Forward Phase Detector","Charge Pump","Dead Zone"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CENICS.2010.13","publicationTitle":"2010 Third International Conference on Advances in Circuits, Electronics and Micro-electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Third International Conference on Advances in Circuits, Electronics and Micro-electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557892/5558157/05558168.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CENICS.2010.13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Forward Phase Detector for GSamples/s Phase-Locked Loops","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558168","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Forward Phase Detector for GSamples/s Phase-Locked Loops","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558168/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5558168/","accessionNumber":"11503051","conferenceDate":"18-25 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Forward Phase Detector for GSamples/s Phase-Locked Loops","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"4089a034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057537S","chronDate":"18-25 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557892","isNumber":"5558157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557892","xplore-issue":"5558157","articleId":"5558168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5558171,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Bochem","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, Sankt Augustin, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Bochem","id":"37545422100"},{"name":"Rainer Herpers","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, Sankt Augustin, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Herpers","id":"37285120900"},{"name":"Kenneth B.

The previous transmissions' events are one of the main motivations for the CR actions and its learning procedures. Therefore, self aware CR devices may cause a considerable interference when they transmit for the first time with no practical knowledge. This paper proposes a solution for cognitive radios with no experiences for instance first run cognitive radios and CR devices repositioned in new wireless environments. A multi-layered learning system is designed using the neural networks to extract cognition from other operator secondary users. Thus, sensors data, other CR devices' data, spectrum governing entities behaviour, in addition to any stored data in the CR are processed for decision comparisons. Final evaluations are based on the weight and significance given to each of these inputs. As a result, full autonomous mature cognitive users are created through understanding other cognitive radios experiments. Simulation was trained to assess the proposed learning model. Results show promising and efficient utilization using gradual learning rate algorithms with the designed system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGMAST.2010.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557924","startPage":"158","endPage":"161","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fourth International Conference on Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557898/5557924/05558219.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Intelligent Scheme for First Run Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5558219/","displayDocTitle":"An Intelligent Scheme for First Run Cognitive Radios","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499526","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intelligent Scheme for First Run Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"4121a158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050246S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557898","isNumber":"5557924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557898","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5557924","articleId":"5558219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5558264,"authors":[{"name":"St\u00e9phane Viollet","affiliation":["Institute of Movement Sciences - Biorobotics, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Viollet","id":"37282373600"},{"name":"Franck Ruffier","affiliation":["Institute of Movement Sciences - Biorobotics, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Ruffier","id":"37282466500"},{"name":"Thomas Ray","affiliation":["Institute of Movement Sciences - Biorobotics, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ray","id":"37276115300"},{"name":"Mohsine Menouni","affiliation":["Center for Particle Physics (CPPM), Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Mohsine","lastName":"Menouni","id":"38299902500"},{"name":"Fabrice Aub\u00e9part","affiliation":["Institute of Movement Sciences - Biorobotics, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Fabrice","lastName":"Aub\u00e9part","id":"37442934900"},{"name":"Lubin Kerhuel","affiliation":["Institute of Movement Sciences - Biorobotics, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Lubin","lastName":"Kerhuel","id":"37397811500"},{"name":"Nicolas Franceschini","affiliation":["Institute of Movement Sciences - Biorobotics, Marseille, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Franceschini","id":"37282399400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7537-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7538-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4096-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5558264","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Optical sensors","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical variables measurement","Pixel","Optical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sensors","image sequences","lighting","mobile robots","path planning","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniature bio-inspired optic flow sensors","natural environments","vision-based navigation systems","optic flow cues","autonomous robotic platforms","custom-made sensors","optical mouse chips","illuminance variations","custom-made aVLSI retina","adaptive pixels for insect-based sensor","bio-inspired visual processing system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optic flow","optical sensor","adaptive pixels","robotics"]}],"abstract":"Considerable attention has been paid during the last decade to vision-based navigation systems based on optic flow (OF) cues. OF-based systems have been implemented on an increasingly large number of sighted autonomous robotic platforms. Nowadays, the OF is measured using conventional cameras, custom-made sensors and even optical mouse chips. However, very few studies have dealt so far with the reliability of these OF sensors in terms of their precision, range and sensitivity to illuminance variations. Three miniature custom-made OF sensors developed at our laboratory, which were composed of photosensors connected to an OF processing unit were tested and compared in this study, focusing on their responses and characteristics in real indoor and outdoor environments in a large range of illuminance. It was concluded that by combining a custom-made aVLSI retina equipped with Adaptive Pixels for Insect-based Sensor (APIS) with a bio-inspired visual processing system, it is possible to obtain highly effective miniature sensors for measuring the OF under real environmental conditions.","doi":"10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2010.15","publicationTitle":"2010 Fourth International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fourth International Conference on Sensor Technologies and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557895/5558025/05558264.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2010.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristics of Three Miniature Bio-inspired Optic Flow Sensors in Natural Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-25 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558264/","displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of Three Miniature Bio-inspired Optic Flow Sensors in Natural Environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11499334","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5558264/","conferenceDate":"18-25 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of Three Miniature Bio-inspired Optic Flow Sensors in Natural Environments","confLoc":"Venice, Italy","sourcePdf":"4096a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08306S","chronDate":"18-25 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557895","isNumber":"5558025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557895","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5558025","articleId":"5558264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5558287,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Nanchang Institute of Technology, NanChang, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Sun","id":"37403476300"},{"name":"Jia Zhao","affiliation":["Nanchang Institute of Technology, NanChang, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37537637400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7078-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7077-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5558287","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558287","abstract":"This article has been retracted by the publisher.","doi":"10.1109/WMSVM.2010.53","startPage":"160","endPage":"163","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Modeling, Simulation and Visualization Methods","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMSVM.2010.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558276","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Modeling, Simulation and Visualization Methods","pdfPath":"/iel5/5558275/5558276/05558287.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Three Sub-swarms Exchange Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Different Evolvement Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558287/","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Three Sub-swarms Exchange Particle Swarm Optimization Based on Different Evolvement Model","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11499655","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","conferenceDate":"15-16 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 May 2010","xploreNote":"Notice of Retraction: After careful and considered review of the content of this paper by a duly constituted expert committee, this paper has been found to be in violation of IEEE's Publication Principles.

It is a technique for using a fibre (or optical device) to carry many separate and independent optical channels. The principle is identical to that used when we tune our television receiver to one of many TV channels. Each channel is transmitted at a different radio frequency and we select between them using a \u201ctuner\u201d which is just a resonant circuit within the TV set. Of course wavelength in the optical world is just the way we choose to refer to frequency and optical WDM is quite identical to radio FDM. Another way of envisaging WDM is to consider that each channel consists of light of a different colour. Thus a WDM system transmits a \u201crainbow\u201d. Actually at the wavelengths involved the light is invisible but it's a good way of describing the principle. For long distance communication to achieve error free reception use of repeaters is essential Repeaters are costly. Here we are using the combination of the optical amplifiers namely Raman and EDFA. By using the combination of these amplifiers with proper gain adjustment we can achieve the greater distance at which repeater can be placed which causes substantial advantage in reducing the no. of spans thereby reducing the whole cost for communication setup. Optical Amplifiers amplifies the optical signal Noise and distortion also amplified by it.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Optical pumping","Optical receivers","Optical polarization","Stimulated emission","Optical distortion","Optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre networks","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WDM system","optical amplifier","wavelength division multiplexing","optical networking","optical channels","television receiver","TV channels","radio FDM","Raman amplifier","EDFA amplifier","optical signal noise","Er"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WDM","EDFA","DWDM"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMEE.2010.5558438","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5551986/5558392/05558438.pdf","startPage":"V2-232","endPage":"V2-236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEE.2010.5558438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WDM and optical amplifier (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"WDM and optical amplifier (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558438/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5558438/","accessionNumber":"11499907","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WDM and optical amplifier (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"053V2M245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042172S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5551986","isNumber":"5558392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5551986","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5558392","articleId":"5558438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5558474,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Amin","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology, Sharif University of Technology, Kish, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Amin","id":"37546834500"},{"name":"Amir A.

It will be shown that the recognition rate is only lose a little but reduce much computing time.","doi":"10.1109/ICMEE.2010.5558498","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5551986/5558392/05558498.pdf","startPage":"V2-6","endPage":"V2-10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEE.2010.5558498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The speech recognition chip implementation on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558498/","displayDocTitle":"The speech recognition chip implementation on FPGA","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11499962","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5558498/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The speech recognition chip implementation on FPGA","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"004V2M064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051686S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5551986","isNumber":"5558392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5551986","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5558392","articleId":"5558498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5558538,"authors":[{"name":"Kee-Hoon Jang","affiliation":["Department of Embedded Software Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kee-Hoon Jang","id":"37532573400"},{"name":"Tae Hee Han","affiliation":["Department of Embedded Software Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae Hee Han","id":"37395397700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7481-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7479-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5558538","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":762},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Flash memory","Companies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","greedy algorithms","hard discs","logic gates","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["garbage collection policy","block management method","NAND flash memories","hard disks","embedded systems","limited block erase count","in-place update impossibility","operation granularity","block wear leveling","hot data","cold data","warm data","greedy algorithm","PCP algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NAND flash memory","Garbage collection","Wear leveling","Block management method"]}],"abstract":"Recently NAND flash memories are widely used as storage alternatives to hard disks in embedded systems. Different characteristics of NAND flash memories from hard disks include: a limited block erase count, the impossibility of in-place update, and asymmetry in operation granularity. Thus various garbage collection techniques for the NAND flash memories have been proposed. However, existing garbage collection techniques impede block wear leveling because they use the same method for both hot and cold data. In this paper, we propose efficient garbage collection and block management methods to improve block wear leveling and garbage collection speed. First of all, data are classified into three types according to modification frequency--hot data, cold data, and warm data--and different types of data are stored in different blocks. The erase cost is calculated considering data type, and then garbage collection is performed for the blocks whose erase costs exceed the threshold value. In addition, different block lists are created in RAM by data type, and the blocks are arranged in the order of their erase cost. In experiment results, the proposed methods show that the deviation value of block erase count is sharply reduced in comparison with other algorithms. The average time of the garbage collection decreases by up to 22.1% compares to the Greedy algorithm and up to 19.5% compares to the PCP algorithm.","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5551986/5558502/05558538.pdf","startPage":"V1-327","endPage":"V1-331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEE.2010.5558538","doi":"10.1109/ICMEE.2010.5558538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient garbage collection policy and block management method for NAND flash memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient garbage collection policy and block management method for NAND flash memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558538/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5558538/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11500060","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient garbage collection policy and block management method for NAND flash memory","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"074V1M141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090755S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5551986","isNumber":"5558502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5551986","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5558502","articleId":"5558538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5558580,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Jung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Jung Chen","id":"37539319400"},{"name":"Tsui-Tsai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tsui-Tsai Lin","id":"37291209500"},{"name":"Tung-Chou Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communications Engineering, National Changhua University of Education, Changhua, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tung-Chou Chen","id":"37438604300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7481-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7479-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5558580","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","fading channels","multipath channels","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind joint frequency offset estimation","channel estimation","MC-CDMA systems","multipath fading channels","robust blind receiver","code division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a robust blind receiver incorporating a two-stage carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation scheme is proposed for multi-carrier code-division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems over a multipath fading channel.

However, it has some limitations, for example, the units of its read/write operation and erase operation do not match, which lowers its performance. Furthermore, it cannot perform the in-place overwrite operation and has a limited number of erase operations. Thus, additional software techniques are required to use NAND flash memory, and numerous studies were recently conducted on hybrid architecture using NAND flash and the next-generation non-volatile memory. In this paper, it is suggested that a hot data detection layer be added to a software layer based on the NAND flash hybrid architecture with PRAM (Phase-changed RAM). The hot data detection layer is used to detect hot data and then place this data on PRAM. The simulation results showed that the read performance of the suggested method improved by 12.74%, and its write performance by 17.78% compared to existing methods. The number of erase operations was also reduced by 8.18%.","doi":"10.1109/ICMEE.2010.5558587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMEE.2010.5558587","endPage":"V1-97","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Mechanical and Electronics Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5551986/5558502/05558587.pdf","startPage":"V1-93","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PRAM and NAND flash hybrid architecture based on hot data detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558587/","displayDocTitle":"PRAM and NAND flash hybrid architecture based on hot data detection","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11500008","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5558587/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PRAM and NAND flash hybrid architecture based on hot data detection","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"023V1M059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056072S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5551986","isNumber":"5558502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5551986","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5558502","articleId":"5558587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5558589,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Initially the input is sampled, filtered, windowed and Perceptual Linear Predictive Coefficients are determined for each frame. These coefficients are applied as input to the SOFM neural network. The output of this network is given to BPN neural network comprising of 3 layers for learning. The network has been trained with five words uttered by five different deaf persons in the age group of 5-10 years. Another set of same five words uttered by same five deaf persons were used for test purposes. The recognition results for the word one, three, four is 50 to 60% and for five is 50%...But the recognition results for word two are only10% since the variability is high for two.

To satisfy the required system throughput, the packet assembler and the regular expression matching are implemented by the dedicated hardware. On the other hand, the counting of matching results and the system control are implemented by a microprocessor. A regular expression matching circuit is performed as follows: First, the given regular expressions are converted into a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA). Then, to reduce the number of states, the NFA is converted to a modular non-deterministic finite automaton (MNFA(p)) with p-character-consuming transition. Finally, a finite-input memory machine (FIMM) to detect p-characters is generated, and the matching elements (MEs) realizing the states for the MNFA(p) are generated. We loaded 140 regular expressions of the MEMOCODE 2010 design contest on Terasic Corp. DE3 prototyping board (FPGA: Altera's Stratix III).

Advancements in the mechanism and the control method of trans-femoral prostheses have drastically improved the gait of amputees. However, realization of a natural gait has not been investigated in detail even though such smooth gait is important to increase the amputee's activities of daily living (ADL). Inertia of the prosthesis plays an important role in natural and smooth gaits during the swing phase. We suppose that goodness of gait or easiness of walking is strongly related to effective use of the prosthesis inertia. In this paper, we will attempt to quantify matching of inertia property of the prosthesis to a given user's skill / condition from the effective use of the prosthesis inertia during gait in the swing phase. Gaits of an expert prosthesis user will be measured by changing inertia properties. Effective use of inertia property of the prosthesis in gait is evaluated by closeness of the gait to the inertia-induced motion using inertia-induced measure. In addition gait of a novice prosthesis user will be measured to compare with the expert's results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCME.2010.5558836","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550966/5558820/05558836.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCME.2010.5558836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of inertia matching of trans-femoral prosthesis based on Riemannian distance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558836/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of inertia matching of trans-femoral prosthesis based on Riemannian distance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11519874","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5558836/","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of inertia matching of trans-femoral prosthesis based on Riemannian distance","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"047IEEECME2010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052598S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550966","isNumber":"5558820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550966","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5558820","articleId":"5558836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5558837,"authors":[{"name":"Bikash C.

It may be defined as the use of electronic information and communication technologies to provide and support health care when the patient and the specialists are remotely located. The Telemedicine system requires internet connectivity at the doctor and health worker ends. WiMAX is able to provide ubiquitous internet access allowing end users to be connected to the internet independently of their location, including rural and impervious areas where the deployment of a wired access solution would not be economically feasible. This paper focuses on Simulation based analysis of IEEE802.16-2004/WMAN-OFDM PHY layer. Specifically it aims at quantifying the improvement of PHY layer performance, evaluated in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) versus Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), with respect to the different channel models. The simulation was done using MATLAB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel based Simulation and analysis of IEEE802.16 (WiMAX) \u2014 2004/WMAN-OFDM physical layer for BWA to support Telemedicine","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICCME.2010.5558837","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ICME International Conference on Complex Medical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550966/5558820/05558837.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCME.2010.5558837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558820","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Channel based Simulation and analysis of IEEE802.16 (WiMAX) \u2014 2004/WMAN-OFDM physical layer for BWA to support Telemedicine","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5558837/","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11519875","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel based Simulation and analysis of IEEE802.16 (WiMAX) \u2014 2004/WMAN-OFDM physical layer for BWA to support Telemedicine","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"044IEEECME2010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056099S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550966","isNumber":"5558820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550966","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5558820","articleId":"5558837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5558839,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Braithwaite","affiliation":["University of Southern Queensland, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Braithwaite","id":"37531737900"},{"name":"Ron Addie","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computing, University of Southern Queensland, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Addie","id":"37348891400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6843-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6841-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6842-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5558839","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5558839","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Channel estimation","Estimation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","echo suppression","mean square error methods","telemedicine","telephony","total energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test signal optimal choice","channel estimation","linear transmission channel","echo channel","optimal linear estimator","associated test signal","mean-squared error","optimization","autocovariance","power spectrum","total energy"]}],"abstract":"We examine the problem of determining the characteristics a slowly varying linear transmission channel by measuring the output when the input is a specially selected test signal.

Applying data mining and machine learning techniques to network intrusion detection often faces the problem of very large training dataset size. For example, the training dataset commonly used for the DARPA KDD-1999 offline intrusion detection project contained approximately five hundred thousand (10% sample of the original five million) observations, which were used to build intrusion detection classification models. The practical problems associated with such a large dataset include very long model training times, redundant information, and increased complexity in understanding the domain-specific data. We demonstrate that a simple active learning procedure can dramatically reduce the size of the training data, without significantly sacrificing the classification accuracy of the intrusion detection model. A case study of the DARPA KDD-1999 intrusion detection project is used in our work. The network traffic instances are classified into one of two categories - normal and attack. A comparison of the actively trained neural network model with a C4.5 decision tree indicated that the actively learned model had better generalization accuracy. In addition, the training data classification performance of the actively learned model was comparable to that of the C4.5 decision tree.","doi":"10.1109/IRI.2010.5558967","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550513/5558895/05558967.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"54","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse & Integration","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRI.2010.5558967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5558895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active learning with neural networks for intrusion detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5558967/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Active learning with neural networks for intrusion detection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11499807","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5558967/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active learning with neural networks for intrusion detection","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"009082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092309S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550513","isNumber":"5558895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550513","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5558895","articleId":"5558967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5558995,"authors":[{"name":"Jaap van de Beek","affiliation":["Huawei Technol.

For these situations, High Dynamic Range (HDR) images can be generated by taking multiple exposures of the same scene. When fusing information from different images, however, the slightest change in the scene can generate artifacts which dramatically limit the potential of this solution. We present a technique capable of dealing with a large amount of movement in the scene: we find, in all the available exposures, patches consistent with a reference image previously selected from the stack. We generate the HDR image by averaging the radiance estimates of all such regions and we compensate for camera calibration errors by removing potential seams. We show that our method works even in cases when many moving objects cover large regions of the scene.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550965/5559002/05559003.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","doi":"10.1109/ICCPHOT.2009.5559003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPHOT.2009.5559003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559002","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artifact-free High Dynamic Range imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Cameras","Dynamic range","Image color analysis","Estimation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image motion analysis","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic range imaging","consumer cameras","high dynamic range","HDR","image reference","camera calibration errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Artifact-free High Dynamic Range imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559003/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"11499067","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","conferenceDate":"16-17 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artifact-free High Dynamic Range imaging","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"origresearch14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049776S","chronDate":"16-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5550965","isNumber":"5559002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550965","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5559002","articleId":"5559003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5559006,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit Gupta","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37536161200"},{"name":"Pravin Bhat","affiliation":["University of Konstanz, Germany"],"firstName":"Pravin","lastName":"Bhat","id":"37543338300"},{"name":"Mira Dontcheva","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Mira","lastName":"Dontcheva","id":"37546957000"},{"name":"Oliver Deussen","affiliation":["University of Washington, USA"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Deussen","id":"37266781000"},{"name":"Brian Curless","affiliation":["Adobe Systems, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Curless","id":"37333354000"},{"name":"Michael Cohen","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37087396106"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4533-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5559006","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Spatial resolution","Cameras","Pixel","Optical imaging","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image reconstruction","image resolution","image sequences","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spacetime resolution","video temporal resolution","consumer-level hybrid cameras","high-resolution stills","low-resolution video","high-quality optical flow algorithm","high-quality image-based-rendering algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing and experiencing spacetime resolution with videos and stills","doi":"10.1109/ICCPHOT.2009.5559006","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550965/5559002/05559006.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPHOT.2009.5559006","abstract":"We present solutions for enhancing the spatial and/or temporal resolution of videos.

The consequent assumption is that each microlens image is completely defocused with respect to to the image created by the main camera lens and the outside object. As a result, only a single pixel in the final image can be rendered from it, resulting in disappointingly low resolution. In this paper, we present a new approach to lightfield capture and image rendering that interprets the microlens array as an imaging system focused on the focal plane of the main camera lens. This approach captures a lightfield with significantly higher spatial resolution than the traditional approach, allowing us to render high resolution images that meet the expectations of modern photographers. Although the new approach samples the lightfield with reduced angular density, analysis and experimental results demonstrate that there is sufficient parallax to completely support lightfield manipulation algorithms such as refocusing and novel views.","doi":"10.1109/ICCPHOT.2009.5559008","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550965/5559002/05559008.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPHOT.2009.5559008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The focused plenoptic camera","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559008","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559008/","displayDocTitle":"The focused plenoptic camera","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"11499059","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559008/","conferenceDate":"16-17 April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The focused plenoptic camera","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"origresearch11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065317S","chronDate":"16-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5550965","isNumber":"5559002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550965","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"5559002","articleId":"5559008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5559010,"authors":[{"name":"Tom E.

In a single snapshot these cameras provide a sample of the light field of a scene by trading off spatial resolution with angular resolution. Current methods produce images at a resolution that is much lower than that of traditional imaging devices. However, by explicitly modeling the image formation process and incorporating priors such as Lambertianity and texture statistics, these types of images can be reconstructed at a higher resolution. We formulate this method in a variational Bayesian framework and perform the reconstruction of both the surface of the scene and the (superresolved) light field. The method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real images captured with our light-field camera prototype.","doi":"10.1109/ICCPHOT.2009.5559010","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550965/5559002/05559010.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCPHOT.2009.5559010","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559002","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Light field superresolution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Light field superresolution","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559010/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-17 April 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"11499060","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5559010/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light field superresolution","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"origresearch09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068808S","chronDate":"16-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5550965","isNumber":"5559002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550965","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5559002","articleId":"5559010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5559016,"authors":[{"name":"Roarke Horstmeyer","affiliation":["The MITRE Corporation"],"firstName":"Roarke","lastName":"Horstmeyer","id":"37546879100"},{"name":"Gary Euliss","affiliation":["The MITRE Corporation"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Euliss","id":"37370192500"},{"name":"Ravindra Athale","affiliation":["The MITRE Corporation"],"firstName":"Ravindra","lastName":"Athale","id":"37374280900"},{"name":"Marc Levoy","affiliation":["Stanford University"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Levoy","id":"37282931600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4534-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4533-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5559016","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":28,"totalDownloads":813},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image reconstruction","optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible multimodal camera","light field architecture","multiple filters","synthetic images reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"We present a modified conventional camera that is able to collect multimodal images in a single exposure.

The ease with which these filters can be exchanged and reconfigured provides a high degree of flexibility in the type of information that can be collected with each image. This paper explores the various tradeoffs involved in implementing a pinhole array in parallel with a pupil-plane filter array to measure multi-dimensional optical data from a scene.

In order to recover scene details from defocused regions, deblurring techniques must be applied. It is well known that the quality of a deblurred image is closely related to the defocus kernel, which is determined by the pattern of the aperture. The design of aperture patterns has been studied for decades in several fields, including optics, astronomy, computer vision, and computer graphics. However, previous attempts at designing apertures have been based on intuitive criteria related to the shape of the power spectrum of the aperture pattern. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for evaluating an aperture pattern based on the quality of deblurring. Our criterion explicitly accounts for the effects of image noise and the statistics of natural images. Based on our criterion, we have developed a genetic algorithm that converges very quickly to near-optimal aperture patterns. We have conducted extensive simulations and experiments to compare our apertures with previously proposed ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 April 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-17 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5559018/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"11499066","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"What are good apertures for defocus deblurring?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What are good apertures for defocus deblurring?","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"origresearch01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073686S","chronDate":"16-17 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5550965","isNumber":"5559002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550965","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5559002","articleId":"5559018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5559069,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Hsuan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Meng Hsuan","lastName":"Lee","id":"38256943600"},{"name":"Chia-Hsien Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsien","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37308103600"},{"name":"Yu-Cheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Cheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37310155700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5530-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5528-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5529-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6964"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6972"}],"articleNumber":"5559069","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Gallium nitride","Biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emulsions","microfluidics","spraying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alginate emulsion","electrospraying","microfluidic chip","microfluidic cross-junction","continuous phase flow rate","standard deviation","Taylor cone"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alginate","Emulsion","Taylor cone","Electrospraying"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, utilizing the microfluidic cross-junction and high electric field to generate uniform emulsions is reported.

The proposed controller comprised fuzzy logic proportional and derivative controller with the conventional Proportional and integral controller (FUZZY PD+PI). The FUZZY PD terms improve the stability of the system, reduce the overshoot, and increase the transient response of the system. The conventional integral (I) term is responsible for eliminating a steady-state error while the proportional term will have the effect of reducing the rise time and will also reduce a steady-state error. The proposed control scheme optimize the FPID control parameters, KP, KI and K to obtain the best control effect by minimizing the integral time square error online. The performance of the proposed hybrid control in increasing the damping of local and inter-area modes of oscillation is demonstrated in a practical reduce system of south Malaysian power network called TNB 25-bus system.","doi":"10.1109/PEOCO.2010.5559207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEOCO.2010.5559207","startPage":"19","endPage":"25","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 4th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference (PEOCO)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5538456/5559154/05559207.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 4th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference (PEOCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system damping using fuzzy controlled TCSC device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Power system damping using fuzzy controlled TCSC device","conferenceDate":"23-24 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559207/","accessionNumber":"11490112","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559207/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system damping using fuzzy controlled TCSC device","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058141S","chronDate":"23-24 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5538456","isNumber":"5559154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5538456","xplore-issue":"5559154","articleId":"5559207","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5559232,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is a method of determine the most efficient, low cost and reliable operation of a power system by dispatching the available electricity generation resources to supply the load on the system. The primary objective of economic dispatch is to minimize the total cost of generation while maintaining the operational constraints of the available generation resources. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization algorithms (PSO) with one of the accelerating coefficients being constant are proposed to solve the economic power dispatch problem. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is algorithms modeled on swarm intelligence that finds a solution to an optimization problem in a search space, or model and predict social behavior in the presence of objectives.

In some previous works for reconfiguration of distribution networks with several loops, loops are one by one selected and reconfiguration at each matched loop is performed according to the simple branch exchange method of the single loop. Although the loops selection sequence affects the optimal configuration and the power loss of the network, the loops selection sequence is not incorporated in the network reconfiguration problems up to now. In this paper, the sequence of the loops selection is optimized for the maximum loss reduction and a simple branch exchange method is employed for reconfiguration in each loop. Discrete Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the sequence of the loops selection. The proposed algorithm is effectively tested on two feeder of a real 77-bus distribution network of the city of Sirjan in Iran.","doi":"10.1109/PEOCO.2010.5559255","pdfPath":"/iel5/5538456/5559154/05559255.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 4th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference (PEOCO)","publicationTitle":"2010 4th International Power Engineering and Optimization Conference (PEOCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEOCO.2010.5559255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved reconfiguration method for maximum loss reduction using Discrete Genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"An improved reconfiguration method for maximum loss reduction using Discrete Genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11490160","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5559255/","conferenceDate":"23-24 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved reconfiguration method for maximum loss reduction using Discrete Genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Shah Alam, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068217S","chronDate":"23-24 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5538456","isNumber":"5559154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5538456","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5559154","articleId":"5559255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5559267,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Pechenkin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering/TRLaboratories, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Pechenkin","id":"37546764200"},{"name":"Ivan J.

Because of the small subcarrier spacing associated with OFDM, a significant fraction of FWM processes is well matched, resulting in a rapid buildup of FWM light with propagation distance. In this paper, we consider optical phase conjugation (OPC) as an approach to suppress such well-matched FWM processes. An analytical formula accurately predicting the degree of suppression is derived and discussed. It is shown that when combined with the methods previously proposed in the literature, the application of OPC can dramatically reduce the overall FWM power accumulated within the link for a wide range of crucial design parameters.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.2.000701","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/5572011/05559267.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.2.000701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5572011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Four-Wave Mixing Suppression in Fiber-Optic OFDM Transmission Systems With an Optical Phase Conjugation Module","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559267/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Four-Wave Mixing Suppression in Fiber-Optic OFDM Transmission Systems With an Optical Phase Conjugation Module","volume":"2","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11674417","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559267/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Four-Wave Mixing Suppression in Fiber-Optic OFDM Transmission Systems With an Optical Phase Conjugation Module","sourcePdf":"701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066923S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5572011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5572011","articleId":"5559267","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5559270,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Moradi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Oklahama, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Moradi","id":"37338211400"},{"name":"Hazem H.

Currently, although most approaches provide high detection performance in terms of bit error, receiver design is difficult to implement. This paper proposes two practical thresholding-based detection schemes, which offer significant improvement to receiver throughput on a computational load basis when CSI is not available. The first is based on a simple maximum likelihood (ML) function where the bit error rate (BER) is the same as conventional symbol-by-symbol detection. This method, however, causes a loss of BER performance. The second uses the aid of pilot-symbol-assisted modulation (PSAM) to modify the ML function when channel coefficients are temporally correlated. While numerical analysis based on this method shows that the BER performance in a log-normally distributed fading channel is very close to detection achieved with perfect CSI, the receiver suffers from increased complexity. If random processes for fading and noise are assumed as stationary and given that the detection threshold is quickly calculated and applied during a given period, such complexity of PSAM-based and symbol-by-symbol detection methods can be reduced.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.2.000689","publicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/5572011/05559270.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.2.000689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5572011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thresholding-Based Optimal Detection of Wireless Optical Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559270/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","displayDocTitle":"Thresholding-Based Optimal Detection of Wireless Optical Signals","volume":"2","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11674416","htmlLink":"/document/5559270/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thresholding-Based Optimal Detection of Wireless Optical Signals","sourcePdf":"689.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08733S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5572011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5572011","articleId":"5559270","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5559289,"authors":[{"name":"Yanqiang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of information science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanqiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292451100"},{"name":"Dongmei Sun","affiliation":["Institute of information science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongmei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37290810000"},{"name":"Zhengding Qiu","affiliation":["Institute of information science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengding","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37286155900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7065-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7063-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7064-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5559289","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559289","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingers","Biometrics","Principal component analysis","Feature extraction","Transforms","Fuses","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","feature extraction","image recognition","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hand-based feature level fusion","single sample biometrics recognition","palmprint","middle finger image","manifold learning method","local embedding subspaces","principal component analysis","cumulative match characteristic curves"]}],"abstract":"Single sample biometrics recognition may lead to bad recognition result in real-world applications. To solve this problem, we present a novel feature level biometrics fusion approach by combining two kinds of biometrics: palmprint and middle finger image, both of which can be acquired from one hand image. We first utilize a manifold learning method to find the local embedding subspaces of palmprint and middle finger images, and then use principal component analysis (PCA) to extract the concatenated feature. To do so, a well performance could be obtained for the reason that the local structures of single model biometrics are preserved, while the redundancies between them are reduced. Comparing with single modal biometrics and score level fusion, the experimental results illustrated the average recognition rate of the proposed approach was significantly promoted to 98.71%.

As cloud computing becomes more widespread, the energy consumption of the network and computing resources that underpin the cloud will grow. This is happening at a time when there is increasing attention being paid to the need to manage energy consumption across the entire information and communications technology (ICT) sector. While data center energy use has received much attention recently, there has been less attention paid to the energy consumption of the transmission and switching networks that are key to connecting users to the cloud. In this paper, we present an analysis of energy consumption in cloud computing. The analysis considers both public and private clouds, and includes energy consumption in switching and transmission as well as data processing and data storage. We show that energy consumption in transport and switching can be a significant percentage of total energy consumption in cloud computing. Cloud computing can enable more energy-efficient use of computing power, especially when the computing tasks are of low intensity or infrequent. However, under some circumstances cloud computing can consume more energy than conventional computing where each user performs all computing on their own personal computer (PC).","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559320/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11698368","volume":"99","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Green Cloud Computing: Balancing Energy in Processing, Storage, and Transport","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green Cloud Computing: Balancing Energy in Processing, Storage, and Transport","sourcePdf":"jproc-baliga-2060451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110133S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5669979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"499","xplore-issue":"5669979","articleId":"5559320","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5559322,"authors":[{"name":"Bingqing Liang","affiliation":["Department of Geography and Geology, Mansfield University of Pennsylvania, Mansfield, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/5737815/5559322/5559322-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bingqing Liang was born in Zhanjiang, China, in 1978.

Physical environmental variables such as land use and land cover data, land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, and other transformed remote sensing variables were derived from the two Landsat images taken in 1991 and 2000. Socioeconomic variables including population density, house characteristics, income, and education level were extracted from US census 1990 and 2000 block group (BG) data. Correlation analysis and factor analysis were performed after the two groups of variables were integrated at the BG level. For each year, four factors were identified and interpreted as greenness, crowdedness, economic status, and scenic amenity. By assigning different weights to each factor, two synthetic UEQ indexes were generated. A comparison of the two synthetic indexes revealed significant changes in UEQ pattern from 1990 to 2000.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5559322/","accessionNumber":"11874926","displayDocTitle":"Assessing Urban Environmental Quality Change of Indianapolis, United States, by the Remote Sensing and GIS Integration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing Urban Environmental Quality Change of Indianapolis, United States, by the Remote Sensing and GIS Integration","sourcePdf":"jstars-liang-2060316-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106754S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"5737815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5737815","articleId":"5559322","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5559323,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Tzanidis","affiliation":["ElectroScience Laboratory, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Tzanidis","id":"37395688400"},{"name":"Kubilay Sertel","affiliation":["ElectroScience Laboratory, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Kubilay","lastName":"Sertel","id":"37281512700"},{"name":"John L.

To reduce the fabrication cost, digital CMOS processes may be used. Due to the lack of thick top metal and the reduced distance between the top metal and silicon substrates in a digital CMOS, the design of high-performance passives becomes very challenging, particularly in the millimeter-wave frequency regime. In this letter, passives with novel structures were fabricated in a 45-nm digital CMOS process. These passives, including transmission lines, spiral inductors, and metal-oxide-metal (MOM) capacitors, were designed and characterized up to 110 GHz. Their performance was compared with those fabricated using 180- and 90-nm RF CMOS processes. These passives achieved good performance in the millimeter-wave regime. A MOM capacitor has a self-resonant frequency higher than 110 GHz. An inductor achieves a quality factor of 24 at 70 GHz. These results show the feasibility of implementing the millimeterwave passives and systems in a 45-nm digital CMOS process.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2010.2058993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/5584935/05559330.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2010.2058993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5584935","startPage":"1080","endPage":"1082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Passives in 45-nm Digital CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Passives in 45-nm Digital CMOS","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534927","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5559330/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Passives in 45-nm Digital CMOS","sourcePdf":"led-shi-2058993-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114941S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"5584935","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5584935","articleId":"5559330","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559343,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Wen Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National I-Lan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5617337/5559343/5559343-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chien-Wen Chiu (M'98) was born in Maoli, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1962.

In particular, locally-conformal algorithms based on the computation of effective material parameters in partially-filled FDTD cells are attractive because they are simple to implement and maintain the basic conditional stability of FDTD, with only minor changes on the Courant limit. In this paper, we propose a new locally-conformal implementation for FDTD tailored for anisotropic conductive interfaces. Instead of employing arithmetic or geometrical averages, we invoke the quasi-static relationship between the current density and the electric field to derive the effective conductivities of partially-filled FDTD cells.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5617337/05559361.pdf","startPage":"3658","endPage":"3665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2071362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2071362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Locally-Conformal FDTD for Anisotropic Conductive Interfaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Conductivity","Geometry","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Tensile stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anisotropic media","conformal antennas","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anisotropic conductive interface","finite difference time domain method","FDTD method","electric field"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anisotropic media","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","staircasing approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Locally-Conformal FDTD for Anisotropic Conductive Interfaces","volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5559361/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623432","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally-Conformal FDTD for Anisotropic Conductive Interfaces","sourcePdf":"tap-teixeira-2071362-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124786S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5617337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5617337","articleId":"5559361","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559369,"authors":[{"name":"YuFeng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electro-Mechanical Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/5742735/5559369/5559369-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["YuFeng Chen received the B.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2006.

This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient method to design optimal control places, and an iteration approach that only computes the reachability graph of a plant Petri net model once in order to obtain a maximally permissive liveness-enforcing supervisor for an FMS. By using a vector covering approach, a minimal covering set of legal markings and a minimal covered set of first-met bad markings (FBM) are computed. At each iteration, an FBM from the minimal covered set is selected. By solving an integer linear programming problem, a place invariant is designed to prevent the FBM from being reached and no marking in the minimal covering set of legal markings is forbidden. This process is carried out until no FBM can be reached. In order to make the considered problem computationally tractable, binary decision diagrams (BDD) are used to compute the sets of legal markings and FBM, and solve the vector covering problem to get a minimal covering set of legal markings and a minimal covered set of FBM. Finally, a number of FMS examples are presented to illustrate the proposed approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2010.2060332","startPage":"374","endPage":"393","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/8856/5742735/05559369.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2010.2060332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5742735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Maximally Permissive Liveness- Enforcing Petri Net Supervisor for Flexible Manufacturing Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Law","System recovery","Petri nets","Computational modeling","Data structures","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary decision diagrams","flexible manufacturing systems","integer programming","iterative methods","linear programming","Petri nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design","maximally permissive liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor","flexible manufacturing systems","iteration method","first-met bad markings","integer linear programming","binary decision diagrams","legal markings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Petri net","flexible manufacturing system (FMS)","deadlock prevention","binary decision diagram (BDD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559369/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Maximally Permissive Liveness- Enforcing Petri Net Supervisor for Flexible Manufacturing Systems","volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5559369/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2011","accessionNumber":"11910087","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Maximally Permissive Liveness- Enforcing Petri Net Supervisor for Flexible Manufacturing Systems","sourcePdf":"tase-chen-2060332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.271116S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"5742735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"5742735","articleId":"5559369","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":5559377,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua D.

The length of the radiating waveguide in the center-feed antenna is half of that of a conventional end-feed antenna, and the center-feed antenna is expected to enhance bandwidth depending on the long line effect. The symmetrical structure of the antenna can keep the main beam at boresight as the frequency is changed. The cross-junction is analogous to that previously proposed for a single-mode waveguide array, but it excites plane TEM waves in both directions in the oversized parallel plate. The authors have designed and fabricated a slot array with uniform aperture distribution at 61.25 GHz. The bandwidth for 1-dB gain reduction is 1.7 times as wide as that of a conventional end-feed type antenna. The sidelobe level in the E-plane increases to -7.8 dB because of the slot-free area over the center-feed waveguide, which is suppressed to -11.1 dB by introducing a -8.3 dB amplitude tapered distribution in the slot design of the array.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Post-Wall Waveguide Center-Feed Parallel Plate Slot Array Antenna in the Millimeter-Wave Band","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2071356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5617337/05559379.pdf","startPage":"3532","endPage":"3538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2071356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Post-Wall Waveguide Center-Feed Parallel Plate Slot Array Antenna in the Millimeter-Wave Band","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5559379/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623442","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Post-Wall Waveguide Center-Feed Parallel Plate Slot Array Antenna in the Millimeter-Wave Band","sourcePdf":"tap-hashimoto-2071356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.404806S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5617337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5617337","articleId":"5559379","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5559382,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Zito","affiliation":["University College Cork, Cork, Ireland","Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Zito","id":"37296283100"},{"name":"Alessandro Fonte","affiliation":["University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Fonte","id":"37332414600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5559382","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":688},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"A dual-input low noise amplifier (DILNA) topology with pseudo-switch capability is presented.

Industry reports indicate that approximately 50%-70% of soldering defects are attributed to the solder paste printing process for printed circuit board (PCB) assembly. Hence, after the printing process, a solder paste inspection (SPI) system is generally used to examine the amount of solder paste deposition. Effective selection of components and bonding pads during solder inspection is extremely important in achieving desired process cycle times and ensuring assembly yield. This paper uses the Mahalanobis-Taguchi system to establish a systematic approach to determining guidelines for solder paste inspection. Among a total of 203 bonding pads on the board for a GPS product, the optimal model suggests that the solder deposition of 121 bonding pads be inspected. The reduction ratio is 40.4%, and the feasibility of the proposed model is verified. Also, for those bonding pads to be inspected for their solder paste deposition, this study uses empirical data to define the specifications to effectively distinguish acceptable PCB samples from defective. The threshold is within the 100% capability for judgment of solder paste printing quality in the surface mount assembly process.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5625011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104/5625011/05559398.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEPM.2010.2055873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEPM.2010.2055873","startPage":"265","endPage":"274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Solder Paste Inspection in Surface-Mount Assembly Through Mahalanobis\u2013Taguchi Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559398/","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Solder Paste Inspection in Surface-Mount Assembly Through Mahalanobis\u2013Taguchi Analysis","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559398/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11656124","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Solder Paste Inspection in Surface-Mount Assembly Through Mahalanobis\u2013Taguchi Analysis","sourcePdf":"tepm-huang-2055873-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094861S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"5625011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5625011","articleId":"5559398","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5559400,"authors":[{"name":"Hisao Ishibuchi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/5648510/5559400/5559400-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hisao Ishibuchi (M'93\u2013SM'10) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in precision mechanics from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 1985 and 1987, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan, in 1992.","Since 1987, he has been with Osaka Prefecture University, where he was a Research Associate, an Assistant Professor, and an Associate Professor.

Traditional mask-based crossover operators for binary strings (e.g., one-point, two-point, and uniform) tend to decrease the spread of solutions along the Pareto front in EMO algorithms while they improve the convergence to part of the Pareto front. This is because such a crossover operator, which is called geometric crossover, always generates an offspring in the segment between its two parents under the Hamming distance in the genotype space. That is, the sum of the distances from the generated offspring to its two parents is always equal to the distance between the two parents. In this paper, we first propose a non-geometric binary crossover operator to generate an offspring outside the segment between its two parents. Next, we show some properties of our crossover operator. Then we examine its effects on the behavior of EMO algorithms through computational experiments on knapsack problems with two, four, and six objectives. Experimental results show that our crossover operator can increase the spread of solutions along the Pareto front in EMO algorithms without severely degrading their convergence property. As a result, our crossover operator improves some overall performance measures such as the hypervolume.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11675038","htmlLink":"/document/5559400/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Diversity Improvement by Non-Geometric Binary Crossover in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity Improvement by Non-Geometric Binary Crossover in Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-hishibuchi-2043365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093453S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5648510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5648510","articleId":"5559400","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559401,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, the Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronics Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407464100"},{"name":"Jintao Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, the Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronics Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jintao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539000300"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, the Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronics Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292907900"},{"name":"Yangang Li","affiliation":["Applied Science and Technology Research Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yangang","lastName":"Li","id":"37405706900"},{"name":"Shigang Tang","affiliation":["Applied Science and Technology Research Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shigang","lastName":"Tang","id":"37286739400"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, the Tsinghua National Laboratory of Information Science and Technology (TNList), Department of Electronics Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37290858000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9316"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9611"}],"articleNumber":"5559401","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Broadcast Technology Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/bt/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559401","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Receivers","Digital TV","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Multimedia communication","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital video broadcasting","mobile communication","multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded transmission","DTMB system","mobile services","digital television terrestrial multimedia broadcasting","multiservice datacasting scheme","terrestrial DTV programs","package identifier","mobile receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backward compatibility","datacasting","digital television terrestrial multimedia broadcasting (DTMB)","multi-services","package identifier (PID)"]}],"abstract":"To efficiently support the transmission of terrestrial and mobile services within the same spectrum over the Digital Television Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) system, a flexible multi-service datacasting scheme in a backward compatible manner is proposed.

The method utilizes an impedance framework, such that the joint can be programmed with a given stiffness and damping that reflects the nominal impedance properties of an intact joint. Volitional movement of the knee joint is commanded via the stiffness set-point angle of the joint impedance, which is commanded by the user as a function of the measured surface electromyogram (EMG) from the hamstring and quadriceps muscles of the residual limb. Rather than using the respective EMG measurements from these muscles to directly command the flexion or extension set point of the knee, the presented approach utilizes a combination of quadratic discriminant analysis and principal component analysis to align the user's intent to flex or extend the knee joint with the pattern of measured EMG. The approach was implemented on three transfemoral amputees, and their ability to control knee movement was characterized by a set of knee joint trajectory tracking tasks. Each amputee subject also performed the same set of trajectory tracking tasks with his sound side (intact) knee joint. The average root mean square trajectory tracking errors of the prosthetic knee employing the EMG-based volitional control and the intact knee of the three subjects were 6.2\u00b0 and 5.2\u00b0, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2010.2070840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5672100/05559403.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5672100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2010.2070840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Volitional Control of a Prosthetic Knee Using Surface Electromyography","volume":"58","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559403/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11698303","pubMedId":"20805047","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559403/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volitional Control of a Prosthetic Knee Using Surface Electromyography","sourcePdf":"tbme-ha-2070840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057348S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5672100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5672100","articleId":"5559403","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5559406,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This brief proposes a new robust Kalman filter-based subspace tracking algorithm to overcome these two limitations of the PAST algorithm. It is based on a new extension of the adaptive Kalman filter with variable number of measurements (KFVNM) for tracking fast-varying subspace. Furthermore, M-estimation is incorporated into this KFVNM algorithm to combat the adverse effects of impulsive noise. Simulation results show that the robust KFVNM-based subspace tracking algorithm has a better performance than the PAST algorithm for tracking fast-varying subspace and in an impulsive noise environment.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2010.2056414","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5571850/05559406.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2056414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","startPage":"740","endPage":"744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Robust Kalman Filter-Based Subspace Tracking Algorithm in an Impulsive Noise Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559406","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"A New Robust Kalman Filter-Based Subspace Tracking Algorithm in an Impulsive Noise Environment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559406/","volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5559406/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523343","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Robust Kalman Filter-Based Subspace Tracking Algorithm in an Impulsive Noise Environment","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chan-2056414-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056987S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5571850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5571850","articleId":"5559406","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5559407,"authors":[{"name":"Pui Ying Or","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Pui Ying","lastName":"Or","id":"37411036200"},{"name":"Ka Nang Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ka Nang","lastName":"Leung","id":"37269821400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5559407","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3171},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Capacitors","Transient analysis","Transient response","Impedance","Time factors","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast-transient low-dropout regulator","load-tracking impedance adjustment","loop-gain boosting technique","low-equivalent-series-resistance","nanorange output capacitor","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-dropout (LDO) regulator","low-equivalent-series-resistance (ESR) capacitor"]}],"abstract":"A low-voltage fast-transient low dropout (LDO) regulator compensated by an off-chip, low-equivalent-series-resistance (ESR), nanorange output capacitor is reported in this brief.

These situations are referred to as one-class classification. Traditional supervised learning is inefficient for one-class classification because it requires all classes that occur in the image to be exhaustively assigned labels. In this paper, we investigate a new positive and unlabeled learning (PUL) algorithm, applying it to one-class classifications of two scenes of a high-spatial-resolution aerial photograph. The PUL algorithm trains a classifier on positive and unlabeled data, estimates the probability that a positive training sample has been labeled, and generates binary predictions for test samples using an adjusted threshold. Experimental results indicate that the new algorithm provides high classification accuracy, outperforming the biased support-vector machine (SVM), one-class SVM, and Gaussian domain descriptor methods. The advantages of the new algorithm are that it can use unlabeled data to help build classifiers, and it requires only a small set of positive data to be labeled by hand. Therefore, it can significantly reduce the effort of assigning labels to training data without losing predictive accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Positive and Unlabeled Learning Algorithm for One-Class Classification of Remote-Sensing Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2058578","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5695081/05559411.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2058578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5695081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559411/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Positive and Unlabeled Learning Algorithm for One-Class Classification of Remote-Sensing Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5559411/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11769606","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Positive and Unlabeled Learning Algorithm for One-Class Classification of Remote-Sensing Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-guo-2058578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142126S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5695081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5695081","articleId":"5559411","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559416,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Barcaro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/5639224/5559416/5559416-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Massimo Barcaro (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

Since custom solutions are expensive, machines with dual three-phase windings supplied by two parallel converters seem to be more convenient. In the event of a fault, one of the two three-phase windings (the faulty winding) is disconnected, and the motor is operated by means of the healthy winding only. A fractional-slot permanent-magnet (PM) motor with 12 slots and 10 poles is considered with two different rotor topologies: the interior PM (IPM) rotor and the surface-mounted PM rotor. Various winding configurations of dual three-phase windings are taken into account, comparing average torque, torque ripple, mutual coupling among phases, overload capability, and short-circuit behavior. Considerations are given regarding the winding arrangements so as to avoid excessive torque ripple and unbalanced radial forces in faulty operating conditions.

Application of a real-time LMT to a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) is examined. Simulation and experimental results verify the characteristics of each category of real-time LMTs. Sensitivity of real-time LMTs to motor parameters is discussed.

Extensive simulations and experimentations confirm the validity of the proposed scheme for all kinds of load (balanced and unbalanced) for a three-phase three-wire system.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2070770","startPage":"421","endPage":"428","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5684364/05559425.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2070770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5684364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Shunt Active Power Filter With Enhanced Performance Using ANN-Based Predictive and Adaptive Controllers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Active filters","Harmonic analysis","Power harmonic filters","Equations","Voltage control","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","adaptive control","harmonic distortion","neurocontrollers","power filters","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ANN-based predictive controllers","adaptive controllers","shunt-type active power filter","artificial neural networks","fast estimation","current compensation","dc-link voltage dynamic","adaptive ANN based network","total harmonic distortion","three phase three wire system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaline","current control","nonlinear load","shunt active power filter (APF)","total harmonic distortion (THD)","voltage source inverter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559425/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Shunt Active Power Filter With Enhanced Performance Using ANN-Based Predictive and Adaptive Controllers","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5559425/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742164","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Shunt Active Power Filter With Enhanced Performance Using ANN-Based Predictive and Adaptive Controllers","sourcePdf":"tie-bhattacharya-2070770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05907S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5684364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"219","xplore-issue":"5684364","articleId":"5559425","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":5559426,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto C\u00e1rdenas","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Santiago de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5727983/5559426/5559426-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roberto C\u00e1rdenas (S'95\u2013M'97\u2013SM'07) was born in Punta Arenas, Chile.

Matrix converters (MCs) are a good alternative to back-to-back converters because they have several advantages in terms of size and weight. Therefore, MCs can be advantageously used in any variable-speed generation system where high efficiency, reliability, small size, and low weight are considered important factors. Nevertheless, to interface an MC-based generation system to an unbalanced 3\u03c6 stand-alone load, a four-leg MC is required to provide a path for the zero-sequence load current. Space-vector-modulation (SVM) algorithms for the operation of four-leg MCs have been proposed in the literature. However, these modulation methods have high computational burdens, and they are difficult to implement, even in fast DSP-based control platforms. Therefore, only simulation results have been reported in these publications. In this paper, an SVM algorithm is optimized and experimentally tested. Moreover, the harmonics produced in the input current when a four-leg MC is feeding an unbalanced or nonlinear load are also mathematically analyzed in this paper, with experimental verification being provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","volume":"58","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11862396","publicationDate":"April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559426/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Validation of a Space-Vector-Modulation Algorithm for Four-Leg Matrix Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Validation of a Space-Vector-Modulation Algorithm for Four-Leg Matrix Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-cardenas-2068531-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087691S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5727983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5727983","articleId":"5559426","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559427,"authors":[{"name":"Drazen Dujic","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research Center, Baden-Dattwil, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5873561/5559427/5559427-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Drazen Dujic (S'03\u2013M'09) received the Dipl.

Various pulsewidth modulation (PWM) methods for multiphase VSIs, aimed at sinusoidal output voltage generation, have been developed using both carrier-based and space-vector approaches. An increased number of voltage space vectors, available for the synthesis of the output voltage, offer greater flexibility for the PWM scheme development, compared to the three-phase case. This paper presents comprehensive analytical analysis and comparison of switching ripple characteristics of two continuous space vector PWM (SVPWM) methods for a five-phase two-level VSI. Considered SVPWM schemes select a different set of four active space vectors per switching period in order to generate sinusoidal output voltages. This paper also presents the evaluation of the flux harmonic distortion factors of the SVPWM techniques. Correlation with corresponding current ripple and total harmonic distortion is established in Part 2 of this paper, where theoretical considerations are verified by simulations and through experimental investigation on a five-phase VSI-fed induction motor drive.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5873561/05559427.pdf","startPage":"2789","endPage":"2798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2070777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2070777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching Ripple Characteristics of Space Vector PWM Schemes for Five-Phase Two-Level Voltage Source Inverters\u2014Part 1: Flux Harmonic Distortion Factors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Switches","Harmonic analysis","Trajectory","Support vector machine classification","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching ripple characteristics","space vector PWM schemes","five-phase two-level voltage source inverters","flux harmonic distortion factors","pulsewidth modulation methods","carrier-based approaches","current ripple","total harmonic distortion","THD","five-phase VSI-fed induction motor drive","multiphase variable-speed drives"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flux harmonic distortion factor (HDF)","multiphase drives","space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM)","voltage source inverters (VSIs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Switching Ripple Characteristics of Space Vector PWM Schemes for Five-Phase Two-Level Voltage Source Inverters\u2014Part 1: Flux Harmonic Distortion Factors","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5559427/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049285","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching Ripple Characteristics of Space Vector PWM Schemes for Five-Phase Two-Level Voltage Source Inverters\u2014Part 1: Flux Harmonic Distortion Factors","sourcePdf":"tie-levi-2070777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075747S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5559427","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559429,"authors":[{"name":"HongBo Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5765746/5559429/5559429-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["HongBo Li received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University.

Among all the MPPT strategies, the incremental-conductance (INC) algorithm is widely employed due to easy implementation and high tracking accuracy. In this paper, a novel variable step-size incremental-resistance MPPT algorithm is introduced, which not only has the merits of INC but also automatically adjusts the step size to track the PV array MPP. Compared with the variable step-size INC method, the proposed scheme can greatly improve the MPPT response speed and accuracy at steady state simultaneously. Moreover, it is more suitable for practical operating conditions due to a wider operating range. This paper provides the theoretical analysis and the design principle of the proposed MPPT strategy. Simulation and experimental results verify its feasibility.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5765746/05559432.pdf","startPage":"2427","endPage":"2434","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2064275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2064275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5765746","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Improved Variable Step-Size Incremental-Resistance MPPT Method for PV Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Power generation","Radiation effects","Steady-state","Resistance","Accuracy","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric admittance","maximum power point trackers","photovoltaic power systems","solar cell arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved variable step size incremental resistance MPPT method","PV system","maximum power point tracking","photovoltaic power system","PV array","solar irradiation","incremental conductance algorithm","INC","step size INC method","theoretical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Incremental resistance (INR)","maximum power point (MPP) tracking (MPPT)","photovoltaic (PV) power systems","variable step size"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Improved Variable Step-Size Incremental-Resistance MPPT Method for PV Systems","volume":"58","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5559432/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11988585","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Improved Variable Step-Size Incremental-Resistance MPPT Method for PV Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-mei-2064275-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070257S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5765746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"429","xplore-issue":"5765746","articleId":"5559432","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5559433,"authors":[{"name":"Tsarafidy Raminosoa","affiliation":["Power Electronics Machines and Control Research Group, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5873561/5559433/5559433-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsarafidy Raminosoa (M'10) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Polytechnic Institute of Lorraine, Nancy, France, in 2006.","From 2006 to 2008, he was a Research Assistant with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Control Systems, University of Technology of Belfort\u2013Montbeliard, Belfort, France.

Machine selection and design for fault tolerance has to be considered at an early stage to ensure optimal performance at a system level. This paper looks at the fault-tolerant properties of permanent-magnet flux-switching machines (PMFSMs) and proposes a new configuration able to fulfill the fault-tolerant requirements. PMFSMs have the distinct property of having a robust rotor construction with the permanent magnets embedded in the stator while having their operational characteristics similar to those of synchronous permanent-magnet machines. While these machines have numerous inherent advantages for achieving a high power density, in their basic form, they are not tolerant to short-circuit winding failures. This paper will look at a novel stator structure able to achieve a 1-p.u. winding inductance and will subsequently look at design iterations to maximize the torque density.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5873561/05559433.pdf","startPage":"2818","endPage":"2825","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2070782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2070782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Considerations for a Fault-Tolerant Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Machine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Teeth","Inductance","Rotors","Magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","permanent magnet machines","reliability","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant flux-switching permanent-magnet machine","safety critical aerospace application","system reliability level","PMFSM","robust rotor construction","power density","short-circuit winding failure","torque density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design","fault tolerant","flux-switching machine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design Considerations for a Fault-Tolerant Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Machine","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5559433/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049288","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Considerations for a Fault-Tolerant Flux-Switching Permanent-Magnet Machine","sourcePdf":"tie-raminosoa-2070782-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151582S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5559433","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559434,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Ying Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6087309/5559434/5559434-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Ying Sun (M'95) was born in Hualien, Taiwan, in 1954.

For the proposed algorithm, in order to detect a time-variant mixing matrix, short-time Fourier transform is employed to segment received mixtures. Because is unknown, our algorithm use more estimates to find out the mixing vectors by particle swarm optimizer (PSO); and then, surplus estimates are removed by two proposed processes. However, the estimated accuracy of PSO will affect the correctness of extracting mixing vectors. Consequently, an improved PSO version called the cluster guide PSO (CGPSO) is further proposed according to the character of sparse representation. In simulations, several real assumptions that were less discussed before will be tested. Some representative BSS algorithms and PSO versions are compared with the CGPSO-based algorithm.

The algorithm implements two main steps: 1) semisupervised learning of the posterior class distributions followed by 2) segmentation, which infers an image of class labels from a posterior distribution built on the learned class distributions and on a Markov random field. The posterior class distributions are modeled using multinomial logistic regression, where the regressors are learned using both labeled and, through a graph-based technique, unlabeled samples. Such unlabeled samples are actively selected based on the entropy of the corresponding class label. The prior on the image of labels is a multilevel logistic model, which enforces segmentation results in which neighboring labels belong to the same class. The maximum a posteriori segmentation is computed by the \u03b1-expansion min-cut-based integer optimization algorithm. Our experimental results, conducted using synthetic and real hyperspectral image data sets collected by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer system of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Jet Propulsion Laboratory over the regions of Indian Pines, IN, and Salinas Valley, CA, reveal that the proposed approach can provide classification accuracies that are similar or higher than those achieved by other supervised methods for the considered scenes. Our results also indicate that the use of a spatial prior can greatly improve the final results with respect to a case in which only the learned class densities are considered, confirming the importance of jointly considering spatial and spectral information in hyperspectral image segmentation.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2060550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5607221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2060550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5607221/05559437.pdf","startPage":"4085","endPage":"4098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semisupervised Hyperspectral Image Segmentation Using Multinomial Logistic Regression With Active Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Semisupervised Hyperspectral Image Segmentation Using Multinomial Logistic Regression With Active Learning","volume":"48","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559437/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11597046","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559437/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semisupervised Hyperspectral Image Segmentation Using Multinomial Logistic Regression With Active Learning","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bioucasdias-2060550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135038S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5607221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"249","xplore-issue":"5607221","articleId":"5559437","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5559441,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Belega","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Politehnica University of Timi\u015foara, Timisoara, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5599382/5559441/5559441-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Belega received the engineer degree in electronics and telecommunications, the M.S. degree in electrical measurement, and the Ph.D. degree in electronics from the \u201cPolitehnica\u201d University of Timi\u015foara, Timi\u015foara, Romania, in 1994, 1995, and 2001, respectively.","In 1995, he joined the Measurements and Optical Electronics Department, \u201cPolitehnica\u201d University of Timi\u015foara, where he is currently an Associate Professor.

The Taylor-Fourier estimator can be seen as a bank of maximally flat finite-impulse-response filters, with the frequency response of ideal differentiators about each harmonic frequency.

This results in an increased weight of the drilling assembly, higher cost due to the use of nonmagnetic drill collars necessary for shielding the magnetometers, and significant errors in the position of the drilling bit. A novel inertial navigation system (INS)-based technique has been previously proposed as an alternative to magnetometer-based downhole surveying. Previous studies have shown theoretically that an adaptive-filter-based in-drilling alignment (IDA) fine alignment method successfully limits the error growth associated with INS. This study aims at examining IDA's practical feasibility and, specifically, its ability to estimate the azimuth angle. Experimental testing of the IDA method was conducted under laboratory conditions with an apparatus that can easily be adopted for downhole conditions.

The \u201cthree-stage\u201d Doherty PA is the most efficient architecture among the various Doherty PAs for achieving a high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) signal. However, it has a problem in that the carrier PA has to maintain a saturated state with constant output power when the other peaking PAs are turned on. We solved the problem using a gate envelope tracking (ET) technique. For the proper load modulation, the gate biases of the peaking PAs were adaptively controlled, and the peak power and maximum efficiency characteristics along the backed-off output power region were successfully achieved. Using Agilent's Advanced Design System and Matlab simulations, the overall behavior of the three-stage Doherty PA with the ET technique employed was fully analyzed, and the optimum design procedure is suggested. For the WiMAX signal with a 7.8-dB PAPR, the measured drain efficiency of the proposed three-stage Doherty PA is 55.4% at an average output power of 42.54 dBm, which is an 8-dB backed-off output power. Digital predistortion was used to linearize the proposed PA. After linearization, a -33.15 dB relative constellation error performance was achieved, satisfying the system specifications. This is the best performance of any 2.655-GHz WiMAX application ever reported, and it clearly shows that the proposed three-stage Doherty PA is suitable as a highly efficient and linear transmitter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5599391/05559455.pdf","startPage":"2562","endPage":"2574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2063831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2063831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5599391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Design of a Highly Efficient Three-Stage Doherty PA Using Gate Adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Logic gates","Modulation","Peak to average power ratio","HEMTs","WiMAX","Gallium nitride"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","power amplifiers","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate adaptation","three-stage Doherty power amplifier","802.16e mobile world interoperability","microwave access","WiMAX application","saturated state","gate envelope tracking technique","load modulation","gate bias","Agilent's Advanced Design System","Matlab simulations","WiMAX signal","digital predistortion","system specifications","linear transmitter","frequency 2.655 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Efficiency","envelope tracking (ET)","GaN","HEMT","linearity","peak to average power ratio (PAPR)","power amplifier (PA)","RF transmitter","three-stage Doherty PA","world interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Design of a Highly Efficient Three-Stage Doherty PA Using Gate Adaptation","volume":"58","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5559455/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11575374","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Design of a Highly Efficient Three-Stage Doherty PA Using Gate Adaptation","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kim-2063831-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069866S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5599391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5599391","articleId":"5559455","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559470,"authors":[{"name":"Thilo Sauter","affiliation":["Austrian Academy of Sciences, Wien, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5727983/5559470/5559470-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thilo Sauter (M'93\u2013SM'09) received the Dipl.\u2013Ing. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria, in 1992 and 1999, respectively.","From 1992 to 1996, he was a Research Assistant at the Institute of General Electrical Engineering, working in the area of programmable logic and analog application-specific integrated circuit design.

However, because of the complex characteristics of imbalanced data, many real-world solutions struggle to provide robust efficiency in learning-based applications. In an effort to address this problem, this paper presents Ranked Minority Oversampling in Boosting (RAMOBoost), which is a RAMO technique based on the idea of adaptive synthetic data generation in an ensemble learning system. Briefly, RAMOBoost adaptively ranks minority class instances at each learning iteration according to a sampling probability distribution that is based on the underlying data distribution, and can adaptively shift the decision boundary toward difficult-to-learn minority and majority class instances by using a hypothesis assessment procedure. Simulation analysis on 19 real-world datasets assessed over various metrics-including overall accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, G-mean, and receiver operation characteristic analysis-is used to illustrate the effectiveness of this method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559472/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11561194","pubMedId":"20805051","volume":"21","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RAMOBoost: Ranked Minority Oversampling in Boosting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RAMOBoost: Ranked Minority Oversampling in Boosting","sourcePdf":"tnn-he-2066988-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.286577S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5594730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5594730","articleId":"5559472","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":5559473,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Zhang","affiliation":["Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5594730/5559473/5559473-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Zhang received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China, in 2008.","He is now with the Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA.

However, the cost of storing and manipulating the complete kernel matrix makes it infeasible for large problems. The Nystr\u00f6m method is a popular sampling-based low-rank approximation scheme for reducing the computational burdens in handling large kernel matrices. In this paper, we analyze how the approximating quality of the Nystr\u00f6m method depends on the choice of landmark points, and in particular the encoding powers of the landmark points in summarizing the data. Our (non-probabilistic) error analysis justifies a \u201cclustered Nystr\u00f6m method\u201d that uses the k-means clustering centers as landmark points. Our algorithm can be applied to scale up a wide variety of algorithms that depend on the eigenvalue decomposition of kernel matrix (or its variant), such as kernel principal component analysis, Laplacian eigenmap, spectral clustering, as well as those involving kernel matrix inverse such as least-squares support vector machine and Gaussian process regression. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of our algorithm in both accuracy and efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Matrix decomposition","Approximation error","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Approximation algorithms","Manifolds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","error analysis","Gaussian processes","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","pattern clustering","principal component analysis","regression analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clustered Nystr\u00f6m method","large scale manifold learning","dimension reduction","kernel matrix","machine learning algorithms","kernel methods","sampling-based low-rank approximation scheme","error analysis","k-means clustering centers","kernel principal component analysis","Laplacian eigenmap","spectral clustering","least-squares support vector machine","Gaussian process regression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dimension reduction","eigenvalue decomposition","kernel matrix","low-rank approximation","manifold learning","Nystr\u00f6m method","sampling"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Cluster Analysis","Least-Squares Analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2064786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5594730/05559473.pdf","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2064786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustered Nystr\u00f6m Method for Large Scale Manifold Learning and Dimension Reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clustered Nystr\u00f6m Method for Large Scale Manifold Learning and Dimension Reduction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559473/","volume":"21","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559473/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11561193","pubMedId":"20805054","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustered Nystr\u00f6m Method for Large Scale Manifold Learning and Dimension Reduction","sourcePdf":"tnn-kwok-2064786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104836S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5594730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5594730","articleId":"5559473","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":5559474,"authors":[{"name":"Xinsong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Honghe University, Mengzi, Yunnan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5594730/5559474/5559474-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinsong Yang received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Huaihua Normal University, Hunan, China, in 1992, and the M.S. degree in mathematics from Yunnan University, Kunming, China, in 2006.","He was a Visiting Scholar in the Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, from 2008 to 2009.

Our synchronization criteria are easily verified and do not need to solve any linear matrix inequality. Some existing results are improved and extended.

The ability to detect falls events in an unsupervised manner would lead to improved prognoses for falls victims. Several wearable accelerometry and gyroscope-based falls detection devices have been described in the literature; however, they all suffer from unacceptable false positive rates. This paper investigates the augmentation of such systems with a barometric pressure sensor, as a surrogate measure of altitude, to assist in discriminating real fall events from normal activities of daily living. The acceleration and air pressure data are recorded using a wearable device attached to the subject's waist and analyzed offline. The study incorporates several protocols including simulated falls onto a mattress and simulated activities of daily living, in a cohort of 20 young healthy volunteers (12 male and 8 female; age: 23.7 \u00b13.0 years). A heuristically trained decision tree classifier is used to label suspected falls. The proposed system demonstrated considerable improvements in comparison to an existing accelerometry-based technique; showing an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 96.9%, 97.5%, and 96.5%, respectively, in the indoor environment, with no false positives generated during extended testing during activities of daily living. This is compared to 85.3%, 75%, and 91.5% for the same measures, respectively, when using accelerometry alone. The increased specificity of this system may enhance the usage of falls detectors among the elderly population.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2070807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/5658599/05559476.pdf","startPage":"619","endPage":"627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2070807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5658599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Barometric Pressure and Triaxial Accelerometry-Based Falls Event Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"Barometric Pressure and Triaxial Accelerometry-Based Falls Event Detection","volume":"18","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11692542","pubMedId":"20805056","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559476/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559476/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Barometric Pressure and Triaxial Accelerometry-Based Falls Event Detection","sourcePdf":"tnsre-lovell-2070807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088253S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"5658599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"197","xplore-issue":"5658599","articleId":"5559476","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5559477,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan Nghia Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Sydney University of Technology, Broadway, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/5710486/5559477/5559477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tuan Nghia Nguyen received the B.S. degree from Hanoi University of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam and the Ph.D. degree from the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Sydney, Australia, in 2010.","His main research interests include biomedical system modeling and control, robust and adaptive control, multivariable control, neural network and intelligent systems, and embedded system design.","Dr. Nguyen received the University Merit Award from Hanoi University of Technology, in 2003."]},"firstName":"Tuan Nghia","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38607134400"},{"name":"Steven W.

The performance of the differential-mode (DM) filter stage can usually be well predicted, but the common mode (CM) behavior is more difficult to handle. This is especially true for three-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) rectifier systems, which inherently show a large high-frequency CM voltage at the rectifier output. Possible CM noise current paths of a three-phase/level PWM rectifier are analyzed in this paper where parasitic capacitances to the heat sink and to earth are considered. In addition, a concept to significantly reduce CM emissions is discussed in detail. Based on the proposed models, an EMI filter design for a system with 1 MHz switching frequency is shown. Experimental verification of the designed EMI filter is presented by impedance and conducted emission (CE) measurements taken from a 10 kW prototype. Several practical aspects of filter implementation such as component arrangement, shielding layers, magnetic coupling, etc., are discussed and verified by measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5871429/05559481.pdf","startPage":"1192","endPage":"1204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2070520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2070520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5871429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMI Filter Design for a 1 MHz, 10 kW Three-Phase/Level PWM Rectifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Delta modulation","Heat sinks","Earth","Capacitance","Electromagnetic interference","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic interference","heat sinks","power filters","PWM rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM rectifier","attenuation characteristics","EMI filter","electromagnetic interference filters","differential-mode filter stage","common mode behavior","three phase pulsewidth modulation","noise current paths","parasitic capacitances","heat sink","switching frequency","frequency 1 MHz","power 10 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Common mode (CM) noise","electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) filters","power-factor correction (PFC)","three-phase ac\u2013dc power conversion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","displayDocTitle":"EMI Filter Design for a 1 MHz, 10 kW Three-Phase/Level PWM Rectifier","volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5559481/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12047674","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMI Filter Design for a 1 MHz, 10 kW Three-Phase/Level PWM Rectifier","sourcePdf":"tpel-hartmann-2070520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075408S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5871429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5871429","articleId":"5559481","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5559482,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Yasser Abdel-Rady Ibrahim Mohamed (M'06) was born in Cairo, Egypt, on November 25, 1977.

The proposed scheme relies on a high-bandwidth current-control loop, which is designed with continuous wideband active damping against converter-grid disturbances and parametric uncertainties by providing adaptive internal-model dynamics. First, a predictive current controller with time-delay compensation is adopted to control the grid-side current with high-bandwidth characteristics to facilitate higher bandwidth disturbance rejection and active-damping control at higher frequencies. Second, to ensure high disturbance rejection of grid distortion, converter resonance at parameter variation, and parametric instabilities, an adaptive internal model for the capacitor voltage and grid-side current dynamics is included within the current-feedback structure. Due to the time-varying and periodic nature of the internal-model dynamics, a neural-network-based estimator is proposed to construct the internal-model dynamics in real time. Theoretical analysis and comparative experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2070878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5767815/05559482.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2070878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of Converter-Grid Resonance, Grid-Induced Distortion, and Parametric Instabilities in Converter-Based Distributed Generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559482/","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of Converter-Grid Resonance, Grid-Induced Distortion, and Parametric Instabilities in Converter-Based Distributed Generation","volume":"26","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12046130","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559482/","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of Converter-Grid Resonance, Grid-Induced Distortion, and Parametric Instabilities in Converter-Based Distributed Generation","sourcePdf":"tpel-ibrahim-2070878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065746S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5767815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5767815","articleId":"5559482","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559492,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/5596171/5559492/5559492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xing Wei (S'10) received the B.Eng. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Utah State University, Logan.

The input into the model is a driving voltage derived from solar wind parameters and the interplanetary magnetic field measured by the Advanced Composition Explorer satellite. The output is a field-aligned current proportional to the westward auroral electrojet AL index and the energy stored in the Earth's ring current which is proportional to the Dst index. In order to use the model for the real-time prediction of geomagnetic activity, the model parameters are required to update periodically. We developed a modified genetic algorithm (GA) with micromovement (MGAM) to train the parameters of the model in order to achieve the lowest mse against the measured AL and Dst indexes. The MGAM implements a particle-swarm-optimization-inspired movement phase that helps to improve the convergence rate while employing the efficient GA mechanism for maintaining the population diversity. The performance of the MGAM is compared to a basic real-valued GA (RGA) on five standard test functions and historical geomagnetic storm data sets. While the MGAM performs substantially better than the RGA when evaluating the standard test functions, the improvement is about 6%-12% when used on the 20-D nonlinear dynamical WINDMI model.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2010.2061867","startPage":"2922","endPage":"2933","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2010.2061867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5596171","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/5596171/05559492.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of a Magnetosphere Model for Real-Time Space Weather Prediction Using a Modified Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559492/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of a Magnetosphere Model for Real-Time Space Weather Prediction Using a Modified Genetic Algorithm","volume":"38","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5559492/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11574202","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of a Magnetosphere Model for Real-Time Space Weather Prediction Using a Modified Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tps-wei-2061867-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077969S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"5596171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5596171","articleId":"5559492","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559499,"authors":[{"name":"Jaesin Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaesin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37539880900"},{"name":"Seok-Hwan Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seok-Hwan","lastName":"Park","id":"37293216300"},{"name":"Hakjea Sung","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea","School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hakjea","lastName":"Sung","id":"37401220500"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279664500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5559499","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we provide an expression of spatial multiplexing gain (SMG) for two mutually interfering multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels, referred to as MIMO-IBC, with linear transceiver.

A small antenna aperture leads to interference from neighboring satellites utilizing the same frequency bands.

An iterative least squares technique is adopted combining spatial and temporal processing and achieving robustness against pointing errors. Simulation results show how the proposed joint spatial and temporal adapted mechanism outperforms the simple combination of existing techniques under interference overloaded conditions.

Many PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed in the literature, among which, partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique has been taken considerable investigation. However, PTS technique requires an exhaustive search over all combinations of allowed phase factors, whose complexity increases exponentially with the number of sub-blocks. In this paper, a newly suboptimal method based on modified artificial bee colony (ABC-PTS) algorithm is proposed to search the better combination of phase factors. The ABC-PTS algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity for larger PTS subblocks and offers lower PAPR at the same time. Simulation results show that the ABC-PTS algorithm is an efficient method to achieve significant PAPR reduction.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.081610.100047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05559502.pdf","startPage":"2994","endPage":"2999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.081610.100047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PAPR Reduction Method Based on Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for OFDM Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559502/","displayDocTitle":"A PAPR Reduction Method Based on Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for OFDM Signals","volume":"9","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2010","accessionNumber":"11574430","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559502/","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PAPR Reduction Method Based on Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm for OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"2994-tw1010-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07322S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5559502","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5559503,"authors":[{"name":"Liangzhong Ruan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5595095/5559503/5559503-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liangzhong Ruan received the B.

The transmit power as well as the hop selection of the cognitive relays can be dynamically adapted according to the local (and causal) knowledge of the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) in the multi-hop SU system. We shall determine a low complexity, decentralized algorithm to maximize the average end-to-end throughput of the SU system with dynamic spatial reuse. The problem is challenging due to the decentralized requirement as well as the causality constraint on the knowledge of CSI. Furthermore, the problem belongs to the class of stochastic Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problems which is quite challenging. We exploit the time-scale difference between the PU activity and the CSI fluctuations and decompose the problem into a master problem and subproblems. We derive an asymptotically optimal low complexity solution using divide-and-conquer and illustrate that significant performance gain can be obtained through dynamic hop selection and power control.

Given a set of examples, we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform the above estimation task. Different from other learning methods, the CNNs learn both spatial and temporal features jointly from image pairs of two adjacent frames. We introduce multiple path ways in CNN to better fuse local and global information. A creative shift-variant CNN architecture is designed so as to alleviate the drift problem when the distracting objects are similar to the target in cluttered environment.

Matching the DF-transceiver design parameters to the channel characteristics can improve system performance, but requires channel knowledge. We consider the fast-fading channel scenario, with a receiver capable of tracking the channel-state variations accurately, while the transmitter only has long-term, channel-distribution information. The receiver design problem given channel-state information is well studied in the literature. We focus on transmitter optimization, which amounts to designing a statistical precoder to assist the channel-tailored DF equalizer. We develop a design framework that encompasses a wide range of performance metrics. Common cost functions for precoder optimization are analyzed, thereby identifying a structure of typical cost functions. Transmitter design is approached for typical cost functions in general, and we derive a precoder design formulation as a convex optimization problem. Two important subclasses of cost functions are considered in more detail. First, we explore a symmetry of DF transceivers with a uniform subchannel rate allocation, and derive a simplified convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved even as system dimensions grow. Second, we explore the tractability of a certain class of mean square error based cost functions, and solve the transmitter design problem with a simple algorithm that identifies the convex hull of a set of points in R\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

However, the indoor system will likely be in dense environments, in which many cells exist in a small region, and a great portion of the coverage of a cell is overlapped by that of other cells. In dense environments, the systems are exposed to strong intercell interference, which is critical to system performance and should be mitigated by a novel radio resource management (RRM) scheme. In this paper, we first derive the characteristics of an optimal allocation of power and subchannel in dense environments. We prove that a special form of power allocation, which is called binary power allocation, in which only one transmitter transmits a signal for each subchannel, performs better than power allocation by conventional schemes. Then, we propose an efficient scheme for jointly allocating power and a subchannel based on the binary power allocation. Simulation and numerical results show that the proposed scheme can achieve larger system capacity than conventional schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Joint Power and Subchannel Allocation Scheme Maximizing System Capacity in Indoor Dense Mobile Communication Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2070816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5613993/05559511.pdf","startPage":"4340","endPage":"4353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2070816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Joint Power and Subchannel Allocation Scheme Maximizing System Capacity in Indoor Dense Mobile Communication Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5559511/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630032","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Joint Power and Subchannel Allocation Scheme Maximizing System Capacity in Indoor Dense Mobile Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-kim-2070816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06745S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5613993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5613993","articleId":"5559511","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559512,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5613993/5559512/5559512-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Li (S'08) received the B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2007.

Efficient algorithms and policies for opportunistic forwarding are crucial for maximizing the message delivery probability while reducing the delivery cost. In this paper, we investigate the problem of energy-efficient opportunistic forwarding for DTNs. First, we model the message dissemination by introducing a continuous-time Markov framework. Based on this framework, we formulate the optimization problem of opportunistic forwarding, with the constraint of energy consumed by the message delivery for both two-hop and epidemic forwarding. Then, based on the solution of the optimization problem, we design different kinds of forwarding policies such as static and dynamic policies. Among these policies, we find that the threshold dynamic policy is optimal for both two-hop and epidemic forwarding. By simulation results, we show the accuracy of our continuous-time Markov analysis model. Furthermore, through extensive numerical results, we demonstrate that the performance of the threshold dynamic policy is the best among the static and continuous dynamic policies, and among the continuous dynamic policies, the negative-power policy provides relatively better performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Optimal Opportunistic Forwarding for Delay-Tolerant Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2070521","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5613993/05559512.pdf","startPage":"4500","endPage":"4512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2070521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Optimal Opportunistic Forwarding for Delay-Tolerant Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5559512/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630030","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Optimal Opportunistic Forwarding for Delay-Tolerant Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2070521-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134143S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5613993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5613993","articleId":"5559512","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5559513,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghui Li","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence in Telecommunications, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5613993/5559513/5559513-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yonghui Li (M'04\u2013SM'09) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China, in November 2002.","From 1999 to 2003, he was a Project Manager with Linkair Communication, where he was responsible for the design of physical-layer solutions for the Large Area Synchronized code-division multiple-access system.

Recent mechanics-based models of these \u201cactive cannulas\u201d are able to accurately describe the curve of the robot in free space, given the preformed tube curves and the linear and angular positions of the tube bases. However, in practical applications, where the active cannula must interact with its environment or apply controlled forces, a model that accounts for deformation under external loading is required. In this paper, we apply geometrically exact rod theory to produce a forward kinematic model that accurately describes large deflections due to a general collection of externally applied point and/or distributed wrench loads.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of carrier frequency offset (CFO) on SC-IFDMA and propose a new low-complexity time domain linear CFO compensation (TD-LCC) scheme. The TD-LCC scheme can be combined with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to further improve the system performance. The combined method will be referred to as TD-CC-SIC. We shall study the use of user equipment (UE) ordering algorithms in our TD-CC-SIC scheme and propose both optimal and suboptimal ordering algorithms in the MMSE sense. We also analyze both the output SINR and the BER performance of the proposed TD-LCC and TD-CC-SIC schemes. Simulation results along with theoretical SINR and BER results will show that the proposed TD-LCC and TD-CC-SIC schemes greatly reduce the CFO effect on SC-IFDMA. We also propose a new blind CFO estimation scheme for SC-IFDMA systems when the numbers of subcarrier sets allocated to different UEs are not the same due to their traffic requirements. Compared to the conventional blind CFO estimation schemes, it is shown that by using a virtual UE concept, the proposed scheme does not have the CFO ambiguity problem, and in some cases can improve the throughput efficiency since it does not need to increase the length of cyclic prefix (CP).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Estimation","Time domain analysis","Frequency domain analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Sparse matrices","Decorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","error statistics","estimation theory","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SC-IFDMA systems","single carrier interleaved frequency division multiple access","uplink multiuser access","next generation mobile systems","peak-to-average transmit power ratio","PAPR","carrier frequency offset","low-complexity time domain linear CFO compensation scheme","TD-LCC scheme","successive interference cancellation","system performance","TD-CC-SIC","user equipment ordering algorithms","suboptimal ordering algorithms","MMSE sense","BER performance","blind CFO estimation scheme","traffic requirements","CFO ambiguity","cyclic prefix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single carrier interleaved frequency division multiple access","CFO compensation","successive interference cancellation","CFO estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.081810.091622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5595095/05559663.pdf","startPage":"3200","endPage":"3213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5595095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.081810.091622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CFO Estimation and Compensation in SC-IFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CFO Estimation and Compensation in SC-IFDMA Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559663/","volume":"9","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559663/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11574427","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 August 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CFO Estimation and Compensation in SC-IFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"3200-tw1010-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067728S","chronDate":"October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5595095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5595095","articleId":"5559663","onlineDate":"30 August 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5559665,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Tingting","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Tingting","id":"37547412500"},{"name":"Sun Bin","affiliation":["Beijing Liujie Technology Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Bin","id":"37528420500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7681-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7679-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5559665","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559665","abstract":"Along with the developments of the high-speed railway, higher and higher technical requirements for the high-speed railway mobile communication system are raised.

The problem of solving matrix or vector equations is widely encountered in many different science and engineering fields, as it is usually an essential part in many solutions and applications. Recent research has been directed towards the online solution of algebraic equations, which especially includes matrix inversion and linear equation solving. A new recurrent neural network (RNN) is presented for solving online linear time-invariant (LTI) equations, which has been developed based ingeniously on a vector-valued error-function rather than a scalar-valued norm-based function. Theoretical analysis and simulation results both substantiate the efficacy of such an RNN model for online LTI equation solving.","doi":"10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559717","startPage":"V2-70","endPage":"V2-72","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550964/5559700/05559717.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent neural network for solving linear matrix equation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Recurrent neural networks","Equations","Vectors","Convergence","Artificial neural networks","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear matrix inequalities","matrix inversion","recurrent neural nets","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","linear matrix equation","algebraic equation","matrix inversion","online linear time invariant equation","vector valued error function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent Neural Network","Matrix Equations","Linear Output Regulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent neural network for solving linear matrix equation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5559717/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11520065","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent neural network for solving linear matrix equation","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"017V2E286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042067S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550964","isNumber":"5559700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550964","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5559700","articleId":"5559717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5559727,"authors":[{"name":"Kishor Sarawadekar","affiliation":["Department of E & ECE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Kishor","lastName":"Sarawadekar","id":"37395229700"},{"name":"Swapna Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of E & ECE, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Swapna","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37276973900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7681-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7679-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5559727","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Context","Encoding","Image coding","Clocks","Transform coding","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","codecs","data compression","field programmable gate arrays","image coding","integrated circuit design","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed VLSI design","EBCOT block coder","multimedia technology","highspeed real time image compression system","JPEG 2000 standard","bit plane coder","concurrent context modeling technique","ISO grayscale images","concurrent context coding architecture","Startix FPGA","HDTV encoding","frequency 164.47 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["JPEG 2000","Bit Plane Coder","EBCOT","VLSI Architecture"]}],"abstract":"With the growth in multimedia technology, demand for highspeed real time image compression system has also increased. JPEG 2000 standard is developed to cater such application requirements. However, the sequential execution of the bit plane coder (BPC) used in this standard consumes more clock cycles. To improve the performance of the BPC, a new concurrent context modeling technique is proposed in this paper. To study number of context generated in each clock cycle, analysis is carried out on five ISO grayscale images with size 512 \u00d7 512. The study revealed that about 58% of time more than 4 contexts are generated in one clock. Therefore, a new concurrent context coding architecture is proposed in this paper. It is implemented on Startix FPGA and the hardware requirement is reduced significantly, compared to similar architectures. Moreover, number of clock cycles required to encode a bit plane is reduced by 10% and it is minimum 2.5 times faster than the similar designs in existence. This design operates at 164.47 MHz, which makes it compatible for encoding HDTV 1920 \u00d7 1080 4:2:2 at 39 frames per second.","doi":"10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559727","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550964/5559700/05559727.pdf","startPage":"V2-110","endPage":"V2-113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area efficient, high-speed VLSI design for EBCOT block coder in JPEG 2000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559727/","displayDocTitle":"Area efficient, high-speed VLSI design for EBCOT block coder in JPEG 2000","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11520115","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5559727/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area efficient, high-speed VLSI design for EBCOT block coder in JPEG 2000","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"026V2E1303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057983S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550964","isNumber":"5559700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550964","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5559700","articleId":"5559727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5559731,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Jen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yao-Jen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37405385000"},{"name":"Chia-Lu Ho","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Lu","lastName":"Ho","id":"37292837700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7681-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7679-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5559731","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Arrays","Bit error rate","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas","Linear antenna arrays","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","electrical engineering computing","error statistics","fuzzy neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetric self-constructing fuzzy neural network beamformers","cluster-based minimum bit-error rate method","S-SCFNN beamformer training algorithm","array input signal space","rank-deficient multiantenna assisted system","adaptive beamformers","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCFNN","adaptive beamforming","nonlinear detection","MBER"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric self-constructing fuzzy neural network beamformers trained with cluster-based minimum bit-error rate method","doi":"10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559700","endPage":"V2-132","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550964/5559700/05559731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559731","startPage":"V2-128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559731","abstract":"In this paper, a powerful symmetric self-constructing fuzzy neural network (S-SCFNN) beamformer is proposed for multi-antenna assisted systems.

It can yield S-boxes with different input and output length. The designed n \u00d7 n S-boxes satisfy the desired cryptographic properties of non-linearity, completeness, strict avalanche, and output bits independence criteria. We propose a four layer topology, where the number of neurons, located at the input layer, is two times the number of input bits of the designed S-box and also, the number of neurons, located at the first hidden layer, is as equal as input layer neurons, while its second hidden layer included n/2 neurons, and its output layer included n neurons. The input value of the designed S-boxes consists of n-bit input vector and constant n-bit initial value (IV). We apply a Sigmoid nonlinear function as the activation function of our scheme. The values of weights were obtained through error back propagation learning algorithm, while a training set is used for learning. The used training set consists some different pairs of plaintexts and ciphertexts with AES's S-box. We also implement an 8 \u00d7 8 S-box based on neural networks with the essential security criteria. The results indicate that the proposed scheme can yield S-boxes with the desired cryptographic properties.","doi":"10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559741","startPage":"V2-172","endPage":"V2-178","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550964/5559700/05559741.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of S-boxes based on neural networks*","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Cryptography","Training","Neurons","Biological neural networks","Boolean functions","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","neural nets","nonlinear functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","s-boxes","cryptographic properties","Sigmoid nonlinear function","back propagation learning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block ciphers","S-box design","neural network","Cryptographic properties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of S-boxes based on neural networks*","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5559741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11520090","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of S-boxes based on neural networks*","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"040V2E1325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065208S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550964","isNumber":"5559700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550964","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5559700","articleId":"5559741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":5559743,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Jianhong","affiliation":["Jincheng College, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Jianhong","id":"37545282300"},{"name":"Parvinder S.

But, it is the severity of the faults that is more important than number of faults existing in the developed system as the major faults matters most for a developer and those major faults needs immediate attention. As, Neural networks, which have been already applied in software engineering applications to build reliability growth models predict the gross change or reusability metrics. Neural networks are non-linear sophisticated modeling techniques that are able to model complex functions. Neural network techniques are used when exact nature of input and outputs is not known. A key feature is that they learn the relationship between input and output through training. In this paper, five Neural Network Based techniques are explored and comparative analysis is performed for the modeling of severity of faults present in function based software systems. The NASA's public domain defect dataset is used for the modeling. The comparison of different algorithms is made on the basis of Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error and Accuracy Values. It is concluded that out of the five neural network based techniques Resilient Backpropagation algorithm based Neural Network is the best for modeling of the software components into different level of severity of the faults.

A 3D NoC with five layers is modeled based on modern 2D chips. We discuss the TSV number required for a 3D NoC. Different placements of half and quarter layer-layer connections are explored. We present benchmark results using a cycle accurate full system simulator based on realistic workloads. Experiments show that under different workloads, the average network latencies in full and half layer-layer connection are reduced by 5.24% and 2.18% respectively, compared with quarter design.

The accuracy of traffic identification methods has also become more important due to the greater use of delay sensitive applications such as VoIP and video over IP which need to be identified and given priority. Traditional techniques such as header and payload inspection are not providing sufficient information to identify traffic types due to the usage of non-standard ports, tunnelling and encryption. Promising methods have been proposed based around the statistical behaviour of traffic flow. Although these methods can achieve quite high accuracies in non-encrypted traffic flows, traffic identification of encrypted traffic flows is still in its early stages. In this paper, we will review the recent work done on encrypted traffic identification, particularly network layer encryption using statistical techniques and propose a remarkably simple technique for VoIP traffic identification in IPSec peer to peer tunnels. More importantly it is shown that VoIP/non-VoIP classification can be used to dramatically improve VoIP QoS and may be used to effectively block non-VoIP traffic in an IPSec tunnel. These results point to the usefulness of the technique and the desirability to find more discriminating VoIP identification algorithms for IPSec tunnels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5559900/","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11515337","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"VoIP traffic classification in IPSec tunnels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VoIP traffic classification in IPSec tunnels","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"035V1E085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040574S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550964","isNumber":"5559664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550964","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5559664","articleId":"5559900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5559902,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Hossein Kamali","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Hossein","lastName":"Kamali","id":"37542083000"},{"name":"Reza Shakerian","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Shakerian","id":"37542125200"},{"name":"Maysam Hedayati","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Maysam","lastName":"Hedayati","id":"37542084900"},{"name":"Mohsen Rahmani","affiliation":["Faculty of engineering, Arak University, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Rahmani","id":"37543585200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7681-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7679-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5559902","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2026},"abstract":"Security in transmission storage of digital images has its importance in today's image communications and confidential video conferencing. Due to the increasing use of images in industrial process, it is essential to protect the confidential image data from unauthorized access. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a well known block cipher that has several advantages in data encryption. However, it is not suitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we analyze and present a modification to the Advanced Encryption Standard (MAES) to reflect a high level security and better image encryption. The modification is done by adjusting the ShiftRow Transformation. Detailed results in terms of security analysis and implementation are given. Experimental results verify and prove that the proposed modification to image cryptosystem is highly secure from the cryptographic viewpoint. The results also prove that with a comparison to original AES encryption algorithm the modified algorithm gives better encryption results in terms of security against statistical attacks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550964/5559664/05559902.pdf","startPage":"V1-141","endPage":"V1-145","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559664","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new modified version of Advanced Encryption Standard based algorithm for image encryption","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Pixel","Entropy","Histograms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","image coding","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced encryption standard","image encryption algorithm","digital images transmission storage","image communication","video conferencing","industrial process","unauthorized access","data encryption","ShiftRow transformation","security analysis","image cryptosystem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)","MAES","Image Encryption","Security Analysis","ShiftRow Transformation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new modified version of Advanced Encryption Standard based algorithm for image encryption","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5559902/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11515339","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new modified version of Advanced Encryption Standard based algorithm for image encryption","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"033V1E075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044753S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550964","isNumber":"5559664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550964","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5559664","articleId":"5559902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5559903,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed M.

It is considered one of the vital concerns due to the continual blackouts in recent years which indicate that the power system today is too vulnerable to withstand a severer disturbance. The objective of this paper is to investigate and compare the performance of two vulnerability indices used for assessing the vulnerability of power systems when subjected to various contingencies. The Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) based on power system loss and possible loss of load will be used to speed up the assessment technique. In this study, contingency analyses were carried out on a practical 87 bus test system and the vulnerability indices were calculated using the MATLAB program. Results presented show that PSL index is more accurate for analyzing the impact of contingencies on a practical power system from the view point of power system loss considering the loss of power during contingencies.","doi":"10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559903","startPage":"V1-146","endPage":"V1-150","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559664","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Electronics and Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5550964/5559664/05559903.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic neural network for vulnerability prediction on a practical power system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5559903/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic neural network for vulnerability prediction on a practical power system","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5559903/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11515340","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"02 September 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic neural network for vulnerability prediction on a practical power system","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"034V1E076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061994S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5550964","isNumber":"5559664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5550964","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5559664","articleId":"5559903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5559909,"authors":[{"name":"I-Chyn Wey","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electrical Engineering, Electrical Engineering Department, and Green Technology, Research Center, Chang-Gung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Chyn","lastName":"Wey","id":"37267063900"},{"name":"Chun-Chien Wang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chang-Gung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Chien","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538400200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7681-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7679-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5559909","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error compensation","Microwave integrated circuits","Logic gates","Complexity theory","Hardware","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","error compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-error fixed-width multiplier","area-efficient fixed-width multiplier","error compensation circuit","dual group minor input correction vector","word length 16 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fixed-width multiplier","low-error","area-efficient","minor input correction vector"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5559909","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new error compensation circuit by using dual group minor input correction vector to lower compensation error.
