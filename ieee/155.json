A Gaussian noise is added to a microwave signal and they are applied at the input of several amplifying devices. Experimental data show a decrease of the output noise spectral density when the power of the microwave signal at the input of the devices increases due to the compression of the amplifiers.

The statistical properties of the signal and the noise have also been investigated in order to verify the Gaussianity of the noise at the output of the nonlinear circuits.

The prediction of these instabilities requires a large-signal stability analysis of the circuit. In this paper, oscillations, hysteresis, and chaotic solutions, experimentally encountered in a high-efficiency class-E/F/sub odd/ PA with four transistors combined using a distributed active transformer, are studied through the use of stability and bifurcation analysis tools. The tools have enabled an in-depth comprehension of the different phenomena, which have been observed in simulation with good agreement with experimental results. The study of the mechanism generating the instability has led to a simplified equivalent circuit from which the optimum stabilization network has been determined. The network enables a global stabilization of the circuit for all the expected operating values of the amplifier bias voltage and input power. This has been achieved with negligible degradation of the amplifier performance in terms of drain efficiency and output power. The stable behavior obtained in simulation has been experimentally confirmed.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.856083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.856083","startPage":"3712","endPage":"3722","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/33037/01550020.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global stability analysis and stabilization of a class-E/F amplifier with a distributed active transformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Global stability analysis and stabilization of a class-E/F amplifier with a distributed active transformer","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","volume":"53","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1550020/","accessionNumber":"8675678","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550020/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global stability analysis and stabilization of a class-E/F amplifier with a distributed active transformer","sourcePdf":"01550020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088479S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"33037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"33037","articleId":"1550020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1550023,"authors":[{"name":"S.

It is able to conserve battery power in an idle mode and wake up only when it needs to operate, extending the array system's lifetime. One application of this technology is for use as wireless sensor servers, which act as a relay point between wireless sensors and remote data collectors. The proposed retrodirective array is fabricated and tested at 5.8 GHz and uses an integrated rectenna and an analog switch, which controls a battery power source. When an RF signal is received by the antenna array, it is split between a rectenna and receiver (RX), where most power is sent to a rectenna. The collected dc voltage wakes up the system by activating a switch connected to a battery and the RX. When there is no interrogation, the switch turns off. Furthermore, the second and third harmonic rejection characteristic of a circular sector antenna is introduced so that it makes the system simpler by eliminating a low-pass filter in the rectenna. For the phase-conjugation retrodirective array, second subharmonic mixers are used by employing antiparallel diode pairs, which enables avoiding expensive high-frequency oscillators. It is experimentally demonstrated that the retrodirective array system with the proposed power management can retransmit the received signal toward the source when the received power is greater than -8.5dBm. Application of the retrodirective array system as a multifunctional RX array is also investigated.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.856086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33037","startPage":"3735","endPage":"3743","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/33037/01550023.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive power controllable retrodirective array system for wireless sensor server applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1550023/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive power controllable retrodirective array system for wireless sensor server applications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8675681","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive power controllable retrodirective array system for wireless sensor server applications","sourcePdf":"01550023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081319S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"33037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"33037","articleId":"1550023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1550024,"authors":[{"name":"C.

A synthesizer architecture for an existing frequency plan is introduced along with a discussion on its performance and implementation. An alternative frequency plan and its corresponding synthesizer architecture are also proposed. It is shown how this modified frequency plan leads to a significant simplification in the synthesizer realization. The feasible performance of both synthesizer architectures is evaluated through macromodel simulations using realistic models for the building blocks. Finally, system-level simulation results showing the impact of synthesizer spurs on the bit error rate performance of an MB-OFDM UWB receiver in the presence of interferers are provided.

The design concept is demonstrated by a four-pole parallel-coupled Chebyshev bandpass filter and a compact four-pole cross-coupled elliptic-type bandpass filter. Each filter is composed of four different stepped-impedance resonators (SIRs) for which a general design guideline has been provided in order to have the same fundamental frequency and different spurious frequencies by proper adjusting the impedance and length ratios of the SIR. Being based on knowledge of the coupling coefficients and following the traditional design procedure, the resultant filter structures are simple and easy to synthesize. The measured results are in good agreement with the simulated predictions, showing that better than -30-dB rejection levels in the stopband up to 5.4f/sub 0/ and 8.2f/sub 0/ are achieved by the Chebyshev and quasi-elliptic filters, respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/33037/01550029.pdf","startPage":"3788","endPage":"3793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2005.859869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2005.859869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33037","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1550029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of microstrip bandpass filters with multiorder spurious-mode suppression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip filters","Band pass filters","Resonator filters","Passband","Microwave filters","Microstrip resonators","Design methodology","Resonant frequency","Chebyshev approximation","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip filters","band-pass filters","band-stop filters","Chebyshev filters","elliptic filters","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip bandpass filter","multiorder spurious-mode suppression","bandpass filter design","higher order resonant frequency","Chebyshev bandpass filter","elliptic-type bandpass filter","stepped-impedance resonator","coupling coefficient","filter structure","quasielliptic filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupling coefficient","elliptic-type bandpass filter","microstrip filter","stepped-impedance resonator (SIR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design of microstrip bandpass filters with multiorder spurious-mode suppression","volume":"53","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1550029/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8675687","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of microstrip bandpass filters with multiorder spurious-mode suppression","sourcePdf":"01550029.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055048S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"33037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"33037","articleId":"1550029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":1550085,"authors":[{"name":"C.

There are concerns, however, that the barrage could have a negative impact on the existing habitat and wildlife. Alternatives to the barrage have been put forward including the installation of tidal lagoons which would have a significantly less environmental impact than a full-bodied barrage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Nov.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550085/","volume":"19","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"8666209","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"All at sea [tidal power]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All at sea [tidal power]","sourcePdf":"1550085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024464S","chronDate":"Oct.-Nov.  2005","isNumber":"33039","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8455","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1550085","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IET Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1550165,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

While the past few years have shown a sharp increase in ADC performance, we have shown that performance and power dissipation depend greatly on the ADC structure and the target applications. With the progression of wideband radio systems like UWB and OFDM comes a growing demand to provide faster sampling rates and higher resolutions with lower power dissipation.

For various channel models, we survey recent progress made in system design and discuss efficient source-channel bit allocation techniques, with emphasis on unequal error protection. This article considered JSCC (joint source-channel coding) at the application layer only. Recent research has studied cross-layer optimization where JSCC is applied to both the application layer and the physical layer. The basic task here is to minimize the average distortion by allocating available power, subcarriers, and bandwidth among users at the physical layer and source-channel symbols at the application layer subject to a total resource constraint. Most of the JSCC systems covered in this article can be readily extended to transmit scalable compressed bit streams of video sequences and 3-D meshes. Due to the stringent delay constraints in video communications and the fact that MPEG is currently exploring a scalable video coding standard, fast JSCC algorithms are expected to play a bigger role and bring more performance gains. This article is also expected to stimulate further research efforts into JSCC and more importantly, prompt the industry to adopt some of these JSCC algorithms in their system designs, thus closing the cycle from algorithm development to implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized error protection of scalable image bit streams [advances in joint source-channel coding for images]","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2005.1550192","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/33042/01550192.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2005.1550192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1550192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550192/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Optimized error protection of scalable image bit streams [advances in joint source-channel coding for images]","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1550192/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 2005","accessionNumber":"8678540","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized error protection of scalable image bit streams [advances in joint source-channel coding for images]","sourcePdf":"01550192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136448S","chronDate":"Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"33042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"33042","articleId":"1550192","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1550193,"authors":[{"name":"R.K.

We improve power consumption techniques by providing competitive classification performance even in the low frequency region of 1-10 Hz and for the highly erratic wrist based sensing location. Furthermore, we propose and analyze a collection of selective sampling strategies in order to reduce the number of required sensor readings and the computation cycles even further.

We focus on quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for each communication link in mobile environments. An interference model for wireless multihop packet radio networks, which is more practical than that adopted in earlier literature, is considered. Under this interference model, an approach to guaranteeing conflict-free transmission slots in each frame for each communication link is proposed. We then present a topology-independent link activation scheduling framework based on the theory of group divisible (GD) designs. The proposed framework guarantees conflict-free transmission slots in each frame for each communication link by mathematical properties of GD designs. With the proposed framework, we study and evaluate one series of GD design construction. We then propose topology-independent link activation scheduling algorithms based on the results derived. The proposed schemes are designed for different objectives: maximizing the minimum system throughput and minimizing the schedule frame length.

Currently such classifications rely on selected packet header fields (e.g. port numbers) or application layer protocol decoding. These methods have a number of shortfalls e.g. many applications can use unpredictable port numbers and protocol decoding requires a high amount of computing resources or is simply infeasible in case protocols are unknown or encrypted. We propose a novel method for traffic classification and application identification using an unsupervised machine learning technique. Flows are automatically classified based on statistical flow characteristics.

These networks have to provide a fast, reliable, fault tolerant and energy aware channel for events diffusion, which meets the requirements of query-based, event-driven and periodic sensor networks application scenarios. These requirements have to be met even in the presence of emergency conditions that can lead to node failures and path disruption to the sink. This paper presents HPEQ (hierarchical periodic, event-driven and query-based), a cluster-based routing protocol that groups sensor nodes to efficiently relay the sensed data to the sink. In HPEQ protocol nodes with more residual energy are selected as aggregator nodes that relay data to the sink by uniformly distributing energy dissipation among the nodes, and reducing latency and network data traffic. HPEQ is based on a previous protocol, PEQ, that meets sensor networks requirements for critical conditions surveillance applications. HPEQ uses the publish/subscribe paradigm to disseminate requests across the network. The algorithm was implemented using NS-2 simulator and compared to PEQ and to the directed diffusion paradigm. Important metrics were evaluated showing that the proposed algorithm can be a potential solution to meet constraints and requirements of events delivery in critical conditions monitoring applications","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2005.75","publicationTitle":"The IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks 30th Anniversary (LCN'05)l","displayPublicationTitle":"The IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks 30th Anniversary (LCN'05)l","pdfPath":"/iel5/10397/33047/01550926.pdf","startPage":"560","endPage":"567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2005.75","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1550926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-17 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550926/","displayDocTitle":"HPEQ A Hierarchical Periodic, Event-driven and Query-based Wireless Sensor Network Protocol","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9073389","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1550926/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"17-17 Nov. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HPEQ A Hierarchical Periodic, Event-driven and Query-based Wireless Sensor Network Protocol","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"01550926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055787S","chronDate":"17-17 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10397","isNumber":"33047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10397","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"33047","articleId":"1550926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1550927,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Previous work has exploited dataflow sub-graphs whose execution latency can be reduced via programmable FPGA-style hardware. In this paper we show that mini-graphs can improve performance by amplifying the bandwidths of a superscalar processor's stages and the capacities of many of its structures without custom latency-reduction hardware. Amplification is achieved because the processor deals with a complete mini-graph via a single quasi-instruction, the handle. By constraining mini-graph structure and forcing handles to behave as much like singleton instructions as possible, the number and scope of the modifications over a conventional superscalar microarchitecture is kept to a minimum. This paper describes mini-graphs, a simple algorithm for extracting them from basic block frequency profiles, and a microarchitecture for exploiting them. Cycle-level simulation of several benchmark suites shows that mini-graphs can provide average performance gains of 2-12% over an aggressive baseline, with peak gains exceeding 40%. Alternatively, they can compensate for substantial reductions in register file and scheduler size, and in pipeline bandwidth.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","htmlLink":"/document/1550979/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dataflow Mini-Graphs: Amplifying Superscalar Capacity and Bandwidth","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dataflow Mini-Graphs: Amplifying Superscalar Capacity and Bandwidth","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01550979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056418S","chronDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10398","isNumber":"33048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10398","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"33048","articleId":"1550979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1550980,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Critical computation subgraphs can be accelerated by collapsing them into new instructions that are executed on specialized function units. Collapsing the subgraphs simultaneously reduces the length of computation as well as the number of intermediate results stored in the register file. The main problem with this approach is that a new processor must be generated for each application domain. While new instructions can be designed automatically, there is a substantial amount of engineering cost incurred to verify and to implement the final custom processor. In this work, we propose a strategy to transparent customization of the core computation capabilities of the processor without changing its instruction set. A congurable array of function units is added to the baseline processor that enables the acceleration of a wide range of data flow subgraphs. To exploit the array, the microarchitecture performs subgraph identification at run-time, replacing them with new microcode instructions to configure and utilize the array. We compare the effectiveness of replacing subgraphs in the fill unit of a trace cache versus using a translation table during decode, and evaluate the tradeoffs between static and dynamic identification of subgraphs for instruction set customization.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2004.5","publicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","displayPublicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10398/33048/01550980.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2004.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application-Specific Processing on a General-Purpose Core via Transparent Instruction Set Customization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Application-Specific Processing on a General-Purpose Core via Transparent Instruction Set Customization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1550980/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-Specific Processing on a General-Purpose Core via Transparent Instruction Set Customization","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01550980.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090712S","chronDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10398","isNumber":"33048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10398","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"33048","articleId":"1550980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1550983,"authors":[{"name":"Li Shang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Li Shang","id":"37087023921"},{"name":"L.

With ever-increasing power density and cooling costs, the thermal impact of on-chip networks needs to be urgently addressed. In this work, we first characterize the thermal profile of the MIT Raw chip. Our study shows networks having comparable thermal impact as the processing elements and contributing significantly to overall chip temperature, thus motivating the need for network thermal management. The characterization is based on an architectural thermal model we developed for on-chip networks that takes into account the thermal correlation between routers across the chip and factors in the thermal contribution of on-chip interconnects. Our thermal model is validated against finite-element based simulators for an actual chip with associated power measurements, with an average error of 5.3%. We next propose ThermalHerd, a distributed, collaborative run-time thermal management scheme for on-chip networks that uses distributed throttling and thermal-correlation based routing to tackle thermal emergencies. Our simulations show ThermalHerd effectively ensuring thermal safety with little performance impact. With Raw as our platform, we further show how our work can be extended to the analysis and management of entire on-chip systems, jointly considering both processors and networks.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2004.35","publicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","displayPublicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10398/33048/01550983.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2004.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal Modeling, Characterization and Management of On-Chip Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1550983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550983/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Modeling, Characterization and Management of On-Chip Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1550983/","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Modeling, Characterization and Management of On-Chip Networks","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01550983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067266S","chronDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10398","isNumber":"33048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10398","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"33048","articleId":"1550983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1550984,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The applications can take a very long time to run on real hardware and it is impractical to simulate them to completion on performance models. Furthermore, these applications have complex execution environments that cannot easily be reproduced on a simulator, making porting the applications to simulators difficult. We attack these problems using the well-known SimPoint methodology to find representative portions of an application to simulate, and a dynamic instrumentation framework called Pin to avoid porting altogether. Our system uses dynamic instrumentation instead of simulation to find representative portions - called Pin-Points - for simulation. We have developed a toolkit that automatically detects PinPoints, validates whether they are representative using hardware performance counters, and generates traces for large Itanium\u00ae programs. We compared SimPoint-based selection to random selection of simulation points. We found for 95% of the SPEC2000 programs we tested, the PinPoints prediction was within 8% of the actual whole-program CPI, as opposed to 18% for random selection. We measure the end-to-end error, comparing real hardware to a performance model, and have a simple and efficient methodology to determine the step that introduced the error. Finally, we evaluate the system in the context of multiple configurations of real hardware, commercial applications, and industrial-strength performance models to understand the behavior of a complete and practical workload collection system. We have successfully used our system with many commercial Itanium\u00ae programs, some running for trillions of instructions, and have used the resulting traces for predicting performance of those applications on future Itanium processors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2004.28","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2004.28","displayPublicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10398/33048/01550984.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pinpointing Representative Portions of Large Intel \u00ae Itanium \u00ae Programs with Dynamic Instrumentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pinpointing Representative Portions of Large Intel \u00ae Itanium \u00ae Programs with Dynamic Instrumentation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550984/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1550984/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pinpointing Representative Portions of Large Intel \u00ae Itanium \u00ae Programs with Dynamic Instrumentation","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01550984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046994S","chronDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10398","isNumber":"33048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10398","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"33048","articleId":"1550984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1550992,"authors":[{"name":"F.J.

These threads use the resources of the processor better by sharing them but, at the same time, threads are competing for these resources. The way critical resources are distributed among threads determines the final performance. Currently, processor resources are distributed among threads as determined by the fetch policy that decides which threads enter the processor to compete for resources. However, current fetch policies only use indirect indicators of resource usage in their decision, which can lead to resource monopolization by a single thread or to resource waste when no thread can use them. Both situations can harm performance and happen, for example, after an L2 cache miss. In this paper, we introduce the concept of dynamic resource control in SMT processors. Using this concept, we propose a novel resource allocation policy for SMT processors. This policy directly monitors the usage of resources by each thread and guarantees that all threads get their fair share of the critical shared resources, avoiding monopolization. We also define a mechanism to allow a thread to borrow resources from another thread if that thread does not require them, thereby reducing resource under-use. Simulation results show that our dynamic resource allocation policy outperforms a static resource allocation policy by 8%, on average. It also improves the best dynamic resource-conscious fetch policies like FLUSH++ by 4%, on average, using the harmonic mean as a metric. This indicates that our policy does not obtain the ILP boost by unfairly running high ILP threads over slow memory-bounded threads. Instead, it achieves a better throughput-fairness balance.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2004.17","displayPublicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10398/33048/01550992.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2004.17","publicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","startPage":"171","endPage":"182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically Controlled Resource Allocation in SMT Processors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1550992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically Controlled Resource Allocation in SMT Processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550992/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1550992/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2004","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically Controlled Resource Allocation in SMT Processors","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01550992.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082332S","chronDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10398","isNumber":"33048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10398","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"33048","articleId":"1550992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1550996,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Minos stops attacks that corrupt control data to hijack program control flow but is orthogonal to the memory model. Control data is any data which is loaded into the program counter on control flow transfer, or any data used to calculate such data. The key is that Minos tracks the integrity of all data, but protects control flow by checking this integrity when a program uses the data for control transfer. Existing policies, in contrast, need to differentiate between control and non-control data a priori, a task made impossible by coercions between pointers and other data types such as integers in the C language. Our implementation of Minos for Red Hat Linux 6.2 on a Pentium-based emulator is a stable, usable Linux system on the network on which we are currently running a web server. Our emulated Minos systems running Linux and Windows have stopped several actual attacks.

Conventional access control security mechanisms cannot prevent the illegitimate use of privileged data once access is granted. For example, information provided by a user during an online purchase may be covertly delivered to malicious third parties by an untrustworthy web browser. Existing information-flow security mechanisms do provide this assurance, but only for programmer-specified policies enforced during program development as a static analysis on special-purpose type-safe languages. Not only are these techniques not applicable to many commonly used programs, but they leave the user with no defense against malicious programmers or altered binaries. In this paper, we propose RIFLE, a runtime information-flow security system designed from the user's perspective. By addressing information-flow security using architectural support, RIFLE gives users a practical way to enforce their own information-flow security policy on all programs. We prove that, contrary to statements in the literature, run-time systems like RIFLE are no less secure than existing language-based techniques. Using a model of the architectural framework and a binary translator, we demonstrate RIFLE's correctness and illustrate that the performance cost is reasonable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RIFLE: An Architectural Framework for User-Centric Information-Flow Security","publicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2004.31","displayPublicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10398/33048/01550998.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2004.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1550998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1550998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","displayDocTitle":"RIFLE: An Architectural Framework for User-Centric Information-Flow Security","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1550998/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RIFLE: An Architectural Framework for User-Centric Information-Flow Security","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01550998.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072241S","chronDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10398","isNumber":"33048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10398","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"33048","articleId":"1550998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1551004,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

Block migration (e.g., D-NUCA and NuRapid) reduces average hit latency by migrating frequently used blocks towards the lower-latency banks. Transmission Line Caches (TLC) use on-chip transmission lines to provide low latency to all banks. Traditional stride-based hardware prefetching strives to tolerate, rather than reduce, latency. Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) present additional challenges. First, CMPs often share the on-chip L2 cache, requiring multiple ports to provide sufficient bandwidth. Second, multiple threads mean multiple working sets, which compete for limited on-chip storage. Third, sharing code and data interferes with block migration, since one processor's low-latency bank is another processor's high-latency bank. In this paper, we develop L2 cache designs for CMPs that incorporate these three latency management techniques. We use detailed full-system simulation to analyze the performance trade-offs for both commercial and scientific workloads. First, we demonstrate that block migration is less effective for CMPs because 40-60% of L2 cache hits in commercial workloads are satisfied in the central banks, which are equally far from all processors. Second, we observe that although transmission lines provide low latency, contention for their restricted bandwidth limits their performance. Third, we show stride-based prefetching between L1 and L2 caches alone improves performance by at least as much as the other two techniques. Finally, we present a hybrid design-combining all three techniques-that improves performance by an additional 2% to 19% over prefetching alone.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551004","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wire","Delay","Transmission lines","Prefetching","Bandwidth","Technology management","Hardware","Yarn","Analytical models","Performance analysis"]}],"publicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","displayPublicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10398/33048/01551004.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2004.21","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2004.21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing Wire Delay in Large Chip-Multiprocessor Caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551004/","displayDocTitle":"Managing Wire Delay in Large Chip-Multiprocessor Caches","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2004","htmlLink":"/document/1551004/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing Wire Delay in Large Chip-Multiprocessor Caches","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01551004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107471S","chronDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10398","isNumber":"33048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10398","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"33048","articleId":"1551004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1551007,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Despite the address filtering effects of the CPU's cache hierarchy, there is significant locality and bank parallelism in the DRAM access stream of a web server, which includes traffic from the operating system, application, and peripherals. However, a sequential memory controller leaves much of this locality and parallelism unexploited, as serialization and bank conflicts affect the realizable latency. Aggressive scheduling within the memory controller to exploit the available parallelism and locality can reduce the average read latency of the SDRAM. However, bank conflicts and the limited ability of the SDRAM's internal row buffers to act as a cache hinder further latency reduction. Virtual channel SDRAMovercomes these limitations by providing a set of channel buffers that can hold segments from rows of any internal SDRAM bank. This paper presents memory controller policies that can make effective use of these channel buffers to further reduce the average read latency of the SDRAM.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.2004.22","publicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","displayPublicationTitle":"37th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-37'04)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10398/33048/01551007.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.2004.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Controller Optimizations for Web Servers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Memory Controller Optimizations for Web Servers","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1551007/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551007/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","conferenceDate":"4-8 Dec. 2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Controller Optimizations for Web Servers","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"01551007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055229S","chronDate":"04-08 Dec. 2004","xplore-pub-id":"10398","isNumber":"33048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10398","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"33048","articleId":"1551007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1551064,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Bai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Kai Bai","id":"37561455700"},{"name":"Junshan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Junshan Zhang","id":"37281464300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2423-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1551064","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"We consider multi-access control for the uplink in OFDMA networks.

For the sake of comparison, we also characterize the throughput corresponding to the optimal centralized scheduling by using the extreme-value theory of order statistics. We show that the opportunistic multichannel Aloha scheme is asymptotically order-optimal, in the sense that the only performance loss compared to the optimal centralized scheduling is due to the contention inherent in random access.

Simply put, in this utility based approach, every user in a WLAN attempts to maximize its own utility, and the optimization procedure takes place in two stages: a channel contention phase that arbitrates fair channel access across the users via combining adaptive persistence mechanism with random backoff, and a data transmission phase that determines the transmission duration based on the channel conditions in each transmission round. Furthermore, adaptive beamforming is carried out by using the training signals embedded in the RTS/CTS handshake to enhance the spectral efficiency of the MIMO links. Using a stochastic approximation method, together with the Lyapunov stability theorems, we establish the stability of the adaptive persistence mechanism in the proposed WPF MAC and analyze the fairness across the users therein.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-24 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551084/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1551084/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8969976","conferenceDate":"24-24 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Channel-aware weighted proportional fair medium access control in wireless LANs with MIMO links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel-aware weighted proportional fair medium access control in wireless LANs with MIMO links","confLoc":"Lake Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01551084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071442S","chronDate":"24-24 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10400","isNumber":"33050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10400","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33050","articleId":"1551084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1551102,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

In this paper we consider a similar adaptive framework, and devise call admission control and bandwidth allocation strategies to serve multimedia connections in a CDMA-based 3G cellular network. The architecture aims at maintaining the session's quality during both intra-cell and inter-cell user movements by limiting the cell overload probability. A novel aspect of our work is a method for exploiting a priori knowledge of user mobility patterns to estimate the cell overload probability after some prescribed prediction interval.

If the boundaries cannot be positioned at integer multiples of the chosen spatial step, one usually reduces the spatial step or uses a nonuniform grid. Reported methods for treating such offset metal boundaries require substantial changes in the FDTD code, as well as changes in the grid and the time step. Recently, we proposed an alternative method (Rickard, Y.S. and Nikolova, N.K., 2004), whereby an off-grid perfect electric conductor (PEC) and magnetic boundaries may be modeled without disturbing the original grid. The method employs extrapolation of adjacent field values from the internal computational domain to obtain exterior field values ensuring off-grid virtual boundaries in-between. As only the outer boundary values are modified, the conventional FDTD code and the grid remain unchanged. Time step reduction is unnecessary, thus the high computation speed is preserved. To validate the method, we compare the calculated frequencies of the first few resonant modes of a rectangular resonator to their analytical values when the resonator has off-grid wall(s) in parallel with and slanted to the existing grid. We investigate the accuracy the stability with off-grid BCs and give recommendations for their use.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551258","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33054/01551258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33054","startPage":"118","endPage":"121 Vol. 1A","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slanted walls in the FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Slanted walls in the FDTD method","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551258/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"1A","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8652859","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1551258/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slanted walls in the FDTD method","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035861S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","xplore-issue":"33054","articleId":"1551258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1551259,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Tian Xiao","id":"37275959300"},{"name":"Q.H.

Dey and R. Mittra (see IEEE Microwave Guided Wave Lett., vol.7, p.273-5, 1997) to model curved perfectly conducting objects. The method deforms the grid locally to accommodate the curvature of the PEC surface, and therefore, avoids the staircase error of the conventional FDTD method in approximating boundaries. However, sometimes the deformed grid may be too small to obtain a stable solution. This instability can be removed by using a smaller time step, at the expense of more times steps being required. We introduce an efficient, yet accurate, technique, the enlarged cell technique (ECT), to obtain a stable solution without the need to reduce the time step (Xiao, T. and Liu, Q.H., IEEE Microwave Wireless Compon. Lett., vol.14, p.551-3, 2004). This technique has a clear geometric and physical explanation and is easy to implement. Unlike CFDTD methods, the ECT sacrifices neither accuracy nor efficiency in treating small distorted cells.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33054/01551259.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"125 Vol. 1A","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enlarged cell technique for the conformal FDTD method to model perfectly conducting objects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Electrical capacitance tomography","Computer errors","Forward error correction","Grid computing","Stability","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","conducting bodies","computational electromagnetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enlarged cell technique","conformal FDTD method","curved perfectly conducting object modelling","conformal finite-difference time-domain method","PEC surface curvature","staircase error","boundary approximation","deformed grid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"An enlarged cell technique for the conformal FDTD method to model perfectly conducting objects","isConference":true,"volume":"1A","htmlLink":"/document/1551259/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8652860","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enlarged cell technique for the conformal FDTD method to model perfectly conducting objects","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033221S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","xplore-issue":"33054","articleId":"1551259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1551260,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

An AMR-FDTD (adaptive mesh refinement finite-difference time-domain) technique is proposed for the simulation of large complex structures. The root mesh is refined hierarchically and forms a tree structure. The ratio between the cell sizes of adjacent levels is fixed. The mesh tree is re-created after fixed time steps. The ratio between the time steps of adjacent levels is the same. At each time step of the root mesh, the fields of the upper level are updated first, and then lower levels are updated. In each level of the mesh, PEC, ABC and source conditions are enforced. Except for grid points on perfect electrical conductors (PEC) and absorbing boundary conditions (ABC), the boundary value of a child mesh is interpolated from its upper level mesh. The lower level mesh is updated multiple times until it catches up its upper level mesh. After the entire tree is updated, from bottom up, each lower level mesh updates the fields of its upper level mesh.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33054/01551262.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"137 Vol. 1A","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551262","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AMR-FDTD: a dynamically adaptive mesh refinement scheme for the finite-difference time-domain technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive mesh refinement","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Computational electromagnetics","Printed circuits","Packaging","Tree data structures","Conductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","computational electromagnetics","trees (mathematics)","digital simulation","conducting bodies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamically adaptive mesh refinement scheme","FDTD","finite-difference time-domain technique","computational electromagnetic simulator","complex structures","root mesh","tree structure","mesh tree","time steps","PEC","perfect electrical conductors","absorbing boundary conditions","grid points","boundary value","EM wave propagation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"AMR-FDTD: a dynamically adaptive mesh refinement scheme for the finite-difference time-domain technique","isConference":true,"volume":"1A","htmlLink":"/document/1551262/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8652863","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AMR-FDTD: a dynamically adaptive mesh refinement scheme for the finite-difference time-domain technique","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054063S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33054","articleId":"1551262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1551263,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The latter is a new method which can be measured very fast in a reverberation chamber. It is also more representative of the actual performance of a terminal in a real fading environment than the former. Based on measured results, they conclude that the average fading sensitivity is a promising alternative to TIS measurements for characterizing receive performance of mobile terminals. The reverberation chamber is well suited for both these measurements. Average fading sensitivity measurements can be done faster than TIS and give similar relative results i.e. the average fading sensitivity shows similar difference between the different phones as the TIS results, when they read the sensitivity levels at 0.5% error level.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551339","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33054/01551339.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"412 Vol. 1A","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements of total isotropic sensitivity and average fading sensitivity of CDMA phones in reverberation chamber","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551339/","displayDocTitle":"Measurements of total isotropic sensitivity and average fading sensitivity of CDMA phones in reverberation chamber","volume":"1A","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8661354","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1551339/","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements of total isotropic sensitivity and average fading sensitivity of CDMA phones in reverberation chamber","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058268S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"33054","articleId":"1551339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1551384,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao-Hui Song","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, School of Electronics and Information Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Zhao-Hui Song","id":"37552590100"},{"name":"Jing-Hui Qiu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, School of Electronics and Information Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Jing-Hui Qiu","id":"37532176800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8883-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"1551384","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spirals","Finite difference methods","Broadband antennas","Frequency","Transmitting antennas","Propagation losses","Polarization","Time domain analysis","Dielectric losses","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","UHF antennas","microwave antennas","spiral antennas","conformal antennas","directive antennas","electromagnetic wave polarisation","antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined plane spiral antenna","FDTD method","equiangular spiral line","Archimedean spiral line","conformal mesh technique","gap-driving model","resistance voltage source condition","directional diagram characteristics","circular polarization","0.8 to 5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spiral antenna","Combined spiral antenna","FDTD"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a combined antenna with an equiangular spiral line at the origin, and an Archimedean spiral line at the terminal was proposed.

It was shown through numerous works that the ADI-FDTD algorithm is stable both analytically and numerically even when the Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) limit is exceeded. However, in open-region radiation problems, mesh-truncation techniques or absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) are needed to terminate the boundary. These truncation techniques represent, in essence, differential operators that are discretized using a distinct differencing scheme. When solving open-region problems, the boundary scheme is expected to affect the stability behavior of the ADI-FDTD simulation regardless of its theoretical imperatives. In our previous work we showed that implementing 3rd order Higdon's in 2D ADI-FDTD scheme causes instability. In this work, we extend the work to three-dimensional (3D) space and show that the 3D ADI-FDTD method also can be rendered instable when higher-order mesh truncation techniques are used such as Higdon's operators. This finding shows that the stability of any finite-difference time-domain based scheme cannot be studied independently of the mesh-truncation methods essential for simulation of open-region problems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instable 3D ADI-FDTD open-region simulation","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551505","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33055/01551505.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"145 vol. 1B","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Instable 3D ADI-FDTD open-region simulation","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1B","htmlLink":"/document/1551505/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9249485","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instable 3D ADI-FDTD open-region simulation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042324S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33055","articleId":"1551505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1551506,"authors":[{"name":"Shumin Wang","affiliation":["Kelly Scientific, Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Shumin Wang","id":"37280445600"},{"name":"F.L.

The resulting beampattern is the same throughout all iterations since a solution for the optimal weights is independently computed for each data block.

Plasma has properties very different from those of metallic conductors. In physical experiments, the flexibility of the apparatus is often limited.

Numerical simulation can ease these difficulties, serving as a tool to evaluate the potentials of plasma antennas at low cost and with flexibilities in selecting various complex geometries. It is also useful for analyzing the antenna characteristics by varying plasma properties such as the dimensions of the column, the plasma density, the collision frequency, etc. There are many different ways to simulate the electromagnetic interactions in plasma.

The developed method allows time-domain simulation of problems including very different classes of objects, applying the respective appropriate numerical techniques.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551744","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33056/01551744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33056","startPage":"94","endPage":"97 vol. 2A","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid/sup (3)/: combining the time-domain method of moments, the time-domain geometrical theory of diffraction and the FDTD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid/sup (3)/: combining the time-domain method of moments, the time-domain geometrical theory of diffraction and the FDTD","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551744/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"2A","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670912","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1551744/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid/sup (3)/: combining the time-domain method of moments, the time-domain geometrical theory of diffraction and the FDTD","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551744.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042069S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33056","articleId":"1551744","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1551745,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

Using this model other aspects such as richness of scattering environment (spacing and clustering), the effect of hard versus soft scatterers and pin hole effect can be investigated.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551801","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33056/01551801.pdf","startPage":"305","endPage":"308 vol. 2A","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple electromagnetic model for understanding the operation of a MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551801/","displayDocTitle":"A simple electromagnetic model for understanding the operation of a MIMO system","volume":"2A","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8670962","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1551801/","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple electromagnetic model for understanding the operation of a MIMO system","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094008S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33056","articleId":"1551801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1551802,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

We first evaluated the spatial correlation characteristics. If the number of antennas is less than four when employing only vertical polarization, the spatial correlation becomes greater than 0.9. On the other hand, the antenna configuration employing orthogonal polarization reduced the spatial correlation value to less than 0.8 even if a 2/spl times/2 MIMO channel is used. We next evaluated the channel capacity due to the difference in the antenna configuration. The antenna configuration with the 45 degree slanted polarization obtains the highest channel capacity when the number of the array antennas is less than four at the SNR from 10 to 40 dB in an actual outdoor environment.

The paper presents a fast time-domain method that simultaneously solves for all fields (free-space propagating, cavity bound. and cable guided) on these structures. Specifically, we extend our preliminary solver (Bag/spl caron/er, H. et al., Proc. URSI Symp., p.348, 2004) to include connectors/loads. The proposed method employs three solvers: (i) a time-domain integral equation (TDIE) solver to compute external fields (current densities) on the exterior structure (platforms and cable shields); (ii) a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver to compute guided fields inside cables; (iii) a modified nodal analysis (MNA) solver to compute node voltages on equivalent circuits of connectors/loads. These solvers are coupled at the circuit terminals and cable shields, and the resulting coupled system of equations is solved simultaneously at each time step. The TDIE solver is accelerated by parallel computation and the time-domain adaptive integral method (TD-AIM) (Yilmaz, A.E. et al., IEEE Trans. Anten.

Like the CBMOM technique (Parakash, V. and Mittra, R., Microwave and Optical Technology Letters, vol.36, no.2, p.95-100, 2003), CBFDTD is based on dividing a large structure into relatively small sub-regions, and evaluating the characteristic functions that are localized in each of these sub-regions. The excitation of the sub-regions can either be direct sources that yield primary bases, or be derived from the adjacent regions through interfaces that generate secondary bases. We briefly describe the technique and present some results that validate the approach. The advantage of using the CBFDTD approach is that it can handle very large problems - involving 10/sup 9/, or even larger, numbers of unknowns - that are well beyond the scope of direct methods.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551923","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33057/01551923.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33057","startPage":"18","endPage":"21 vol. 2B","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving very large EM problems (10/sup 9/ DoFs or greater) using the MPI-CBFDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551923","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Solving very large EM problems (10/sup 9/ DoFs or greater) using the MPI-CBFDTD method","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551923/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"2B","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8671077","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1551923/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving very large EM problems (10/sup 9/ DoFs or greater) using the MPI-CBFDTD method","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03852S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33057","articleId":"1551923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1551925,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The original intent of the inventor (WR) was somewhat less ambitious. He wanted to study various interesting configurations of TTD (true time delay) beamforming, and has been somewhat amazed and fascinated to see the evolution of his original idea into its present forms. The paper compares a relatively new TTD technology which, in the near future, for certain usages, may supersede or supplement the Rotman lens - all with the guidance and the blessing of Walt Rotman. Wideband RF phased array beamformers have increasingly stringent requirements as to their performance, given the desire to detect and classify targets with increasing accuracy, and to eliminate false alarms caused by clutter. Instantaneous bandwidths are growing accordingly. Traditional error analyses of phased arrays, which concentrated on spatial patterns, must be supplemented to take into account also pulse distortion created by the transfer function of the beamformer. While these phenomena have been well known for UWB antennas, they have rarely been analyzed for large phased arrays with highly complex feed networks. The paper provides a method to analyze the performance of TTD beamformers and, as an example, shows measured results of a novel photonic beamformer in transmission with a comparison to the traditional Rotman lens.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551925/","isConference":true,"volume":"2B","accessionNumber":"8671078","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1551925/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wideband RF beamforming: the Rotman lens vs. photonic beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband RF beamforming: the Rotman lens vs. photonic beamforming","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079455S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33057","articleId":"1551925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1551930,"authors":[{"name":"O.

This characteristic makes the antenna suitable for integration into systems exploiting the multi-function radio frequency (MFRF) concept, meeting the needs for a future combat system (FCS) RF sensor. An antenna which electronically scans 45/spl deg/ in azimuth has been built and successfully tested at ARL to demonstrate this multiple-beam, shared-aperture approach at K/sub a/ band. Subsequent efforts are focused on reducing the component size and weight while extending the scanning ability of the antenna to a full hemisphere with both azimuth and elevation scanning. Primary emphasis has been on the beamformer, a Rotman lens or similar device, and the switches used to select the beams. Approaches described include replacing the cavity Rotman lens used in the prototype MFRF system with a dielectrically loaded Rotman lens having a waveguide-fed cavity, a microstrip-fed parallel plate, or a surface-wave configuration in order to reduce the overall size. The paper discusses the challenges and progress in the development of Rotman lens beam formers to support such an antenna.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551930","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33057/01551930.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551930","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","startPage":"43","endPage":"46 vol. 2B","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotman lens beam formers for Army multifunction RF antenna applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Rotman lens beam formers for Army multifunction RF antenna applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551930/","isConference":true,"volume":"2B","htmlLink":"/document/1551930/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8671083","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotman lens beam formers for Army multifunction RF antenna applications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551930.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046967S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33057","articleId":"1551930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1551936,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The strength of the method is its simplicity and efficiency for modeling the electromagnetic field within a practical level of accuracy. On the other hand, antenna efficiency is usually calculated from dissipated power, which is a Joule loss, and the input power of the antenna in the original FDTD calculation. However, the results indicate an inappropriate value, even if the geometry is as relatively simple as a planar antenna. The paper points out the difficulties and proposes a solution for the planar antenna case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33057/01551958.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"149 vol. 2B","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna efficiency calculation of planar antenna using FDTD method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planar arrays","Finite difference methods","Conductors","Conductivity","Current distribution","Dipole antennas","Geometry","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic analysis","Electromagnetic modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","antenna theory","computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic fields","dipole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna efficiency calculation","planar antenna","FDTD method","finite difference time domain method","electromagnetic problem analysis","complex geometries","electromagnetic field modeling","dissipated power","Joule loss","input power","planar dipole antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Antenna efficiency calculation of planar antenna using FDTD method","isConference":true,"volume":"2B","htmlLink":"/document/1551958/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8671108","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna efficiency calculation of planar antenna using FDTD method","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039584S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","xplore-issue":"33057","articleId":"1551958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1551960,"authors":[{"name":"J.

As an answer to the quest for faster converging evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was introduced to the electromagnetics domain (Robinson, J. and Rahmat-Samii, Y., IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag., vol.AP-52, no.2, p.397-407, 2004). PSO is a relatively new stochastic evolutionary computation technique, based on the movement and intelligence of swarms. PSO is found to hold a superior position with respect to other evolutionary methods, such as GA. Since PSO is a very recent method, many of its capabilities are still unexplored. It benefits from the inherent simplicity of GA while it converges much faster than conventional evolutionary algorithms. The paper presents a simple and universal design procedure for planar microwave filters. To accelerate the computation phase, an equivalent circuit topology is derived from FDTD formulation. The method is fast and robust and is well suited to the fast paced engineering design environment. As a case study, a microwave band-pass filter is designed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33057/01551990.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"262 vol. 2B","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1551990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1551990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33057","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1551990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of planar microwave filters using a simple FDTD model and particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave filters","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Particle swarm optimization","Evolutionary computation","Band pass filters","Genetic algorithms","Electromagnetics","Stochastic processes","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave filters","finite difference time-domain analysis","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","computational electromagnetics","stochastic processes","equivalent circuits","network topology","band-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar microwave filters","FDTD model","particle swarm optimization","evolutionary algorithms","genetic algorithm","global optimum search","stochastic evolutionary computation technique","equivalent circuit topology","microwave band-pass filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1551990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design of planar microwave filters using a simple FDTD model and particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"2B","htmlLink":"/document/1551990/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8680644","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of planar microwave filters using a simple FDTD model and particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01551990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058809S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33057","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33057","articleId":"1551990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1551993,"authors":[{"name":"Suomin Cui","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"lastName":"Suomin Cui","id":"37087456096"},{"name":"D.S.

The early, nonasymptotic elements generated by this algorithm offer favorable bias/variance characteristics and outperform in mean-square filter estimation error, filters generated by other iterative methods. This paper develops two new algorithms for selecting the best AV filter: a MMSE method that can either utilize a training sequence or can operate in a blind decision-directed mode, and a cyclostationary method that exploits the property that cyclostationary signals generate spectral lines when certain nonlinear transformations are applied to them. These new methods are simulated along with previously derived methods in an adaptive beamforming application, and compared with other common beamforming algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3A","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8680838","htmlLink":"/document/1552233/","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Auxiliary vector selection algorithms for adaptive beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auxiliary vector selection algorithms for adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051392S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33058","articleId":"1552233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1552234,"authors":[{"name":"V.V.

As a consequence, the signals passing through the lower branch of the GSC is decomposed into more appropriate subband components by such filter banks to enhance the interference suppression capability. The determination of the filter bank coefficients alleviates the computational overhead and an iterative procedure is also proposed, which solves the Rayleigh quotient in each iteration.

In this field, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method is widely used for simulation of transient wave propagation. The waveforms obtained from FDTD do not perfectly match theoretical ones. Using the assessment of 5 distinctive waveforms, the paper demonstrates that the UWB waveform has a significant bearing on the numerical dispersion. This observation gives a guide for the production of UWB waveforms relatively robust to numerical dispersion in FDTD. The numerical dispersion level proves to be function of the spatial resolution, /spl chi/, and the energy distribution of the source in the frequency domain. Although the waveforms with low -3 dB bandwidth tend to have low numerical dispersion, the maximum frequency in the spectrum also holds a significant influence on the numerical dispersion. This suggests the possibility of estimating the level of the numerical dispersion from the whole spectrum with a given /spl chi/.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552249","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33058/01552249.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33058","startPage":"329","endPage":"332 vol. 3A","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guideline for a UWB waveform robust to the numerical dispersion in FDTD schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1552249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Guideline for a UWB waveform robust to the numerical dispersion in FDTD schemes","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552249/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"3A","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8680852","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1552249/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guideline for a UWB waveform robust to the numerical dispersion in FDTD schemes","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059106S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33058","articleId":"1552249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1552254,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Many of these studies adopt the approach of using multi-band antennas that support these dual bands, but the bandwidths provided appear to be insufficient. The wide-band antenna is another approach to achieve the desired dual-band, but few reports have studied it. Wide-band antennas that can achieve the bandwidth required are extremely advantageous since they can be manufactured without fine adjustments, such as impedance matching. The paper proposes a novel wide-band antenna, a variant of the conventional discone antenna, for both the base station and the personal station in 2.4/5 GHz-band MIMO-OFDM WLAN systems. The structure of the antennas and their fundamental characteristics, such as the measured S-parameters and radiation patterns of isolated and mounted antennas, are shown for 2/spl times/2 MlMO-OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33058/01552311.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"556 vol. 3A","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1552311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel wide-band antennas for 2.4/5 GHz dual-band MIMO-OFDM WLAN systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Dual band","Wireless LAN","Bandwidth","Manufacturing","Impedance matching","Base stations","Antenna measurements","Scattering parameters","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","conical antennas","microwave antennas","mobile antennas","UHF antennas","antenna radiation patterns","wireless LAN","OFDM modulation","MIMO systems","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide-band antennas","dual-band MIMO-OFDM WLAN systems","IEEE 802.11b","IEEE 802.11g","IEEE 802.11a","discone antenna","base station","personal station","S-parameters","radiation patterns","2.4 to 2.5 GHz","4.9 to 5.725 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Novel wide-band antennas for 2.4/5 GHz dual-band MIMO-OFDM WLAN systems","isConference":true,"volume":"3A","htmlLink":"/document/1552311/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8689427","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel wide-band antennas for 2.4/5 GHz dual-band MIMO-OFDM WLAN systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035364S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33058","articleId":"1552311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1552321,"authors":[{"name":"Youngwook Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Youngwook Kim","id":"37087186197"},{"name":"M.

The rational function is commonly used to model the input impedance of an antenna. One robust method to derive the coefficients of the rational function model is the Cauchy method. Genetic algorithms (GA) have been extensively used for the design optimization of electromagnetic structures. The application of MBPE to the GA optimization of broadband system appears very natural. We apply the Cauchy method to GA in order to speed up the computation time in designing broadband antennas. The Cauchy method can reduce the time for simulating the input impedance in the GA process. A differential RMS error is proposed as the stopping criterion for arriving at a sufficiently accurate Z/sub in/. Using the developed algorithm, two broadband antennas are designed. A sampling gain metric is proposed and found to be 12.4 and 13.6 in the two test cases.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552321","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33058/01552321.pdf","startPage":"590","endPage":"593 vol. 3A","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the Cauchy method to genetic algorithms for broadband antenna design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Application of the Cauchy method to genetic algorithms for broadband antenna design","isConference":true,"volume":"3A","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8689436","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1552321/","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the Cauchy method to genetic algorithms for broadband antenna design","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06369S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33058","articleId":"1552321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1552373,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This method has been successfully used in modeling the interactions of electromagnetic waves with double negative (DNG) materials. Another method, the pesudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method, is superior to FDTD in its linear dispersion relation. Another advantage of PSTD is that all field components are now located at a same position in the unit cell. Therefore, it is more natural to handle the boundary condition on interfaces between different materials. In this paper, FDTD and PSTD are used to simulate the transient evolution of wave propagation in structures with DNG materials. Numerical results are given to provide clear descriptions of the novel wave behaviors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD and PSTD simulations for double negative (DNG) materials applications","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552420","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33059/01552420.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"21 vol. 3B","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1552420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"FDTD and PSTD simulations for double negative (DNG) materials applications","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3B","htmlLink":"/document/1552420/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8689512","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD and PSTD simulations for double negative (DNG) materials applications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04875S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","xplore-issue":"33059","articleId":"1552420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1552431,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Antennas employing digital beam-forming provide the fast and flexible reconfigurability required in such a system without the necessity for moving mechanical parts. The antenna presented is a circularly polarised, 4/spl times/4 element array building block. This module can be used for a digital beam forming terminal transmitting system operating at 29.75 GHz (Baggen, L. et al., IEEE Phased Array Systems and Technology, p.571-76, 2003). The array features a calibration network as well as transmitting circuitry for each single element. This high density integration task is achieved by the vertical integration of antenna and circuitries in an LTCC multilayer module.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3B","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8689576","htmlLink":"/document/1552498/","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"A 30 GHz highly integrated LTCC antenna element for digital beam forming arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 30 GHz highly integrated LTCC antenna element for digital beam forming arrays","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048936S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33059","articleId":"1552498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1552499,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The propagation environment around a mobile station (MS) and a base station (BS) is a multipath environment. Multipath components can be grouped together into so called clusters. We define a cluster as a group of paths with similar directions of departure or arrival in azimuth and elevation and similar time delay of arrival. A 3D deterministic ray-tracing tool is used to calculate the double-directional MIMO channel. The advantage of deterministic ray-tracing in contrast to measurements is that ray-tracing offers the possibility of detailed characterization of all multipaths and investigation of the propagation effects without any constraint concerning the antenna or the measurement equipment. A new automatic procedure to identify clusters in azimuth, elevation and delay at the transmitter and the receiver from ray-tracing data is presented. Based on the ray-tracing simulations, we propose a new iterative procedure to extract multipath clusters. The extracted parameters show clearly that, in macrocellular environments, the number of MS-clusters is much greater than the number of BS-clusters. The presented cluster characteristics help to parameterize MIMO channel models and to make simulation results more realistic.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552530","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33059/01552530.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"413 vol. 3B","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of multipath clusters with ray-tracing in urban MIMO propagation environments at 2 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1552530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552530/","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of multipath clusters with ray-tracing in urban MIMO propagation environments at 2 GHz","volume":"3B","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8689602","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1552530/","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of multipath clusters with ray-tracing in urban MIMO propagation environments at 2 GHz","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038506S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"33059","articleId":"1552530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1552531,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We show results for different orientations of transmit/receive arrays and for various positions of the receive array. We demonstrate the dependence of the predicted MIMO capacity on the site-specific scenario over a range of receive end locations. In various specific situations, adaptive techniques can enhance capacity only to a certain extent depending on the original channel matrix.

Another technique, for miniaturized antenna designs, is polarization/pattern diversity where the antennas are designed to radiate with orthogonal radiation patterns and polarizations as a means to create uncorrelated channels across different array elements. The benefits of pattern diversity have been shown by L. Dong et al. (2003). That analysis, however, did not use realistic channel models. We aim to extend the analysis of Dong et al. to clustered channel models, adopted by the IEEE 802.11n standard body for wireless local area networks (WLANs). We analyze MIMO arrays consisting of circular microstrip antennas to enable pattern diversity and compare their performance against conventional uniform linear arrays. We also model the effect of mutual coupling and measure the performance degradation produced by the near-field effects. We briefly review the channel model and the properties of circular microstrip antennas. Then, we analytically compute the spatial correlation coefficients and evaluate the MIMO channel capacity. Pattern diversity yields better performance than space diversity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern diversity with multi-mode circular patch antennas in clustered MIMO channels","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552537","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33059/01552537.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"441 vol. 3B","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1552537","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Pattern diversity with multi-mode circular patch antennas in clustered MIMO channels","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3B","htmlLink":"/document/1552537/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8689608","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern diversity with multi-mode circular patch antennas in clustered MIMO channels","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120074S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33059","articleId":"1552537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1552566,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The LMS algorithm converges slowly when compared with other complicated algorithms, such as recursive least squares (RLS) (Shubair, R.M. and Merri, A., 2005). On the other hand, the sample matrix inversion (SMI) algorithm has a fast convergence behavior. However, because its speedy convergence is achieved through the use of matrix inversion, the SMI algorithm is computationally intensive. Moreover, the SMI algorithm has a block adaptive approach for which it is required that the signal environment does not undergo significant change during the course of block acquisition. The paper develops an algorithm for robust adaptive beamforming by combining the attributes of the LMS algorithm and SMI algorithm. This new algorithm uses the LMS algorithm, which is simple to implement and not computationally intensive, but with SMI initialization in order to ensure fast convergence. Numerical results verify the improved convergence, accuracy, and computational efficiency of the combined LMS/SMI algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552566","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33060/01552566.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552566","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","startPage":"2","endPage":"5 vol. 4A","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming using LMS algorithm with SMI initialization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1552566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive beamforming using LMS algorithm with SMI initialization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552566/","isConference":true,"volume":"4A","htmlLink":"/document/1552566/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8703566","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive beamforming using LMS algorithm with SMI initialization","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552566.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049878S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33060","articleId":"1552566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1552575,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

The goal is to create a compact polarization-diversity antenna with conical coverage in both horizontal and vertical polarizations. It is well known that a constant current loop creates such a pattern with the electric field in horizontal polarization and that a monopole creates such dependence with the electric field in vertical polarization. The design presented is original in the way it uses slots for approaching the constant current loop pattern. The vertical polarization is realized by the traditional quarter-wavelength monopole with optional top loading for profile reduction. The antenna has been designed using the finite integration algorithm under CST MWS /spl reg/. It has been realized successfully in the laboratory and measured. Measurement results are compared to simulation results and good agreement is found. The antenna is attractive commercially and has been recently filed as a patent application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4A","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8703627","htmlLink":"/document/1552635/","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"A novel antenna suitable for wireless LAN hub","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel antenna suitable for wireless LAN hub","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552635.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035395S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33060","articleId":"1552635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1552637,"authors":[{"name":"Tzung-I Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tzung-I Lee","id":"37290760900"},{"name":"Shinho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Shinho Kim","id":"37279291100"},{"name":"Yuanxun Ethan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yuanxun Ethan Wang","id":"38185874400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8883-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"1552637","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","MIMO","Slot antennas","Radio frequency","Microstrip antennas","Sampling methods","Schottky diodes","Costs","Hardware","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave polarisation","multiplexing","MIMO systems","microstrip antenna arrays","slot antenna arrays","diversity reception","antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact polarization multiplexing antenna","MIMO applications","microstrip slot antennas","multiple-input multiple-output applications","spatial multiplexing of local elements","SMILE","polarization diversity","single RF channel","MMIC","perpendicular slots","4.2 GHz"]}],"abstract":"A compact and novel design of microstrip slot antennas for MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) applications is proposed.

An antenna with two perpendicular slots at 4.2 GHz is fabricated and the polarization diversity is demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact polarization multiplexing antenna for MIMO applications","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552637","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33060/01552637.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"262 vol. 4A","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33060","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1552637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"A compact polarization multiplexing antenna for MIMO applications","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4A","htmlLink":"/document/1552637/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8703629","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact polarization multiplexing antenna for MIMO applications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056561S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","xplore-issue":"33060","articleId":"1552637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1552670,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Ling Li","id":"37087195665"},{"name":"D.H.

These new beamforming techniques based on the signal statistics can remove the restriction on minimum-variance distortionless beamformers, such as the narrow bandwidth of source signals, the spectral distinction between the source signal and interference, etc. We propose a novel efficient blind beamforming algorithm based on the optimization of cumulants. Instead of the existing slow-converging steepest-descent-search algorithm, we derive a new iterative method to achieve the optimal solution. Empirically speaking, our new algorithm requires only a few iterations to reach a satisfactory result. Monte Carlo simulations also show that our iterative blind beamforming algorithm is robust over different signal-to-noise ratio conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552746/","isConference":true,"volume":"4B","accessionNumber":"8652895","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1552746/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Novel efficient blind beamforming algorithm using cumulant optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel efficient blind beamforming algorithm using cumulant optimization","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041679S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","xplore-issue":"33061","articleId":"1552746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1552748,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Source separation has applications that range from radar signal processing to high data rate communications, and to audio engineering. There have been numerous algorithms proposed for source separation in the literature. BSS and principal component analysis (PCA) have also been of particular interest to radar researchers and to audio experts. BSS and PCA are array processing techniques that attempt to decompose an incoming mixture of signals into basic components. A blind approach to signal separation implies little knowledge about the array manifold and other parameters of noise level, angles of arrival, and spectral shape. There are scenarios where it is desired to separate correlated sources using array processing. In situations where little is known about the array manifold, a blind separation approach is the only option. The paper exploits spatial smoothing, a well known technique in parametric array processing applied to BSS of correlated sources, particularly in a convolutive channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552748/","isConference":true,"volume":"4B","accessionNumber":"8652896","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1552748/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spatial smoothing and blind source separation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial smoothing and blind source separation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078953S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","xplore-issue":"33061","articleId":"1552748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1552750,"authors":[{"name":"Dongxin Xu","affiliation":["BBN Technologies, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Dongxin Xu","id":"37349671800"},{"name":"Hsiao-Chun Wu","affiliation":["ECE Department, Louisiana State University, USA"],"lastName":"Hsiao-Chun Wu","id":"37292236100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8883-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-3965"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1491"}],"articleNumber":"1552750","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1552750","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Noise robustness","Adaptive signal processing","Signal processing","Bandwidth","Interference","Noise shaping","Spectral shape","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","optimisation","computational complexity","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind adaptive beamforming","maximum likelihood algorithm","EM algorithm","expectation-maximization algorithm","array signal processing","blind beamforming","spectral shape","adaptation procedure","computational complexity","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","constant-modulus criteria"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552750","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33061/01552750.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"104 vol. 4B","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust blind adaptive beamforming by maximum likelihood with EM algorithm","abstract":"In array signal processing, blind beamforming plays a crucial role nowadays, since it does not depend on the assumption of known source signal bandwidth and the interference/noise spectral shape.

The proposed TDFEM-PSTD algorithm is more efficient than the FEM-FDTD method as it only requires 2 cells per guided wavelength to maintain stability. The newly proposed domain decomposition method (DDM) and mortar technique (Jin-Fa Lee and Volakis, J.L., 2004) are employed on the interface for the transition between two non-conforming domains. Anisotropic uni-axial PML was employed to eliminate the wraparound effect of PSTD. The proposed algorithm is verified numerically.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/10402/33061/01552778.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"204 vol. 4B","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium","doi":"10.1109/APS.2005.1552778","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.2005.1552778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33061","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1552778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TDFEM-PSTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Finite element methods","Distributed decision making","Scattering","Stability","Mortar","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Fast Fourier transforms","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","time-domain analysis","computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","conducting bodies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudospectral time domain method","time domain finite element method","FEM-FDTD method","guided wavelength","domain decomposition method","mortar technique","nonconforming domains","anisotropic uni-axial PML","wave propagation","scattering problem","PEC cylinder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-8 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"TDFEM-PSTD","isConference":true,"volume":"4B","htmlLink":"/document/1552778/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8652920","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"3-8 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TDFEM-PSTD","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01552778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038041S","chronDate":"3-8 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10402","isNumber":"33061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10402","xplore-issue":"33061","articleId":"1552778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1552786,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhe Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Center of Applied Electromagnetic Systems Research, University of Mississippi, MS, USA"],"lastName":"Yizhe Zhang","id":"37422603900"},{"name":"A.A.

BPM is a new frontier in IT-enabled enterprise that supports the monitoring and control of business operations. BPM solutions must be able to efficiently process business events, compute business metrics, detect business situations, and provide the real-time visibility of key performance indicators. In addition, system support is required for the rapid development of BPM solutions and the adaptation of the solutions to the dynamic business environment. We have adopted a meta-model, dubbed the observation meta-model, for capturing the business requirements for BPM, which frees solution developers from low-level programming concerns. We have also used a hybrid compilation-interpretation approach to map an observation model to the runtime executable. First, we extract and refactor the data aspect of the observation model to facilitate runtime access. Second, we compile the operational aspect of the model, such as logic for metric computation and situation detection, into Java code. Third, we develop a runtime engine that interprets the refactored model and dynamically loads the generated code, according to the meta-model. Our framework further enables the evolution and hot deployment of the observation model and provides the platform for several on-going customer engagement efforts","doi":"10.1109/ICEBE.2005.89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEBE.2005.89","startPage":"295","endPage":"304","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on e-Business Engineering (ICEBE'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10403/33062/01552908.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE International Conference on e-Business Engineering (ICEBE'05)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33062","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-driven business performance management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven business performance management","conferenceDate":"12-18 Oct. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1552908/","accessionNumber":"9034676","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1552908/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven business performance management","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"01552908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053962S","chronDate":"12-18 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10403","isNumber":"33062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10403","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33062","articleId":"1552908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1552912,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangzhu Gao","affiliation":["Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Xiangzhu Gao","id":"37420518100"},{"name":"S.

In the coming years portable systems will demand even more NVM with high density and very high writing throughput for data storage application, or with fast random access for code execution. Flash memory has followed the scaling evolution, of the semiconductor map since its introduction in the late '80's but further scaling is becoming increasingly complex as some of the fundamental physical limitations are being approached. While continued research on floating gate techniques should extend the current flash technology capability through the end of this decade, there is increasing interest in new memory storage mechanisms and materials that have promise for scaling through at least the end of the next decade. Among the different NVM based on storage mechanisms alternative to the floating gate concept, phase-change memories (PCM), also called ovionic unified memory (OUM),is one of the most promising candidates, having the potential to improve the performance compared to flash as well as to be scalable beyond flash technology (Lai and Lowrey (2001), Lai (2003), Bez (2004)), In this review, the physics and operation of phase change memory is first presented, followed by discussion of current status of development.

Two different pdf are used in this paper: Gaussian and the distribution obtained by McFadden. We get the error reconstruction functions for both samples.

The most common interaction mechanism is a call level interface (CLI) such as ODBC or JDBC. While there are many advantages to using a CLI - expressive power and performance being two of the most key - there are also drawbacks. Applications communicate through a CLI by constructing strings that contain SQL statements. These SQL statements are only checked for correctness at runtime, tend to be fragile and are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. To solve these and other problems, we present the SQL DOM: a set of classes that are strongly-typed to a database schema. Instead of string manipulation, these classes are used to generate SQL statements. We show how to extract the SQL DOM automatically from an existing database schema, demonstrate its applicability to solve the mentioned problems, and evaluate its performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2005.1553551","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 27th International Conference on Software Engineering, 2005.

Example code that demonstrates the use of the framework can help developers make progress on their task. In this paper, we describe an approach for locating relevant code in an example repository that is based on heuristically matching the structure of the code under development to the example code. Our tool improves on existing approaches in two ways. First, the structural context needed to query the repository is extracted automatically from the code, freeing the developer from learning a query language or from writing their code in a particular style. Second, the repository can be generated easily from existing applications. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by reporting on a case study involving two subjects completing four programming tasks within the Eclipse integrated development environment framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using structural context to recommend source code examples","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 27th International Conference on Software Engineering, 2005.

We present a technique for early prediction of system defect density using a set of relative code churn measures that relate the amount of churn to other variables such as component size and the temporal extent of churn. Using statistical regression models, we show that while absolute measures of code chum are poor predictors of defect density, our set of relative measures of code churn is highly predictive of defect density. A case study performed on Windows Server 2003 indicates the validity of the relative code churn measures as early indicators of system defect density. Furthermore, our code churn metric suite is able to discriminate between fault and not fault-prone binaries with an accuracy of 89.0 percent.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of relative code churn measures to predict system defect density","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 27th International Conference on Software Engineering, 2005.

Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a bandwidth-efficient signaling scheme for wideband digital communications. The main difference between frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and OFDM is that in OFDM, the spectrum of the individual carriers mutually overlap. Nevertheless, the OFDM carriers exhibit orthogonality on a symbol interval if they are spaced in frequency exactly at the reciprocal of the symbol interval, which can be accomplished by utilizing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). With the development of modern digital signal processing technology, OFDM has become practical to implement and has been proposed as an efficient modulation scheme for applications ranging from modems, digital audio broadcast, to next-generation high-speed wireless data communications. For example, the high-speed wireless LAN standard IEEE 802.11a is based on OFDM. We discuss receiver design for OFDM systems signaling through unknown frequency-selective fading channels. In particular, we focus on the design of turbo receivers in a number of OFDM systems, including an OFDM system with frequency offset, a space-time block coded OFDM system, and a space-time coded OFDM system based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"14th Annual International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications, 2005.

The GNLSE is a partial differential equation, whose order depends on the nonlinear and dispersion effects. As this equation is not amenable to analytical solution, the use of numerical integration techniques is mandatory. Different schemes were proposed for the numerical integration of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In this work GNLSE is solved by the split-step Fourier transform method (SSFM) which takes the least computation time among all compared numerical schemes for NLSE, when solution varies slowly with time.

Network information theory has shown that the use of multiple relay nodes in source and destination (S-D) communication makes the capacity of the S-D system logarithmically increase with the number of relay nodes. In [13], we proposed a MIMO relay scheme for a relay network with single source and destination pair; each of the multiple relay nodes performs QR decomposition of backward and forward channels in conjunction with phase control (QR-P-QR). In this paper, we extend this scheme to the MIMO relay network with multiple source and destination pairs. For this aim, we use the group nulling approach to decompose the multiple S-D MIMO relay channel to parallel independent S-D MIMO relay channels, and apply the QR-P-QR scheme in each of the decomposed MIMO relay links.

However, since different types of traffic require different channel quality, considering the difference of quality-of-service (QoS) is important for designing a scheduling algorithm. Furthermore, the necessity of scheduling schemes to be able to handle for uplinks, in the future, are much greater. In this paper, we propose heuristic QoS control for CDMA (HCQ), which is a distributed scheduling method for uplinks using channel information. In HCQ, MSs themselves decide when they should send their packets, and each MS independently adjusts the threshold to decide the packet-sending timing.

Specific emphasis is laid on the design of an ATM-based routing scheme for the ISL part of the system (MEO layer). The approach is to prepare a virtual topology by means of virtual path connections (VPC's) connecting all pairs of end nodes in the ISL sub-network for a complete period in advance, similar to implementing a set of (time dependent) routing tables. The search for available end-to-end routes within the ISL network is based on a new routing Algorithm (S-DRA) integrates the advantages of static routing and dynamic routing. Additionally, a new quick clustering scheme is introduced to monitor the faults to guarantee the usability of VPC. The new algorithm guarantees that: 1) the survey of VPC route is not carried on blindly no longer because of the application of the clustering scheme, 2) the flow of control information is reduced, 3) whereas the channel of link is allowable, it can reduce handover frequency as much as possible.

In order to utilize resource more efficiently, we predict not only the cell to which the mobile will handoff but also when the handoff will occur. Based on the mobility prediction, resource is reserved in terms of signal to interference ratio guard margin (SIRGM) to guarantee some target handoff dropping probability.

Much works have been done on the optimization of the multiuser MIMO antenna weights for maximizing channel utilization. In contrast to the previous works, our main objective is to address the optimization of the number of users' activated spatial modes in minimizing the sum-power of the base station whilst performing MIMO antenna optimization and bit-power allocation of the spatial modes given the data-rate and error-rate constraints of the users. Based on the understanding that the number of activated spatial modes for a user should highly depend on the data-rate and error-rate required by the user, we devise an adaptive SDM algorithm that leads to near-optimal performance as a brute-force approach at much reduced-complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that there is a significant gap between performance with and without adaptive SDM","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2005.1554075","publicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/10412/33074/01554075.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2005.1554075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Space-Division Multiplexing for Multiuser MIMO Antenna Systems in Downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554075/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Space-Division Multiplexing for Multiuser MIMO Antenna Systems in Downlink","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9071461","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554075/","conferenceDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Space-Division Multiplexing for Multiuser MIMO Antenna Systems in Downlink","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"01554075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064943S","chronDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10412","isNumber":"33074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10412","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33074","articleId":"1554075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1554076,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The considerations are reduced to determining a covariance matrix of transmitted signals which maximizes the MIMO capacity under the condition that the receiver has perfect knowledge of the channel while the transmitter has the information about selected statistical quantities which are measured at the receiver. An optimal covariance matrix, which requires information of the Rice factor and the signal to noise ratio, is determined. The transmission scheme relying on the choice of the proposed covariance matrix outperforms the other transmission schemes which were reported earlier in the literature.

OVSF (orthogonal variable spreading factor) codes are variable bit rate code words that not all of them are orthogonal to each other. The code assignment variant used to assign these codes to network nodes is called prefix-free vertex coloring. Code assignment algorithm in MANET tries to maximize throughput and/or bottleneck. In this paper, we show that directional antennas can help us to simplify the interference graph and reduce the conditions that code assignment algorithm should maintain. Simulation results show a significant increase in throughput and bottleneck","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2005.1554095","publicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/10412/33074/01554095.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2005.1554095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved OVSF/CDMA Code Assignment in MANET Using Directional Antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554095/","displayDocTitle":"Improved OVSF/CDMA Code Assignment in MANET Using Directional Antenna","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9071468","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554095/","conferenceDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved OVSF/CDMA Code Assignment in MANET Using Directional Antenna","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"01554095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058533S","chronDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10412","isNumber":"33074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10412","xplore-issue":"33074","articleId":"1554095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1554096,"authors":[{"name":"Chee Kyun Ng","affiliation":["Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, MY"],"lastName":"Chee Kyun Ng","id":"37279922100"},{"name":"M.

However, one of the main problems of the OFDM modulation technique is the large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitting signals. This high PAPR causes in-band and out-band interference when the OFDM signals are passed through an amplifier which does not have enough linear range. Several techniques such as magnitude clipping, block coding, partial transmit sequence (PTS) and pulse shaping have been proposed to reduce the PAPR. In this paper, the pulse shaping technique, which reduces PAPR without introducing uncontrolled in-band signal distortion and out-band frequency spreading, will be investigated. The complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the PAPR, which can be used to evaluate the PAPR reduction performance, is derived for OFDM signals with pulse shaping filters","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2005.1554104","publicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/10412/33074/01554104.pdf","startPage":"473","endPage":"477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2005.1554104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR Distribution Analysis of OFDM signals with Pulse Shaping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554104/","displayDocTitle":"PAPR Distribution Analysis of OFDM signals with Pulse Shaping","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9060410","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554104/","conferenceDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR Distribution Analysis of OFDM signals with Pulse Shaping","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"01554104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057557S","chronDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10412","isNumber":"33074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10412","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33074","articleId":"1554104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1554117,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Cheng","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Industrial Design, University of Western Ontario, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Qi Cheng","id":"37288699700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9132-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2163-0771"}],"articleNumber":"1554117","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Multiple signal classification","Polynomials","Bandwidth","Digital video broadcasting","Demodulation","OFDM modulation","Design engineering","Australia","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","OFDM modulation","polynomial matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["root-MUSIC","OFDM carrier frequency offset estimation","blind carrier frequency offset estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the performance of the root-MUSIC for the blind carrier frequency offset estimation is examined.

In the uplink the lack of synchronism between transmitting mobile terminal equipments also adds up to that impairment. Multiuser detection (MUD) techniques are appropriate to mitigate the MAI problem and interference cancellation (IC) detectors are amongst the most useful techniques for providing efficient implementations for that purpose. Also, it is well known that antenna arrays are another key technique in order to achieve high capacity in emerging wireless systems. In this communication we focus on the two basic IC architectures, SIC and PIC, exploiting through combination multiple signal versions collected by an antenna array. The performance of these multisensor IC detectors, designed for asynchronous uplink transmission on MC-CDMA based systems, is evaluated through computer simulations for characteristic scenarios of the broadband component of future cellular systems. The numerical results show that significant improvements can be achieved when combining spatial diversity and IC based MUD techniques, against conventional single user detection (SUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/10412/33074/01554144.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"663","publicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2005.1554144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2005.1554144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisensor Interference Cancellation Performance in Asynchronous Uplink on MC-CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Multiple access interference","Multiuser detection","Detectors","Antenna arrays","Diversity reception","Multiaccess communication","Propagation losses","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","diversity reception","interference suppression","mobile radio","multiuser detection","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisensor interference cancellation performance","asynchronous uplink","MC-CDMA systems","multiple access interference","orthogonality loss","multipath propagation","transmitting mobile terminal equipments","multiuser detection techniques","interference cancellation detectors","antenna arrays","emerging wireless systems","SIC","PIC","multisensor IC detectors","asynchronous uplink transmission","cellular systems","spatial diversity","single user detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Multisensor Interference Cancellation Performance in Asynchronous Uplink on MC-CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554144/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9071417","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisensor Interference Cancellation Performance in Asynchronous Uplink on MC-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"01554144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085487S","chronDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10412","isNumber":"33074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10412","xplore-issue":"33074","articleId":"1554144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1554154,"authors":[{"name":"G.N.

In this system, each LED of the 2D LED array is individually modulated, and the 2D image sensor recognizes each LED modulated data. However, the received data pattern is degraded due to the reduction of pixel size and/or defocusing of the LED data pattern. This phenomenon corresponds to the degradation of the high spatial frequency components of the received data pattern. To overcome this, we employ a hierarchical transmission scheme at a transmitter and a successive interference cancellation at a receiver. By allocating high priority data to low frequency components and low priority data to high frequency components, the reception of high priority data can be guaranteed. We also attempt to apply interference cancellation to overcome the degradation of high spatial frequency components of the received data pattern.

The presented algorithm is based on decision directed channel estimation (DDCE). And it is made up of two parts: i) reliable region decision (RR) - it identifies reliable region by using characteristics of DDCE scheme; ii) erasure replacement decoding (ER) - it replaces data in the unreliable region with erasure bit, and improves BER performance after Viterbi decoding. And we define 'information error rate' (IER) as a measure of information transmitted to the decoder. By using IER, the coded BER performance of system can be evaluated before the coding procedure. We show that a hard decision with ER has better performance than the conventional soft decision scheme. From simulations, we observe that RR DDCE with the ER scheme performs much better than a general DDCE system","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/10412/33074/01554171.pdf","startPage":"793","endPage":"797","publicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2005.1554171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2005.1554171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable region decision DDCE and erasure replacement decoding of OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","OFDM","Erbium","Channel estimation","Bit error rate","Prediction algorithms","Computational complexity","Fading","Viterbi algorithm","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","error statistics","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliable region decision DDCE","erasure replacement decoding","OFDM system","enhanced channel estimation algorithm","computational complexity","multipath Rayleigh fading channel","decision directed channel estimation","erasure bit","BER performance","Viterbi decoding","information error rate","hard decision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Reliable region decision DDCE and erasure replacement decoding of OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554171/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9071450","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable region decision DDCE and erasure replacement decoding of OFDM system","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"01554171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040617S","chronDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10412","isNumber":"33074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10412","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33074","articleId":"1554171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1554172,"authors":[{"name":"Huimin Grace Guo","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Industrial Design, University of Western Ontario, Kingswood, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Huimin Grace Guo","id":"38272259800"},{"name":"Qi Cheng","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Industrial Design, University of Western Ontario, Kingswood, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Qi Cheng","id":"37288699700"},{"name":"R.

Two most well known approaches are the Euclidean and Berlekamp-Massey (BM) algorithms. This paper presents an efficient hardware implementation for the Euclid's algorithm. According to the design results, the proposed low latency design has only about 72.5% clock cycles of those in H. Lee (2003) and Hsie-Chia Chang and Chen-Yi Lee (2001). In addition, the chip synthesis report shows the proposed design has only 63.6% gate count of H. Lee (2003) and 27% gates of Hsie-Chia Chang and Chen-Yi Lee (2001), respectively.

An LDPC code is a linear-block code for forward error correction, attributed by a sparse parity-check matrix. Iterative decoding of this code is shown to yield bit error rate (BER) performance approaching Shannon limit. However, implementation of decoder for this code is difficult due to the routing requirements of its massive number of data-flow structures in decoding logic. We present a routing approach for a parallel LDPC decoder implementation by 1) analyzing the physical routability limitations and 2) designing the code parameters to limit the interconnect lengths to a bounded region.

From the decision, only unreliable information are re-detected in the next iteration step to reduce complexity.

Carrier frequency offset (CFO), which can induce the loss of orthogonality among OFDM sub-carriers and significant performance degradation, needs to be estimated and compensated for. In this paper, we propose a general CFO estimator based on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation criterion. It will be shown that with the same estimator architecture, CFO can be obtained using either training OFDM symbols, pilot tones, null sub-carriers, or a combination of them. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the channel side information, the performance of CFO estimation can be significantly improved. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed CFO estimator, we will consider an OFDM system using the signal structure of the IEEE WLAN standard 802.11a. Compared with previous work using null sub-carriers alone, it will be shown that by taking advantage of the pilot tones, null sub-carriers, and the channel statistics, the performance of CFO estimation can be improved by about 2 dB","doi":"10.1109/APCC.2005.1554231","publicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/10412/33074/01554231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCC.2005.1554231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33074","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General Carrier Frequency Offset Estimator for Broadband OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A General Carrier Frequency Offset Estimator for Broadband OFDM","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554231/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9071584","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1554231/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General Carrier Frequency Offset Estimator for Broadband OFDM","confLoc":"Perth, WA, Australia","sourcePdf":"01554231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055464S","chronDate":"5-5 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10412","isNumber":"33074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10412","xplore-issue":"33074","articleId":"1554231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1554232,"authors":[{"name":"W.

One of the fundamental problems in imitation is the correspondence problem, how to map between the actions, states and effects of the model and imitator agents, when the embodiment of the agents is dissimilar. In our approach, the matching depends on different metrics and granularity. Focusing on object manipulation and arrangement demonstrated by a human, this paper presents Jabberwocky, a system that uses different metrics and granularity to produce action command sequences that when executed by an imitating agent can achieve corresponding effects (manipulandum absolute/relative position, displacement, rotation and orientation). Based on a single demonstration of an object manipulation task by a human and using a combination of effect metrics, the system is shown to produce correspondence solutions that are then performed by an imitating agent, generalizing with respect to different initial object positions and orientations in the imitator's workspace. Depending on the particular metrics and granularity used, the corresponding effects will differ (shown in examples), making the appropriate choice of metrics and granularity depend on the task and

Finally, lots of experiments of our mobile robot are carried out in many kinds of man-made complex environments, and the control architecture and the robot safety body with our robot is proved valid, which give a solid support for our further research for mobile robot in unknown environments.","doi":"10.1109/CIRA.2005.1554334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIRA.2005.1554334","publicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10413/33075/01554334.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile robot control based on fuzzy behavior and robot safety body in unknown environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554334/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mobile robot control based on fuzzy behavior and robot safety body in unknown environment","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2005","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8615769","htmlLink":"/document/1554334/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile robot control based on fuzzy behavior and robot safety body in unknown environment","confLoc":"Espoo, Finland","sourcePdf":"01554334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038001S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10413","isNumber":"33075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10413","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33075","articleId":"1554334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1554354,"authors":[{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Faa-Jeng Lin","id":"37086996997"},{"name":"Po-Hung Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Hung Shen","id":"37087260780"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9355-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1554354","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554354","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronous motors","Servomechanisms","Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Control systems","Uncertainty","Robust control","Approximation error","Friction","Programmable control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor drives","linear synchronous motors","machine control","neurocontrollers","position control","servomotors","permanent magnet motors","wavelet transforms","Lyapunov methods","control system synthesis","series (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive wavelet neural network","permanent magnet linear synchronous motor servo drive system","track periodic reference trajectories","approximation errors","wavelet basis functions","friction force","adaptive learning","Lyapunov stability","optimal parameter vectors","Taylor series","adaptive bound estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet neural network","Taylor series","Adaptive bound estimation","Permanent magnet linear synchronous motor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIRA.2005.1554354","pdfPath":"/iel5/10413/33075/01554354.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation","startPage":"673","endPage":"678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIRA.2005.1554354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear synchronous motor servo drive based on adaptive wavelet neural network","abstract":"An adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN) control system is proposed to control the position of the mover of a permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) servo drive system to track periodic reference trajectories in this study. In the proposed AWNN control system, a WNN with accurate approximation capability is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics of the PMLSM, and a robust term is proposed to confront the inevitable approximation errors due to finite number of wavelet basis functions and disturbances including the friction force. The adaptive learning algorithm that can learn the parameters of weight, dilation and translation of the WNN on line is derived using Lyapunov stability theorem. Moreover, to relax the requirement for the bound of uncertainty in robust term, which comprises a minimum approximation error, optimal parameter vectors, higher-order terms in Taylor series and friction force, an adaptive bound estimation law is investigated where a simple adaptive algorithm is utilized to estimate the bound of uncertainty. Furthermore, the experimental results due to periodic reference trajectories show that the dynamic behaviors of the proposed control systems are robust with regard to uncertainties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-30 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554354/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8615783","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554354/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"27-30 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Linear synchronous motor servo drive based on adaptive wavelet neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear synchronous motor servo drive based on adaptive wavelet neural network","confLoc":"Espoo, Finland","sourcePdf":"01554354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06242S","chronDate":"27-30 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10413","isNumber":"33075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10413","xplore-issue":"33075","articleId":"1554354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1554444,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Sop Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Sop Lee","id":"37087527697"},{"name":"Hyung-Wook Jang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyung-Wook Jang","id":"37087530333"},{"name":"Jin-Ku Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Ku Kang","id":"37087212355"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9264-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"1554444","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":459},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554444","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Phase detection","Circuits","Phase frequency detector","Signal generators","Charge pumps","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Voltage control","CMOS technology","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","phase detectors","reference circuits","synchronisation","timing circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock and data recovery circuit","serial link","phase detector","frequency detector","bang-bang method","frequency error","charge pump","voltage controlled oscillator","differential buffer","3.125 Gbit/s","0.18 micron","1.8 V"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit for a serial link with a half rate 4x oversampling phase and frequency detector structure without a reference clock is described.

However, the substantial communication overhead between the host workstation and the FPGAs is a major performance bottleneck. Also, mapping an application to FPGAs still remains a daunting job. To address these problems, this paper describes a hierarchical SIMD (H-SIMD) machine design with its codesign of a hierarchical instruction set architecture (HISA). The proposed H-SIMD design uses an FPGA controller to facilitate ease of program development. It also employs a memory switching scheme to overlap communications with computations as much as possible. The two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT2 or 2D-DCT) is enlisted to show the effectiveness of the H-SIMD machine.","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2005.1554510","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2005 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2005 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10415/33077/01554510.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2005.1554510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33077","startPage":"276","endPage":"279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchically-controlled SIMD machine for 2D DCT on FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchically-controlled SIMD machine for 2D DCT on FPGAs","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554510/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8802141","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1554510/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchically-controlled SIMD machine for 2D DCT on FPGAs","confLoc":"Herndon, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01554510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044796S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10415","isNumber":"33077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10415","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33077","articleId":"1554510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1554512,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaohui Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"lastName":"Zhaohui Liu","id":"37274616700"},{"name":"K.

The tools and methods used when designing dynamically reconfigurable systems are influenced by the target application domain. In this tutorial, it is assumed that the application is an embedded processor system implemented in a single platform FPGA. Dynamic reconfiguration will be used to time-multiplex mutually exclusive sub-components in the system architecture that are used periodically. Simulating dynamically reconfigurable systems in RTL simulators has been investigated but RTL simulators normally do not allow the topology of the system architecture to change during simulation. 'Virtual multiplexors', placed at subcomponent I/O interfaces, determine which sub-component receives input and generates output. A reconfiguration controller switches the virtual multiplexors according to a given reconfiguration schedule or algorithm. The design of a dynamical and partial hardware reconfigurable system is however still not sufficient supported by design tools. To accomplish this, the signal lines for communication with the functionality in the reconfigurable area must be placed at a known position, which can be done by using so called macros","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","dynamically reconfigurable application","embedded processor system","single platform FPGA","RTL simulators","virtual multiplexors","reconfiguration controller"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554518","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2005.1554518","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2005 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2005 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10415/33077/01554518.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2005.1554518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554518/","displayDocTitle":"I Models and Tools for the Dynamic Reconfiguration of FPGAs","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8814102","htmlLink":"/document/1554518/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Sept. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"I Models and Tools for the Dynamic Reconfiguration of FPGAs","confLoc":"Herndon, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"01554518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053147S","chronDate":"25-28 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10415","isNumber":"33077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10415","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33077","articleId":"1554518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1554531,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These vehicles need a power plant that is reliable during the lifetime of the car. Battery capacity imbalances stemming from the cell manufacturer, ensuing driving environment, and operational usage affect voltage levels, which must follow adherence to strict limits to ensure the safety of the driver. A variation on an existing method of using a capacitor to shuttle charge from one battery to another to balance series strings of batteries is proposed in this paper. The advancement shown in this paper is to bridge every two balancing capacitors with an additional capacitor, allowing for a balance time that is drastically reduced when compared to the original method. Simulation using an idealized model shows a substantial improvement in balancing time using the new topology.","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2005.1554531","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10416/33078/01554531.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2005.1554531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554531","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double-tiered capacitive shuttling method for balancing series-connected batteries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Double-tiered capacitive shuttling method for balancing series-connected batteries","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554531/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8836227","conferenceDate":"7-7 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double-tiered capacitive shuttling method for balancing series-connected batteries","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"01554531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069335S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10416","isNumber":"33078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10416","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"33078","articleId":"1554531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":1554532,"authors":[{"name":"B.T.

The objective function is defined to maintain wheel slip to a desired level so that maximum wheel tractive force and maximum vehicle deceleration are obtained. All components of fuzzy system are optimized using genetic algorithms. The error based global optimization approach is used for fast convergence near optimum point.

It is desirable in many systems to minimize sensor power requirements. Motivated by the flexibility available with battery powered wireless sensors, this paper presents a new sensor network communication method that significantly reduces the occurrence of message transmissions. This is achieved by applying Lebesgue sampling theory to detect transitions in signal levels between quantized states. Sensor outputs are broadcasted only when significant information has been acquired as a state transition. Consequently, power consumed throughout the sensor network is minimized. Results for a large truck vehicle stability enhancement system are given. The feedback control system is tested in a laboratory system with an SAE-J1939 compliant commercial vehicle network, with a virtual truck implementation for evaluating the effectiveness of the sensor network technique.","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2005.1554562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2005.1554562","startPage":"6 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10416/33078/01554562.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new multisensor network for collision avoidance and jackknife prevention of articulated vehicles using Lebesgue sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A new multisensor network for collision avoidance and jackknife prevention of articulated vehicles using Lebesgue sampling","conferenceDate":"7-7 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554562/","accessionNumber":"8846382","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554562/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new multisensor network for collision avoidance and jackknife prevention of articulated vehicles using Lebesgue sampling","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"01554562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084654S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10416","isNumber":"33078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10416","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33078","articleId":"1554562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1554571,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The automotive industry is still in the process of debating on the fact, as to which device provides the best option in HEVs, for the purpose of load leveling. This paper aims at providing a fair idea with regards to the selection of secondary energy sources, based on vehicle performance characteristics and overall drive train efficiency. The performances of lead-acid (PBA), lithium-ion (Li-Ion), nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd), nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH), and nickel-zinc (Ni-Zn) batteries, as well as ultra-capacitors (UC) are investigated over city and highway driving schedules for a heavy-duty diesel-parallel hybrid transit bus application. Based on the simulation studies for the above-mentioned storage devices, the Ni-MH, PBA, and the ultra-capacitor technologies demonstrate best results in terms of fuel economy and percentage drive train efficiency. On the other hand, the Ni-Zn and Li-Ion batteries show much promise, but still demand a great deal of research and development work, before they become a viable option for HEV applications. Finally, the paper compares and summarizes critical performance characteristics for the energy storage devices under investigation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33078","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10416/33078/01554586.pdf","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2005.1554586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2005.1554586","startPage":"10 pp.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of energy storage device selection on the overall drive train efficiency and performance of heavy-duty hybrid vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554586/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of energy storage device selection on the overall drive train efficiency and performance of heavy-duty hybrid vehicles","htmlLink":"/document/1554586/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-7 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8846342","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of energy storage device selection on the overall drive train efficiency and performance of heavy-duty hybrid vehicles","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"01554586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116462S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10416","isNumber":"33078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10416","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"33078","articleId":"1554586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1554609,"authors":[{"name":"W.

However, easily implementing training algorithms such as back propagation through time and quasi-Newton algorithms require great amounts of memory and computational resources; moreover, those grow geometrically with the size of the time series (number of points in the sample used as training example). In the case of multiple output systems, the complexity of these algorithms grows also in a geometrical form, related to the number of system outputs and the number of hidden layers in the network, thus increasing the computation time to obtain a satisfactory solution. In this paper, some methodological and architectural solutions are proposed to overcome this drawback. The implementation simplicity of back propagation and quasi-Newton algorithms is nevertheless maintained, only their memory consumption and computation time is optimized to obtain a satisfactory dynamical model of a motor compressor group feeding a hydrogen fuel cell (in fact, a multiple input, multiple output system). To accomplish this goal, an artificial feedback loop is implemented and a parallel structure of one-output networks is selected as network architecture. The obtained results show that this architectural and methodological approach can be an interesting training option for complex multiple output system modelling using recurrent neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/VPPC.2005.1554619","startPage":"8 pp.","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10416/33078/01554619.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPPC.2005.1554619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of a motor compressor group feeding a hydrogen fuel cell using recurrent neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hydrogen","Fuel cells","Recurrent neural networks","Power system modeling","Computer networks","Feedback loop","Computer architecture","Distributed computing","Analytical models","Friction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressors","fuel cells","recurrent neural nets","electric motors","backpropagation","Newton method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor compressor","hydrogen fuel cell","artificial recurrent neural network","complex dynamic system","training algorithm","quasi-Newton algorithm","back propagation","artificial feedback loop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Modelling","Fuel cells"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554619/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of a motor compressor group feeding a hydrogen fuel cell using recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554619/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"7-7 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8857602","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of a motor compressor group feeding a hydrogen fuel cell using recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"01554619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059388S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10416","isNumber":"33078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10416","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33078","articleId":"1554619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1554629,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In order to achieve maximum torque per ampere (MTPA), knowledge of the motor parameters is necessary. Due to the high ambient temperature inside the engine cavity and also saturation effect, variation of the motor parameters such as inductances and permanent magnets flux density is not avoidable. Off-line models for estimating the motor parameters are known as a computationally intensive method, especially when the effect of cross saturation and permanent magnet flux deterioration are included. In this paper, a practical maximum torque per ampere control scheme along with a simple parameter estimator for PMa-SynRM is introduced. This method is capable of maintaining the MTPA condition and stays robust against the motor parameters variations. To verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed controller, several simulations and experiments results on a low power laboratory prototype PMa-SynRM have been presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-7 Sept. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1554629/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8857593","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust maximum torque per amp (MTPA) control of PM-assisted SynRM for tractions applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust maximum torque per amp (MTPA) control of PM-assisted SynRM for tractions applications","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"01554629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046041S","chronDate":"7-9 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10416","isNumber":"33078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10416","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33078","articleId":"1554629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1554644,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The inclusion of constraint handling strategies makes the multi-objective robust optimization procedure more pragmatic and the procedure is now ready to be applied to real-world problems.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554663","startPage":"25","endPage":"32 Vol.1","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33079","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33079/01554663.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handling constraints in robust multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554663/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Handling constraints in robust multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1554663/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9004129","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handling constraints in robust multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096073S","chronDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33079","articleId":"1554663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1554664,"authors":[{"name":"K.-J.

The dimensionality of a problem influences the computational complexity in converging to a valid solution. With problems defined in larger and more abstract dimensions, complexity becomes a problem as the solutions presented by the algorithm are more likely to be sub-optimal. An interesting and unique manner to reduce the complexity of binary problems is developed in this paper: angle modulation is applied to generate a bit string to solve binary problems, using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to evolve the function coefficients of a trigonometric model. Instead of evolving a high dimensional bit vector, angle modulation reduces the problem to a four-dimensional problem defined in continuous space. Experimental results show that the angle modulation method is faster than the standard binary PSO, and that accuracy is improved for most benchmark functions used","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554671","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33079/01554671.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33079","startPage":"89","endPage":"96 Vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining particle swarm optimisation with angle modulation to solve binary problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combining particle swarm optimisation with angle modulation to solve binary problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554671/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9004137","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1554671/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining particle swarm optimisation with angle modulation to solve binary problems","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554671.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.165419S","chronDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"33079","articleId":"1554671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1554673,"authors":[{"name":"F.W.

However, it is known that for many-objective optimisation, where there are typically more than three objectives, the algorithms applying Pareto optimality as a ranking metric may loose their effectiveness. This paper compares three different approaches to generating Pareto surfaces on both multi and many objective problems. The first approach is using an established Pareto ranking method (NSGA II), the second combines multiple single objective optimisations in a single run (MSOPS), and the third uses multiple runs of a single objective optimiser. The results demonstrate that much can be gained by generating the entire Pareto set in a single run, when compared to repeated single objective optimisations. It is also clear that NSGA II loses its effectiveness as the problem dimensionality increases - it is more effective to use many single objective optimisations than a Pareto-ranking based optimiser on many-objective problems.

A proof of the shape for an optimal core is provided and a set of highly probable sub-conformations are defined which help to establish the guidelines to form the core boundary. A series of new operators including diagonal move and tilt move are defined to assist in implementing the guidelines. The underlying reasons for the failure in the folding prediction of relatively long sequences using Unger's genetic algorithm (GA) in 2D HP model are analysed and the new GGA is shown to overcome these limitations. The overall strategy incorporates a swing function that provides a mechanism to enable the GGA to test more potential solutions and also prevent it from developing a schema that may cause it to become trapped in local minima. While the guidelines do not force particular conformations, the result is a number of conformations for particular putative ground energy and superior prediction accuracy, endorsing the improved performance compared with other well established nondeterministic search approaches","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554693","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33079/01554693.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"266 Vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new guided genetic algorithm for 2D hydrophobic-hydrophilic model to predict protein folding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554693/","displayDocTitle":"A new guided genetic algorithm for 2D hydrophobic-hydrophilic model to predict protein folding","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9004159","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554693/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new guided genetic algorithm for 2D hydrophobic-hydrophilic model to predict protein folding","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082568S","chronDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33079","articleId":"1554693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1554695,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

Despite the fact that pump scheduling problem involves several conflictive objectives, few studies have considered multi-objective optimisation in terms of Pareto optimality. Our approach links a well-known multi-objective optimiser, SPEA2, with a hydraulic simulator, EPANET, in order to provide a Pareto set of explicit schedules. Since only fixed speed pumps and fixed time intervals are considered, we use a natural binary representation and simple and straightforward initialisation and recombination operators. Unlike earlier studies, feasibility constraints are handled by a methodology based on the dominance relation rather than using penalty functions or reparation mechanisms. We test the proposed approach using a network instance and an assessment of the results is carried out by means of empirical attainment surfaces. The results show that the proposed approach is able to obtain better schedules than the state-of-the-art single-objective algorithm for this network instance and within the same number of function evaluations.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554716","startPage":"435","endPage":"442 Vol.1","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33079","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33079/01554716.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimisation of the pump scheduling problem using SPEA2","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554716/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimisation of the pump scheduling problem using SPEA2","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1554716/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9004182","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimisation of the pump scheduling problem using SPEA2","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554716.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075956S","chronDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33079","articleId":"1554716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1554717,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Dipoles are widely used to approximate the sources of electrical activity inside the brain. In this paper, we introduce a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to the EEG dipole source localization problem. A three-concentric-shell model is chosen as our head model, and the dipole number is restricted to 2. The 2 dipoles, each of which has 3 position elements, are combined and represented as a 6-element particle. Initialized by randomly setting the positions and velocities, the particle swarm evolves iteratively. Reported here are simulated cases to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed PSO-based algorithm. Four groups of dipoles with different physiological meanings are chosen as the tested source models. Simulated cases with 10% noise level are also tested. The results show that PSO is feasible and efficient for the source localization in EEG. Furthermore, compared with the generally accepted genetic algorithm (GA), the PSO algorithm appears to be more accurate and needs less computation time","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554754","startPage":"720","endPage":"726 Vol.1","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33079","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33079/01554754.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A feasibility study of EEG dipole source localization using particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554754/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A feasibility study of EEG dipole source localization using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1554754/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9004220","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A feasibility study of EEG dipole source localization using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Edinburgh, Scotland","sourcePdf":"01554754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053684S","chronDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33079","articleId":"1554754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1554755,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This difference in performance can be mitigated and reversed through the use of a 'guided' mutation operator.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554786","startPage":"958","endPage":"965 Vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33079/01554786.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Population based incremental learning with guided mutation versus genetic algorithms: iterated prisoners dilemma","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic mutations","Genetic algorithms","Computer science","Evolutionary computation","Learning systems","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["population based incremental learning","genetic algorithm","iterated prisoners dilemma","guided mutation operator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Population based incremental learning with guided mutation versus genetic algorithms: iterated prisoners dilemma","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1554786/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"9004252","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Population based incremental learning with guided mutation versus genetic algorithms: iterated prisoners dilemma","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554786.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037453S","chronDate":"5-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33079","articleId":"1554786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1554796,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we will propose a novel algorithm called DAPSO (distributed archives PSO) that makes use of stationary archives to establish indirect communication architecture in the swarms. Moreover, we provide analytical results of the required communication energy in such a scenario. This might be especially important in robot swarms and sensor networks.

Once the aim to reach a high S-metric value is appointed, it seems to be promising to directly incorporate it in the optimisation algorithm. This idea has been implemented in the SMS-EMOA, an evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithm (EMOA) using the hypervolume measure within its selection operator. Solutions are rated according to their contribution to the dominated hypervolume of the current population. Up to now, the SMS-EMOA has only been applied to functions with two objectives. The work at hand extends these studies, by surveying the behaviour of the algorithm on three-objective problems. Additionally, a new efficient algorithm for the computation of the contributions to the dominated hypervolume in three-dimensional solution spaces is presented. Different variants of selection operators are proposed. Among these, a new one is presented that rates a solution concerning the number of solutions dominating it. So, solutions in less explored regions are preferred. This rating is an efficient alternative to the S-metric criterion whenever a selection among dominated solutions has to be made. Comparative studies on standard benchmark problems show that the SMS-EMOA clearly outperforms other well established EMOA. First results on a challenging real-world problem have been obtained, namely the multipoint design of an airfoil involving three objectives and nonlinear constraints. Not only a clear improvement of the baseline design but a good coverage of the Pareto front with a small limited number of points has been achieved.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554838","startPage":"1282","endPage":"1289 Vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33080/01554838.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimisation using S-metric selection: application to three-dimensional solution spaces","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pareto optimization","Automotive components","Design optimization","Evolutionary computation","Extraterrestrial measurements","Pareto analysis","Computer science","Electrostatic precipitators","Genetic mutations","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerodynamics","Pareto optimisation","evolutionary computation","mathematical operators","constraint theory","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["S-metric selection","3D solution spaces","hypervolume measure","Pareto optimisation","evolutionary multiobjective optimisation algorithm","three-objective problem","selection operators","airfoil multipoint design","nonlinear constraints","Pareto front"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimisation using S-metric selection: application to three-dimensional solution spaces","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1554838/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8715411","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimisation using S-metric selection: application to three-dimensional solution spaces","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048197S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"33080","articleId":"1554838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1554839,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

Although evolutionary algorithms have proven to be successful with respect to the optimization goals of proximity and diversity, their capability is bottlenecked by the evolutionary operators' abilities to deal with the complicated search spaces. Furthermore, it is well known that the algorithm's performances in different problems are sensitive to the parameter setting of the operators. In an effort to adapt the evolutionary search ability along the different regions of the search space, this paper proposes a dynamic variation operator whose parameter value is deterministically adapted during the algorithm run so as to maintain a balance between the extensive exploration in the early phase and local fine-tuning in the end phase. Comparative studies with some representative variation operators are performed on different benchmark problems to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed operator.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554839","startPage":"1290","endPage":"1297 Vol. 2","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33080","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33080/01554839.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adapting evolutionary dynamics of variation for multi-objective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554839/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adapting evolutionary dynamics of variation for multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1554839/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8715412","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapting evolutionary dynamics of variation for multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069382S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33080","articleId":"1554839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1554846,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Concerning these problems, we reported that GA is effective for the tracking of the moving ships, and for the tracking of the objects orbiting the earth from observed time series bearing and distance data. In this paper, we report on the analysis for the movement characteristics of an object in sea water from an observed time series sound signal. This analysis is more complex than those of earlier reports. To analyze the movement characteristics, we applied a two-step GA analysis.

We model the mobile agent routing problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, maximizing the total detected signal energy while minimizing the energy consumption and path loss.

Partially complete position and velocity vectors stored in memory are segments cut from the two components of promising solutions over a number of previous iterations, where the size and location of segments are selected completely at random. Elements of external memory (segments) are also associated with their parents' fitness values that are used in retrieving the stored elements. After every iteration, the worst k% of the swarm population is considered and position and velocity vectors of each particle in this subpopulation are partly modified by memory elements retrieved using a fitness-based selection procedure. To update the memory, randomly-sized and randomly located segments cut from the best m% of the current swarm population replaces those memory elements with the worst fitness values. The proposed approach is used for the solution of several benchmark numerical optimization problems for which the obtained results demonstrate that both the speed and solution quality are improved compared to conventional PSO algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554916","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33080/01554916.pdf","startPage":"1875","endPage":"1882 Vol. 2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced particle swarm optimization through external memory support","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced particle swarm optimization through external memory support","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554916/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8715476","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced particle swarm optimization through external memory support","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081344S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33080","articleId":"1554916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1554920,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Mechanisms to use massive computation resources laconically and to search effectively are necessary if large-scale computer systems are available. In this study, a new GA-specific database with the local search mechanism to assure the scalability of search performances against the number of computing resources is proposed. Our database possesses information of searched space, and in addition, the local search for nonsearched spaces is applied using individuals stored in the database. To embed our database in a GA enables us to comprehend the quantitative rate of a searched region during searches. Applying this local search, the searched space can be expanded linearly in accordance with the increase in computing resources and the exhaustive search is guaranteed under infinite computations. The features of the introduced GA are discussed with reference to several types of experiments. This method was applied to primitive functions and test functions of continuous optimization problems. Through such experiments, it was shown that our method ensures an effective exhaustive search and has almost the same performance as a conventional GA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554937/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8715484","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1554937/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improvement of database with local search mechanisms for genetic algorithms in large-scale computing environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improvement of database with local search mechanisms for genetic algorithms in large-scale computing environments","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11118S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","xplore-issue":"33081","articleId":"1554937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1554941,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This ability to filter out erroneous signals is measured by the percentage of winning trades. The trading system is demonstrated empirically to achieve more than 92% of winning trades compared to an average of 70% of winning trades demonstrated by the conventional trading system based on the moving average trading rule.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554951","startPage":"2076","endPage":"2083 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33081/01554951.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing winning trades using a rough set based other-product (RSPOP) fuzzy neural network intelligent stock trading system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Intelligent systems","Intelligent networks","Counting circuits","Competitive intelligence","Computational intelligence","Filters","Signal generators","Investments","Stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stock markets","rough set theory","fuzzy set theory","neural nets","fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rough set based other-product","fuzzy neural network","intelligent stock trading system","computational intelligence techniques","trading decisions","live stock data","moving average trading rule"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing winning trades using a rough set based other-product (RSPOP) fuzzy neural network intelligent stock trading system","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1554951/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8715492","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing winning trades using a rough set based other-product (RSPOP) fuzzy neural network intelligent stock trading system","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053124S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","xplore-issue":"33081","articleId":"1554951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1554956,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Li","affiliation":["The School of Computer Science, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"],"lastName":"Jin Li","id":"37422487000"},{"name":"Xiaoli Li","affiliation":["The School of Computer Science, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"],"lastName":"Xiaoli Li","id":"37280865300"},{"name":"Xin Yao","affiliation":["The School of Computer Science, The University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"],"lastName":"Xin Yao","id":"37276074900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9363-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"1554956","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic programming","Costs","Data mining","Decision trees","Credit cards","Learning systems","Classification tree analysis","Medical diagnosis","Computational intelligence","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","pattern classification","learning systems","data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost sensitive classification","genetic programming","data mining","noncost sensitive learning"]}],"abstract":"Cost-sensitive classification is an attractive topic in data mining. Although genetic programming (GP) technique has been applied to general classification, to our knowledge, it has not been exploited to address cost-sensitive classification in the literature, where the costs of misclassification errors are non-uniform. To investigate the applicability of GP to cost-sensitive classification, this paper first reviews the existing methods of cost-sensitive classification in data mining. We then apply GP to address cost-sensitive classification by means of two methods through: a) manipulating training data, and b) modifying the learning algorithm. In particular, a constrained genetic programming (CGP), a GP-based cost-sensitive classifier, has been introduced in this study. CGP is capable of building decision trees to minimize not only the expected number of errors, but also the expected misclassification costs through a novel constraint fitness function. CGP has been tested on the heart disease dataset and the German credit dataset from the UCI repository. Its efficacy with respect to cost has been demonstrated by comparisons with non-cost-sensitive learning methods and cost-sensitive learning methods in terms of the costs.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554956","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33081/01554956.pdf","startPage":"2114","endPage":"2121 Vol. 3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-sensitive classification with genetic programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554956/","displayDocTitle":"Cost-sensitive classification with genetic programming","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8715494","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1554956/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-sensitive classification with genetic programming","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068101S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"33081","articleId":"1554956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":1554959,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We present and evaluate two alternative heuristics that each attempt to identify a good order for processing the objectives of a given front. We show that both heuristics make a substantial difference to the performance of HSO for randomly-generated and benchmark data in 5-9 objectives, and that they both enable HSO to reliably avoid the worst-case performance for those fronts.

At the second stage, the best solutions from stage one are passed to a Pareto-based hierarchy, where the solution set is judged on Pareto dominance and further improved.

The proposed operator, named CQA (constraint quadratic approximation), can be interpreted as both a local search engine (that employs quadratic approximations of both objective and constraint functions for guessing a solution estimate) and a kind of elitism operator that plays the role of 'fixing\" the best estimate of the feasible set. The proposed operator has the advantage of not requiring any additional function evaluation per algorithm iteration, solely making use of the information that would be already obtained in the course of the usual genetic algorithm iterations. The test cases that were performed suggest that the new operator can enhance both the convergence speed (in terms of the number of function evaluations) and the accuracy of the final result.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1554975","startPage":"2255","endPage":"2262 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33081/01554975.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1554975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constraint quadratic approximation operator for treating equality constraints with genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Constraint optimization","Mathematics","Genetic engineering","Systems engineering and theory","Search engines","Testing","Performance evaluation","Convergence","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","quadratic programming","mathematical operators","constraint handling","iterative methods","approximation theory","convergence of numerical methods","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint quadratic approximation","genetic algorithms","nonlinear problems","nonlinear equality constraints","local search engine","elitism operator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1554975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Constraint quadratic approximation operator for treating equality constraints with genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1554975/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8715507","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraint quadratic approximation operator for treating equality constraints with genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01554975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061478S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"33081","articleId":"1554975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1554979,"authors":[{"name":"Man-Leung Wong","affiliation":["Department of Computing & Decision Science, Lingnan University, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Man-Leung Wong","id":"37087247925"},{"name":"Tien-Tsin Wong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tien-Tsin Wong","id":"37087162528"},{"name":"Ka-Ling Fok","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Ka-Ling Fok","id":"37087286088"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9363-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"1554979","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":320},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Computer graphics","Robustness","Circuit synthesis","Data mining","Performance evaluation","Microcomputers","Concurrent computing","Pervasive computing","Parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","evolutionary computation","parallel algorithms","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel evolutionary algorithms","graphics processing unit","fitness evaluations","graphics cards","ubiquitous personal computers","parallel algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1554979","abstract":"Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are effective and robust methods for solving many practical problems such as feature selection, electrical circuit synthesis, and data mining.

Feature subset selection algorithms employing a wrapper approach typically assess the fitness of a feature subset simply as the accuracy of a given classifier over a set of available patterns using the candidate feature set. For datasets with many patterns for some classes and few for others, relatively high accuracy may be achieved simply by labeling unknown patterns according to the largest class. Feature selection wrappers that only emphasize high accuracy typically follow this bias. Class bias may be mitigated by emphasizing well-balanced accuracy during the optimization algorithm. This paper proposes adding selective pressure for balanced accuracy to mitigate class bias during feature set evolution. Experiments compare the selection performance of genetic algorithms using various fitness functions varying in terms of accuracy, balance, and feature parsimony. Several feature selection algorithms including greedy, genetic, filter, and hybrid filter/GA approaches are then compared using the best fitness function. The experiments employ a naive Bayes classifier and public domain datasets. The results suggest that improvements to class balance and feature subset size can be made without compromising overall accuracy or run-time efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555008/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8723497","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1555008/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Balanced accuracy for feature subset selection with genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balanced accuracy for feature subset selection with genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"01555008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101175S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33081","articleId":"1555008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1555032,"authors":[{"name":"V.R.

Modular neural networks represent one of the ways in which this divide-and-conquer strategy can be implemented. Here we present a co-evolutionary model which is used to design and optimize modular neural networks with task-specific modules. The model consists of two populations. The first population consists of a pool of modules and the second population synthesizes complete systems by drawing elements from the pool of modules. Modules represent a part of the solution, which co-operates with others in the module population to form a complete solution. With the help of two artificial supervised learning tasks created by mixing two sub-tasks we demonstrate that if a particular task decomposition is better in terms of performance on the overall task, it can be evolved using this co-evolutionary model.","doi":"10.1109/CEC.2005.1555032","startPage":"2691","endPage":"2698 Vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/10417/33081/01555032.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEC.2005.1555032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-evolutionary modular neural networks for automatic problem decomposition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Design optimization","System testing","Computer science","Network synthesis","Supervised learning","Humans","Europe","Design methodology","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["divide and conquer methods","evolutionary computation","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["co-evolutionary modular neural networks","automatic problem decomposition","complex computational problem","modular neural network","divide and conquer strategy","supervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Co-evolutionary modular neural networks for automatic problem decomposition","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1555032/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","conferenceDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","accessionNumber":"8723507","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-evolutionary modular neural networks for automatic problem decomposition","confLoc":"Edinburgh, Scotland","sourcePdf":"01555032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094978S","chronDate":"2-5 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10417","isNumber":"33081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10417","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"33081","articleId":"1555032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1555036,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In principle, variable-size solution segments taken from a number of previously promising solutions are stored in an external memory whose elements are used in the construction of new solutions. In the construction of a solution, a solution segment is retrieved from the external memory and used in the construction of complete solutions through evolutionary recombination operators. The aim is to provide further intensification around promising solutions without weakening the exploration capabilities.

The global surrogate model serves to pre-screen the EA population for promising individuals. Subsequently, these potential individuals undergo a local search in the form of Lamarckian learning using online local surrogate models. Numerical results are presented on two multimodal benchmark test functions. The results obtained show that both PR-HSAEA and GP-HSAEA converge to good designs on a limited computational budget. Further, our study also shows that the GP model is suitable for global surrogate modeling in HSAEA if the evaluation function is very expensive in computations.

The use of a degeneration inductor in the input buffer significantly improves the performance of the THA. The THA was fabricated in a commercially-available 0.25 /spl mu/m 200 GHz SiGe HBT BiCMOS process technology. The circuit occupies an area of 1.2 mm/sup 2/, and exhibits -49.5 dBc of total harmonic distortion (THD) when operated at a sampling frequency of 12.5 GHz with an input frequency of 3.0 GHz. Operating from a 3.5 V supply, the total power consumption is 0.7 W.

In this paper we propose a new neural network based technique to address those problems.

Unlike Jacobian linearization, feedback linearization is not only locally valid. The proposed protocol can be applied even without the aid of a mathematical model. A drug dosage regimen, established in this way, will determine the output of the pharmacological system to track very well the therapeutic objective.

A PNL mixing system includes two stages: a linear mixing followed by a nonlinear transformation. In our method, the process to linearize the nonlinear observed signals, the most critical task in PNL model, is carried out by a geometric transformation. The basic idea is that in a multi-dimensional space, a PNL mixture is represented by a nonlinear surface while a linear mixture is represented by a plane. Thus, by transforming a PNL's representing nonlinear surface to a plane, the PNL mixture can be linearized. The hidden sources are then estimated from linearized signals by a linear BSS algorithm. Experiments show promising performance of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555837","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33089/01555837.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33089","startPage":"244","endPage":"249 vol. 1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Post nonlinear blind source separation by geometric linearization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1555837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Post nonlinear blind source separation by geometric linearization","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555837/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8788703","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1555837/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Post nonlinear blind source separation by geometric linearization","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087986S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33089","articleId":"1555837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1555845,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoxu Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaoxu Xiong","id":"37087349960"},{"name":"Derong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Derong Liu","id":"37087145985"},{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Huaguang Zhang","id":"37087145382"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9048-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1555845","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Sequences","Protein engineering","Iterative algorithms","Humans","Sampling methods","Computational efficiency","Genetic mutations","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organising feature maps","proteins","biology computing","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing neural network","motif identification","protein sequences","computational complexity","multilevel structure","pairwise distance","motif patterns","DNA","MSA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1555845","abstract":"Current popular algorithms of motif identification in protein sequences face two difficulties, large computation and insertions and deletions of letters.

The new definition of pairwise distance between motif patterns provided in this paper can deal with more insertions/deletions allowed in a motif than other algorithms.

In this paper, we aim to compare the classification accuracy of a neural network trained on DNA sequences encoded using orthogonal representation of the nucleotides, and a set of high level features from the DNA. In addition to this, we evaluate the impact of different types of non-promoters used in training and testing on the classification accuracy. 872 E.coli promoters were used and three types of non-promoters, which included random sequences with the same base frequency as the promoter sequences, genes sequences selected from E.coli and random sequences with the same base frequencies as the gene non-promoters. Raw DNA sequences were encoded using CODE-4 and high level features, which were outlined by previous researchers and subsequently formally defined in this paper. We found that the high level features did not perform as well for promoter recognition compared with CODE-4 DNA representation, contrary to expectation. The strongest determining factor in classification accuracy was the type of non-promoter used for training and testing. Overall non-promoters from coding regions and random sequences with the same base frequency as the gene non-promoter resulted in the best classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555848/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8788710","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1555848/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Effect of non-target examples on E.coli promoters recognition using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of non-target examples on E.coli promoters recognition using neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555848.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05323S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","xplore-issue":"33089","articleId":"1555848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1555851,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Jiang","id":"37554299100"},{"name":"S.G.

A genetic algorithm evolves the internal structure and associated weights of a BbNN using training patterns that consist of morphological and temporal features extracted from the ECG signal of a patient. The remaining part of the ECG record serves as the test signal. The BbNN was tested for ten records collected from different patients provided by the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The evolved BbNNs produced higher than 90% classification accuracies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555851/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"8802227","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1555851/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ECG signal classification using block-based neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG signal classification using block-based neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555851.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086639S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"33089","articleId":"1555851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1555855,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The determination of harmonic currents is complicated by the fact that the supply voltage waveform is distorted by other loads and is rarely a pure sinusoid. Harmonics may therefore be classified as contributions from the load on the one hand and contributions from the power system or supply harmonics on the other hand. A recurrent neural network architecture based method is used to find a way of distinguishing between the load contributed harmonics and supply harmonics, without disconnecting the load from the network. The main advantage of this method is that only waveforms of voltages and currents have to be measured. This method is applicable for both single and three phase loads. This could be fabricated into a commercial instrument that could be installed in substations of large customer loads, or used as a hand-held clip on instrument.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555858/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8788715","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1555858/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"System and method for determining harmonic contributions from non-linear loads using recurrent neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System and method for determining harmonic contributions from non-linear loads using recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043583S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33089","articleId":"1555858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1555859,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In order to guarantee the convergence of tracking error, analytical methods based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function are proposed to determine the varied learning rates of the PFNN. With the proposed PFNN control system, the mover position of the controlled LIM drive possesses the advantages of good transient control performance and robustness to uncertainties for the tracking of periodic reference trajectories.

Among the few studies that have compared spiking models, little emphasis has been given to the formal description of calibration methods in tuning model parameters. We give an example of calibrating a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with the first-spike time of a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron. We further demonstrate how model parameters can be tuned to minimize subthreshold differences in membrane potential. This example emphasizes the dependencies of calibration methods on other experimental parameters, complicating detailed comparisons of spiking models.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555863","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555863","startPage":"396","endPage":"399 vol. 1","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33089/01555863.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1555863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555863/","displayDocTitle":"Differences in the subthreshold dynamics of leaky integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley neuron models","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"8788717","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1555863/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differences in the subthreshold dynamics of leaky integrate-and-fire and Hodgkin-Huxley neuron models","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058249S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33089","articleId":"1555863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1555880,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Jing Li","affiliation":["Intelligent Computation Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Jing-Jing Li","id":"37558872500"},{"name":"De-Shuang Huang","affiliation":["Intelligent Computation Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"De-Shuang Huang","id":"37275607400"},{"name":"R.M.

In contrast to previous pattern-based approaches to the splice site detection problem, the patterns to be matched are unknown in advance and discovered using a supervised learning approach. We have used a genetic programming based system, PerlGP, to evolve regular expressions and proper length windows for a long sequence in which the evolved regular expressions can effectively characterize and predict the splice junctions. Since the gene splicing process is too complex to be fully understood currently, and the widely accepted consensus sequences only reflect some partial statistical information around splice sites, not to mention defining a splice site. However, our evolved regular expressions may shed new light on the underlying rules that define splice sites. Experimental results demonstrate that using the evolved regular expressions, splice junctions could be accurately characterized, furthermore, these evolved regular expressions could also be employed as a predictor to detect whether a CT/AG containing sequence is a splice site or not. Our experimental results also exhibit that the performance of this approach for predicting human gene splice junctions is competitive compared with some other traditional methods.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555880","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33089/01555880.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33089","startPage":"493","endPage":"498 vol. 1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing human gene splice sites using evolved regular expressions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1555880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing human gene splice sites using evolved regular expressions","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555880/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8802244","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1555880/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing human gene splice sites using evolved regular expressions","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555880.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089644S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33089","articleId":"1555880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1555882,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

In recent years, graphic processing unit (GPU) grows faster than CPU. Graphic hardware venders provide programmability on GPU. In this paper, application of commodity available GPU for two kinds of ANN models was explored. One is the self-organizing maps (SOM); the other is multi layer perceptron (MLP). The computation result shows that ANN computing on GPU is much faster than on standard CPU when the neural network is large. And some design rules for improve the efficiency on GPU are given.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555903","startPage":"622","endPage":"626 vol. 1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33089","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33089/01555903.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network computation on graphic process unit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555903/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network computation on graphic process unit","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1555903/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8802266","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network computation on graphic process unit","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090387S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"33089","articleId":"1555903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1555904,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolei Zhu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Xiaolei Zhu","id":"37421540000"},{"name":"Jizhong Shen","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Jizhong Shen","id":"37558597900"},{"name":"Baoyong Chi","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Baoyong Chi","id":"37337830200"},{"name":"Zhihua Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhihua Wang","id":"37279252700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9048-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1555904","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1555904","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Switches","Threshold voltage","MOSFETs","Linearity","Switching circuits","Circuit simulation","SPICE","Logic functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","BiCMOS integrated circuits","MOSFET","neural nets","electric potential","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit implementation","multithresholded neuron circuit","BiCMOS technology","n-channel MOS transistor","voltage-mode synapse circuit","judgement-converting switch","voltage-controlled current signal","multithresholded judgement function circuit","PSPICE","logic function","propagation delay"]}],"abstract":"By analysing the principle of multi-thresholded neurons (MTNs), a methodology is developed for designing multi-thresholded neuron circuits (MTNCs). First, two n-channel MOS transistors are employed to design the voltage-mode synapse circuit with high simplicity and linearity. Second, a BiCMOS technique based circuit named judgement-converting switch (JCS) is proposed. The JCS whose threshold is voltage-controlled current signal, provides an ability of converting the voltage signal to current signal. Based on this possibility, an approach is put forward to design multi-thresholded judgement function circuits (MTJFCs). Finally, single MTNC is designed for implementing XOR operation at switch level. Simulation results with PSPICE show that the designed circuits not only have the correct logic function but also small propagation delay.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555904","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555904","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33089/01555904.pdf","startPage":"627","endPage":"632 vol. 1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit implementation of multi-thresholded neuron (MTN) using BiCMOS technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Circuit implementation of multi-thresholded neuron (MTN) using BiCMOS technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8802267","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1555904/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit implementation of multi-thresholded neuron (MTN) using BiCMOS technology","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058378S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","xplore-issue":"33089","articleId":"1555904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1555905,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Traditional approaches cope with graphical data structures using a preprocessing phase which transforms the graphs into a set of flat vectors. However, in this way, important topological information may be lost and the achieved results may heavily depend on the preprocessing stage. This paper presents a new neural model, called graph neural network (GNN), capable of directly processing graphs. GNNs extends recursive neural networks and can be applied on most of the practically useful kinds of graphs, including directed, undirected, labelled and cyclic graphs.

J and Tank, D, 1985], [ Wilson, G. V. and Pawley, G. S., 1988], [Kuo-Sheng Cheng, et al.] and their position in the literature is now quite strong, in particular in context of networks aimed at mimicking the thermodynamic behavior of complex physical systems, where a number of theoretical tools and motivations are available, originating from the area of statistical mechanics. As prominent examples of such networks one can invoke Hopfield-type content-addressed associative memories and Boltzmann machines, which are often interpreted within the framework of the spin-glass theory. Yet there are many unsolved questions in theories of such systems. Whereas a lot is known about the characteristics of Hopfield networks learning random independent patterns, less is known about their behavior in the presence of strong correlations, especially in non-zero temperature systems. In this paper we consider non-zero low temperature large-size locally Hopfield neural networks in finite loading regime, learning patterns admitting strong and regular correlation structure (chosen to be periodic for simplicity). Our aim being to find conditions for pattern stability and successful retrieval as depending on the imposed correlation structure, we propose to apply the so-called Pirogov-Sinai theory from statistical mechanics to describe the geometry of pattern stability regions. We check that this theory does match with the experimental data and we investigate some further interesting phenomena that occur in such systems.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555950","startPage":"776","endPage":"781 vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33090/01555950.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase diagrams for locally Hopfield neural networks in presence of correlated patterns","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","Intelligent networks","Stability","Mathematics","Computer science","Associative memory","Geometry","Temperature distribution","Electronic mail","World Wide Web"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase diagrams","Hopfield neural nets","statistical mechanics","stability","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase diagrams","locally Hopfield neural networks","correlated patterns","pattern stability","statistical mechanics","learning patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Phase diagrams for locally Hopfield neural networks in presence of correlated patterns","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1555950/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8690343","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase diagrams for locally Hopfield neural networks in presence of correlated patterns","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05985S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33090","articleId":"1555950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1555952,"authors":[{"name":"T.-N.

The bottom sub-symbolic module is a multi-layer feed-forward neural network trained by a modified Q-learning methodology that employs the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm. The top module is a symbolic system (implemented with a neural network built on-line) where rules are extracted from the bottom module during training, in a fashion similar to the CLARION system. The two modules augment each other in an effort to obtain a better performance than both of the modules acting alone in solving a problem. The originality of this work lies in the use of the advanced scaled conjugate learning algorithm in such a hybrid system. It is expected that the use of this algorithm would provide significant improvements in the performance of the overall system and also make it less dependent on user-selected parameters. This paper emphasises the implementation details, since the system is currently under development, rather that concrete experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555962/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1555962/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8690355","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Symbolic rule extraction with a scaled conjugate gradient version of CLARION","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbolic rule extraction with a scaled conjugate gradient version of CLARION","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053748S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","xplore-issue":"33090","articleId":"1555962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1555982,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This new metric is the result of a global sensitivity analysis, EFAST, performed on the neural network. EFAST is model independent, does not interact with the training stage and does not rely on any assumption regards to local minima for instance, contrary to a wide range of local sensitivity-based saliency measure. EFAST apportions the output variance among all the units, and hence, allows their quantitative ranking. New input selection and node pruning algorithms have been derived and are presented here. Some experimental results are provided and show with a good agreement the efficiency of the approach for inputs selection, system identification and node pruning applications.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555982","startPage":"960","endPage":"965 vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33090/01555982.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new saliency measure for inputs selection and node pruning in neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Sensitivity analysis","Input variables","Polynomials","Testing","Cost function","System identification","Power engineering and energy","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","node pruning","inputs selection","saliency measure","global sensitivity analysis","quantitative ranking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A new saliency measure for inputs selection and node pruning in neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1555982/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8690375","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new saliency measure for inputs selection and node pruning in neural network","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051131S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","xplore-issue":"33090","articleId":"1555982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1555983,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is normally difficult to invert a neural network, but for the new bijective neural network, it is efficient to find an input producing any desired output, and such an input is guaranteed to exist and to be unique. Furthermore, it can be used as one component in building a pdf neural network, which is a neural network with a nonnegative output, and for which it is guaranteed that the integral of the output is exactly 1.0 (as in a pdf function). Both of these can be used for supervised learning using standard error backpropagation. Finally, the new pdf learning algorithm is capable of using those networks to learn a pdf given i.i.d. samples drawn from that pdf, and to then generate new vectors from the learned pdf. This, in turn, allows inversion of a function with non-unique inverses, where each inverse is generated with just a single evaluation of the network.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555983","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33090/01555983.pdf","startPage":"966","endPage":"971 vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1555983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-step neural network inversion with PDF learning and emulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1555983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"One-step neural network inversion with PDF learning and emulation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8690376","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1555983/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-step neural network inversion with PDF learning and emulation","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01555983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046646S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33090","articleId":"1555983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1555984,"authors":[{"name":"T.Q.

Such network connections can be pruned if the resulting accuracy of the network does not change beyond a preset level.

The quantum effects are found to reduce the performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556008/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8690401","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1556008/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Quantum gauged neural networks: learning and recalling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum gauged neural networks: learning and recalling","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07694S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33090","articleId":"1556008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1556009,"authors":[{"name":"T.

However, we illustrate that AANNs may fall short in discriminating between classes that lie close to each other or are overlapping in feature space. To overcome each of the network types' weaknesses, we propose a combined system consisting of one MLP and C AANNs for C-class recognition problems. Experimental results show that we can maintain good discriminatory properties whilst reliably detecting non-class data.

They include a feedforward BSS, trained in the time domain and in the frequency domain, and a feedback BSS, trained in the time domain. First, an evaluation measure of signal distortion is discussed. Second, conditions for source separation and distortion free are derived. Based on these conditions, source separation and signal distortion are analyzed. The feedforward BSS has some degree of freedom, and the output spectrum can be changed. The feedforward BSS, trained in the frequency domain, has weighting effect, which can suppress signal distortion. This weighting is, however, effective only when the source spectra are similar to each other. Since, the feedforward BSS, trained in the time domain, does not have any constraints on signal distortion free, its output signals can he easily distorted. A new learning algorithm with a distortion free constraint is proposed. On the other hand, the feedback BSS can satisfy both source separation and distortion free conditions simultaneously. Simulation results support the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556034","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33090/01556034.pdf","startPage":"1257","endPage":"1262 vol. 2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of signal separation and signal distortion in feedforward and feedback blind source separation based on source spectra","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556034/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of signal separation and signal distortion in feedforward and feedback blind source separation based on source spectra","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8705771","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1556034/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of signal separation and signal distortion in feedforward and feedback blind source separation based on source spectra","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05318S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33090","articleId":"1556034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1556044,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Modular neural networks (MNN) have shown significant learning improvement over single neural networks (NN). For this reason, the use of MNN for pattern recognition is well justified. However, network topology design of MNN is at least an order of magnitude more difficult than for classical NNs. We describe in this paper the use of a hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) for optimizing the topology of each of the neural network modules of the MNN. The HGA is clearly needed due to the fact that topology optimization requires that we are able to manage both the layer and node information for each of the MNN modules. Simulation results shown in this paper prove the feasibility and advantages of the proposed approach. The method of integration of response is based on fuzzy integral and Sugeno measures, where parameter /spl lambda/ also is optimized by means of the hierarchical genetic algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556079","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33091/01556079.pdf","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1405 vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of modular neural networks using hierarchical genetic algorithms applied to speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of modular neural networks using hierarchical genetic algorithms applied to speech recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8762749","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556079/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of modular neural networks using hierarchical genetic algorithms applied to speech recognition","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050285S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33091","articleId":"1556079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1556091,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It has been demonstrated in the literature that class related reject thresholds provide an error-reject tradeoff better than a single global threshold. In this work we argue that the error-reject tradeoff yielded by class related reject thresholds can be further improved if a proper algorithm is used to find the thresholds. In light of this, we propose using a recently developed optimization algorithm called particle swarm optimization. It has been proved to be very effective in solving real valued global optimization problems. In order to show the benefits of such an algorithm, we have applied it to optimize the thresholds of a cascading classifier system devoted to recognize handwritten digits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556100/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8762763","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1556100/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimizing class-related thresholds with particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing class-related thresholds with particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045523S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33091","articleId":"1556100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1556104,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Two standpoints have been considered so far. On the one hand, effective connectivity describes the influence that regions exert on each other. Yet, it requires the prior definition of a structural model that often turns out to be unknown. On the other hand, functional connectivity, based on marginal correlation, sets the framework for exploratory data-driven measures of statistical interdependency between regions. Unfortunately, one usually cannot use this knowledge to infer potential patterns of effective connectivity from the data. In this abstract, we emphasize the main reason why effective connectivity remains out of reach of functional connectivity. More precisely, we show that marginal correlation is unable to deal with mediation. Using a simple instance of structural equation modeling (SEM), we demonstrate how this model entails certain patterns of functional interaction that can be discriminated by functional connectivity and how other patterns cannot be differentiated. We then introduce conditional correlation as a way to achieve such a differentiation and show how it is related to mediated interaction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556104/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8748507","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Heading for data-driven measures of effective connectivity in functional MRI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heading for data-driven measures of effective connectivity in functional MRI","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071791S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33091","articleId":"1556104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1556106,"authors":[{"name":"H.-G.

In this paper, we propose a novel lossless high dynamic range (HDR) image coding method based on the lifting scheme using discrete-time cellular neural networks (DT-CNNs). In our proposed method, the image is interpolated by using the nonlinear interpolative dynamics of DT-CNN. Because the output function of DT-CNN works as a multi-level quantization function, our method adapts for the prediction of HDR image, and composes the integer lifting scheme for lossless coding. Moreover, our method makes good use of the nonlinear interpolative dynamics by A-template compared with conventional CNN image coding methods using only B-template. The experimental results show a better coding performance compared with the conventional lifting method using linear filters.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556132","startPage":"1681","endPage":"1686 vol. 3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33091","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33091/01556132.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless high dynamic range image coding based on lifting scheme using nonlinear interpolative effect of discrete-time cellular neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556132/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Lossless high dynamic range image coding based on lifting scheme using nonlinear interpolative effect of discrete-time cellular neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1556132/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8762790","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless high dynamic range image coding based on lifting scheme using nonlinear interpolative effect of discrete-time cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092811S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","xplore-issue":"33091","articleId":"1556132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1556137,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Grid and high throughput computing model-mining procedures using neuro-fuzzy networks and genetic algorithms generate collections of models composed by sets of time lag terms from the time series, as well as prediction functions represented by neuro-fuzzy networks. The composition of the models and their prediction capabilities, allows the identification of changes in the internal structure of the process. These changes are associated with the alternation of steady and transient states, zones with abnormal behavior, instability, and other situations.

Three datasets with daily measurements were used: surface temperature, sea level pressure and precipitation around the globe. For all datasets, the first extracted component captured the well-known El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon and the second component was close to the derivative of the first one. Several other components with slow dynamics were extracted and together the components appear to capture essential features of the slow-dynamics state of the climate system. The first two components were identified reliably but the following components may have remained mixed, nonlinear DSS could identify the physically most meaningful rotation among them but only linear DSS was within the scope of this paper.

Towards this end, a dynamic multilayer perceptron (DMLP) network with dynamic neurons is considered. The neuron model consists of a second order linear IIR filter and a nonlinear activation function with adjustable parameters. Based on a given set of input-output data pairs collected from the attitude control subsystem, the network parameters are adjusted to minimize a performance index specified by the output estimation error. The proposed dynamic neural network structure is applied for detecting faults in a reaction wheel (RW) that is often used as an actuator in the ACS of a satellite.

Tracking the health state of a machine, even if the machine is working properly, is very critical for detecting, identifying, and localizing the failure (i.e., diagnosis) and estimating the remaining-useful-life of the component/machine (i.e., prognosis) for carrying out proper maintenance. Hidden Markov models (HMM) present us an opportunity to estimate these unobservable health states using observable sensor signals. Hierarchical HMM is composed of sub-HMMs in a hierarchical fashion, providing functionality beyond a HMM for modeling complex systems. Implementation of HMM based models as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) facilitates compact representation as well as additional flexibility with regard to model structure. Regular and hierarchical HMMs are employed here to estimate on-line the health state of drill-bits as they deteriorate with use on a CNC drilling machine. In the case of regular HMMs, each HMM (that is part of a committee) competes to represent a distinct health state and learns through competitive learning. In the case of hierarchical HMMs, health states are represented as distinct nodes in the top of the hierarchy. Detailed results from regular and hierarchical HMMs are very promising and are reported in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556145","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33091/01556145.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33091","startPage":"1752","endPage":"1757 vol. 3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Bayesian networks for machine diagnostics: hierarchical hidden Markov models vs. competitive learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Bayesian networks for machine diagnostics: hierarchical hidden Markov models vs. competitive learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556145/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8762801","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556145/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Bayesian networks for machine diagnostics: hierarchical hidden Markov models vs. competitive learning","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056426S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33091","articleId":"1556145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1556151,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We employ Fisher criterion to measure the discriminability of each spatial histogram feature and calculate features correlation using mutual information.

In this model, the knowledge of how patterns change when objects move is learned and encapsulated in terms of high probability sequences at each level of the hierarchy. Configuration of object parts is captured by the patterns of coincident high probability sequences. This knowledge is then encoded in a highly efficient Bayesian network structure. The learning algorithm uses a temporal stability criterion to discover object concepts and movement patterns. We show that the architecture and algorithms are biologically plausible. The large scale architecture of the system matches the large scale organization of the cortex and the micro-circuits derived from the local computations match the anatomical data on cortical circuits. The system exhibits invariance across a wide variety of transformations and is robust in the presence of noise.

Hence it can be used for real time applications.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556185","startPage":"1989","endPage":"1994 vol. 3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33091/01556185.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fuzzy clustering neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Fuzzy sets","Clustering algorithms","Prototypes","Pattern clustering","Pattern recognition","Joining processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","pattern clustering","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy clustering neural network","learning algorithm","fuzzy sets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A novel fuzzy clustering neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1556185/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8762828","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fuzzy clustering neural network","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060248S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33091","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33091","articleId":"1556185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556209,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Xiang Du","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology, China","Intelligent Computing Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Ji-Xiang Du","id":"37087143230"},{"name":"De-Shuang Huang","affiliation":["Intelligent Computing Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"De-Shuang Huang","id":"37087142703"},{"name":"Xiao-Feng Wang","affiliation":["Intelligent Computing Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Xiao-Feng Wang","id":"37087142467"},{"name":"Xiao Gu","affiliation":["Intelligent Computing Lab, Institute of Intelligent Machines, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"lastName":"Xiao Gu","id":"37087212858"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9048-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1556209","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556209","abstract":"In this paper a new method for recognition of 2D occluded shapes based on neural network using generalized differential evolution training algorithm is proposed. Firstly, a generalized differential evolution (GDE) algorithm is introduced. And this GDE algorithm is applied to train multilayer perceptron neural networks.

Finally, the superiority of GDE training method over traditional approaches to train networks is demonstrated by experiment. The experimental results show that our proposed GDE training method is much efficient and effective.

The global and local features are obtained by applying the LDA-based method to either the whole or part of a face image, respectively. The combined space is constructed with the projection vectors corresponding to large eigenvalues of the between-class scatter matrix in each subspace. It is based on the fact that the eigenvectors corresponding to larger eigenvalues have more discriminating power. The combined subspace is evaluated in view of the Bayes error, which shows how well samples can be classified. The combined subspace gives small Bayes error than the subspaces composed of either the global or local features. Comparative experiments are also performed using the color FERET database of facial images. The experimental results show that the combined subspace method gives better recognition rate than other methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33092/01556212.pdf","startPage":"2030","endPage":"2035 vol. 4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined subspace method using global and local features for face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Linear discriminant analysis","Principal component analysis","Scattering","Pixel","Null space","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Bayesian methods","Computer science","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","vectors","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","combined subspace method","projection vectors","class scatter matrix","Bayes error","color FERET database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","displayDocTitle":"Combined subspace method using global and local features for face recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1556212/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8705789","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined subspace method using global and local features for face recognition","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055777S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33092","articleId":"1556212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1556215,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is observed that the inclusion of some more biological phenomenon in an artificial neural network can make it more powerful.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556234","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33092/01556234.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556234","startPage":"2156","endPage":"2161 vol. 4","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","displayDocTitle":"Learning with single integrate-and-fire neuron","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556234/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8690407","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning with single integrate-and-fire neuron","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09285S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33092","articleId":"1556234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1556236,"authors":[{"name":"Di Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Di Wang","id":"37087276554"},{"name":"N.S.

Propulsion in the lamprey, an eel-like fish, is governed by activity in its spinal neural network. This CPG is simulated, in accordance with Ekeberg's model, and then evolved using genetic algorithm techniques to explore the domain of alternative configurations. Results indicate several suitable controllers exist. The best controller from forty experiments produces a controllable frequency range of 1.42 - 12.16 Hz, a substantial increase on the biological network frequency range (1.74 - 5.56 Hz). Internal connectivity of the evolved network is 16 connections, lower than the 26 connections of Ekeberg's model. Thus, evolved networks can operate over a wider frequency range (than their biological prototype and controllers evolving weights alone) whilst maintaining low system complexity. Evolving advanced yet simple controllers provides solutions which are more attainable in silicon (VLSI), improves performance for task specific control and determines the extent to which nature's solutions are unique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556241/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556241/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8690413","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Increased swimming control with evolved lamprey CPG controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increased swimming control with evolved lamprey CPG controllers","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057857S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"33092","articleId":"1556241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1556251,"authors":[{"name":"H.K.

Since the dynamic characteristics and motor parameters of the LPCM are highly nonlinear and time varying, a TSGAC system is therefore investigated based on direction-based genetic algorithm with the spirit of total sliding-mode control (TSC) and fuzzy evolutionary procedure to achieve high-precision position control.

In an ordinary industrial inspection process cosmetic defect classification involves a lot of subjectivity because the test depends on the appreciation of the cosmetic defect by a human inspector. Therefore, a machine classifier is of great help in order to reduce the effect of the subjectivity. The neural network classifier described in this paper is of relevance because it demonstrates the applicability of ANN to solve real world problems. The classifier also helped to discover a bias criteria during the inspection performed by human inspectors. Besides, the performance of the neural network impacts positively in the cost of incorrect decisions during cosmetic lens inspection. The paper shows the performance of several ANN classifiers designed. The best classifier turned out to be a multilayer perceptron trained with the backpropagation algorithm. This classifier has 94% of correct classification and solves the controversies between the production and quality departments due to subjectivity of the inspection.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556265","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33092/01556265.pdf","startPage":"2330","endPage":"2334 vol. 4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cosmetic defect classification found in ophthalmic lenses using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","displayDocTitle":"Cosmetic defect classification found in ophthalmic lenses using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8946092","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556265/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cosmetic defect classification found in ophthalmic lenses using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085211S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33092","articleId":"1556265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1556267,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Hu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

ANN system inverse models are developed using engine test-stand vibration data and on-airplane vibration and noise data supplemented with influence coefficient empirical data. The inverse models are able to determine balance solutions that satisfy cabin noise specifications. The accuracy of the ANN model with respect to the real system is determined by the quantity and quality of test stand and operational aircraft data.

A model-based adaptive nonlinear parameter estimation technique is used based on a highly accurate reaction wheel dynamical model while each parameter is an indication of a specific type of fault in the system. The estimation is based on the nonlinear finite-memory filtering strategy that is solved for optimal estimation functions. To make the optimization feasible for on-line application, the optimal estimation functions are approximated by MLP neural networks thus reducing the functional optimization problem to a nonlinear programming problem, namely, the optimization of the neural weights. The well-known standard back-propagation algorithm and backpropagation through-time algorithm were employed inside the neural adaptation algorithms to obtain the required gradients. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the methodology for the proposed application.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556268","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33092/01556268.pdf","startPage":"2347","endPage":"2352 vol. 4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic neural network-based estimator for fault diagnosis in reaction wheel actuator of satellite attitude control system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic neural network-based estimator for fault diagnosis in reaction wheel actuator of satellite attitude control system","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8946095","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic neural network-based estimator for fault diagnosis in reaction wheel actuator of satellite attitude control system","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036656S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","isNumber":"33092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1556268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":1556269,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tao Liu","id":"37087331335"},{"name":"Wenjun Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenjun Zhang","id":"37087073505"},{"name":"Zhiping Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhiping Yu","id":"37087066156"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9048-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1556269","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556269","abstract":"A new model for spiral inductors, which covers wide operation frequency range and full design parameters, is proposed by using artificial neural network (ANN).

The comparison of the simulation based results to the measured ones reveals the strong ability of the identified RVTDNN to accurately predict the dynamic nonlinear behavior of a 90-Watt LDMOS power amplifier under a two-carrier 3GPP-FDD excitation signal.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556274","startPage":"2378","endPage":"2382 vol. 4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33092","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33092/01556274.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks to 3G power amplifier modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556274/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks to 3G power amplifier modeling","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1556274/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8946100","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks to 3G power amplifier modeling","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062453S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","xplore-issue":"33092","articleId":"1556274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1556277,"authors":[{"name":"A.T.

HRV is easily derived from infant electrocardiograms (ECG), but sleep state scoring is a time consuming task using many physiological signals. We propose a technique to reliably determine sleep and wake using only the ECG. The method would be tested with simultaneous ECG and polysomnograph (PSG) determined sleep scores from the Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation (CHIME) study. The advantages include high accuracy, simplicity of use, and low intrusiveness, with design including rejection to increase reliability valuable for determining sleep-wake states in highly sensitive groups such as infants. Learning vector quantization and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks are tested as the predictors. The manual PSG scored test set has 38,121 (67.8%) sleep and 18,076 (32.2%) wake epochs for a total of 56,197 epochs. The MLP classification of the entire test set resulted in 77.7% agreement with the PSG sleep epochs and 79.0% with wake. The rejection scheme applied to the MLP resulted in 28.9% of sleep and wake epochs meeting the rejection criterion. Of the remaining 39,946 epochs 86.0% are in agreement with the PSG sleep epochs and 85.4% with wake. After systematic rejection of difficult to classify segments, this model can achieve 85%-86% correct classification while rejecting only 30% of the data.

Automatic artifact detection is a key topic, because we aim to automatically analyse and extract features from the data. In literature, independent component analysis (ICA) has been exploited for artifact isolation and the joint use of some high order statistics, kurtosis and Shannon's entropy has been exploited to automatically detect the artifacts.

Previously, neural networks dealing with the input and output data in a decimal format have been proposed. However, accuracy is not sufficient. In this paper, a neural network following a binary approach is proposed. The input TV as well as the desired output p were expressed in a binary form. The proposed neural network is expected to be more stable, i.e. less sensitive to small errors in the network outputs. Simulations have been performed and the results are compared with the results reported in the previous study. The number of required search times for the true prime number can be well reduced. Furthermore, the probability density function of the training patterns is investigated and the need for different data creation and/or selection techniques is shown.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556309","startPage":"2577","endPage":"2582 vol. 4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33092","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33092/01556309.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks following a binary approach applied to the integer prime-factorization problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556309/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural networks following a binary approach applied to the integer prime-factorization problem","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1556309/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8705816","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks following a binary approach applied to the integer prime-factorization problem","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06428S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33092","articleId":"1556309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556311,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Most power quality disturbances are non-stationary and transitory and the detection and classification have proved to be very demanding. New intelligent system technologies using wavelet transform, expert systems and artificial neural networks provide some unique advantages regarding fault analysis. This paper presents new approach aimed at automating the analysis of power quality disturbances including sag, swell, transient, fluctuation, interruption and normal waveform. The approach focuses on the application of discrete wavelet transform technique to extract features from disturbance waveforms and their classification using a powerful combination of neural network and fuzzy logic. The system is modelled using VHDL followed by extensive testing and simulation to verify the correct functionality of the system. Then, the design is synthesized to Mercury EP1M120F484C5 FPGA, tested and validated. Comparisons, verification and analysis made from the results obtained from the application of this system on software-generated and utility sampled disturbance signals validate the utility of this approach and achieved a classification accuracy of 98.17%.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556315","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33092/01556315.pdf","startPage":"2613","endPage":"2618 vol. 4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA realization of power quality disturbance detection: an approach with wavelet, ANN and fuzzy logic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","displayDocTitle":"FPGA realization of power quality disturbance detection: an approach with wavelet, ANN and fuzzy logic","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1556315/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8705822","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA realization of power quality disturbance detection: an approach with wavelet, ANN and fuzzy logic","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068303S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33092","articleId":"1556315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1556318,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The neural network solutions provided superior flood event predictions and their use for subsequent hydrological modelling and flood engineering applications is recommended.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556319","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33092/01556319.pdf","startPage":"2637","endPage":"2642 vol. 4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network modelling of the 20-year flood event for catchments across the UK","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","displayDocTitle":"Neural network modelling of the 20-year flood event for catchments across the UK","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8705826","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556319/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network modelling of the 20-year flood event for catchments across the UK","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086993S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33092","articleId":"1556319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1556346,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Recently, Wavelet networks (WNs) have been shown to be a promising alternative to traditional neural networks. In this study, the robustness of WNs and ANNs in modeling two distinct time series is investigated. The first series represents a chaotic system (Henon map) and the second series represents a stochastic geophysical time series (streamflows). Monthly streamflow values of the English river between Umferville and Sioux Lookout, ON, Canada, are considered in this study. For the implementation of traditional ANNs, the weights and bias values are optimized using genetic algorithms (GAs). However, in WNs, along with weights and bias, the translation and dilation factors of wavelets are also optimized. Use of GAs to optimize the network parameters is to overcome the problem of convergence towards local optima. Results from the study indicate that, WNs are more suitable for modeling short time high frequency time series like Henon map. However, performance of WNs is comparable with that of ANNs in modeling low frequency time series like streamflows.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556346/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8774025","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1556346/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wavelet networks: an alternative to classical neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet networks: an alternative to classical neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050484S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33093","articleId":"1556346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1556353,"authors":[{"name":"T.G.

Similar to what happens in nature, organisms display self-healing: a homeostatic process which allows proper operation while suffering faults. In this paper we present a system which evolves developing spiking neural networks capable of controlling simulated Khepera robots in a wall avoidance task. Development is controlled by a decentralized process executed by each cell's identical growth program. To test the system's self-healing capability, networks are (1) subjected to random faults during development and (2) mutilated during operation. Results demonstrate how development can (i) rapidly produce proper neuro-controllers and (ii) re-grow neurons to recover normal operation. These results show that development, originally proposed to increase the evolvability of large phenotypes, also allow the production of artifacts with sustained fault-tolerance. These artifacts would be especially well-suited for tasks that require long periods of operation in absence of external maintenance.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556370","startPage":"2808","endPage":"2813 vol. 5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33093","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33093/01556370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-tolerance by regeneration: using development to achieve robust self-healing neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556370/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault-tolerance by regeneration: using development to achieve robust self-healing neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1556370/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8774049","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-tolerance by regeneration: using development to achieve robust self-healing neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052132S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","xplore-issue":"33093","articleId":"1556370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1556375,"authors":[{"name":"Shuyuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Intelligence Information Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Shuyuan Yang","id":"37087194942"},{"name":"Min Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Lab of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Min Wang","id":"37087207043"},{"name":"Licheng Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Lab of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Licheng Jiao","id":"37086741706"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9048-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1556375","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Particle swarm optimization","Function approximation","Fuzzy control","Support vector machines","Fourier transforms","Neural networks","Convergence","Risk management","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regression analysis","particle swarm optimisation","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ridgelet kernel approach","particle swarm optimization","multivariate function approximation","ridgelet theory","regularized kernel regression","quadratic programming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556375","abstract":"In this paper, a ridgelet kernel approach is proposed for approximation of multivariate functions, especially those with certain kinds of spatial inhomogeneities.

This problem has been solved utilizing feed-forward neural networks (FNN) when all state information necessary to specify the dynamics is provided as input (Kretchmar, 2000). Time-delayed neural networks (TDNN) solve this problem with finite-size windows of incomplete state information. Our research demonstrates that the ESN architecture represents the Q-function of the MSD system given incomplete state information as well as current feed forward neural networks given either perfect state or a temporally-windowed, incomplete state vector. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce basic concepts of reinforcement learning and the echo state network architecture. The MSD system simulation is defined in section IV. Experimental results for learning state quality given incomplete state information are presented in section V. Results for learning estimates of all future state qualities for incomplete state information is presented in section VI. Section VII discusses the potential of the ESN for use in reinforcement learning and provides current and future directions of research.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556402","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning","Recurrent neural networks","Neural networks","Computer science","Feedforward systems","Control systems","Feedforward neural networks","Electronic mail","Computer architecture","Fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","feedforward neural nets","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Q-function","linear dynamical system","mass-spring-damper","time-delayed neural network","feed forward neural network","reinforcement learning","echo state network architecture"]}],"publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33093/01556402.pdf","startPage":"2995","endPage":"3000 vol. 5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556402","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling reward functions for incomplete state representations via echo state networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556402/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling reward functions for incomplete state representations via echo state networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8774080","htmlLink":"/document/1556402/","volume":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling reward functions for incomplete state representations via echo state networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051272S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"33093","articleId":"1556402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556404,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

As part of human aging, declines in all three postural control systems occur. Age-related changes impact multiple gait parameters, such as decreased range of motion in plantarflexion, increased hip flexion, and reduced stride length and gait velocity. In addition, excessive weight bearing on the heels during standing or forefoot-dominated walking creates risk factors for falls and injury within this population. Identification of these abnormal patterns by a computerized technique can help in early detection of gait changes and prevention of falls. This paper presents a case study to see if plantar pressure and heel acceleration patterns attributed to different motion activities can be accurately identified by a neural network classifier. The method has been tested on motion patterns collected from a single subject. The results show good sensitivity and specificity of the classifier, confirming the feasibility of further research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556404/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8774082","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1556404/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of plantar pressure and heel acceleration patterns using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of plantar pressure and heel acceleration patterns using neural networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06222S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33093","articleId":"1556404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556406,"authors":[{"name":"McMahon EM","affiliation":["Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA"],"lastName":"McMahon EM","id":"37087487865"},{"name":"J.

We hypothesize that the entire strain waveform over one heart cycle can be classified to functionally determine whether or not a myocardial region is perfused.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556406","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33093/01556406.pdf","startPage":"3017","endPage":"3022 vol. 5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network and principal component analyses of highly variable myocardial mechanical waveforms derived from echocardiographic ultrasound images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","displayDocTitle":"Neural network and principal component analyses of highly variable myocardial mechanical waveforms derived from echocardiographic ultrasound images","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8774084","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556406/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network and principal component analyses of highly variable myocardial mechanical waveforms derived from echocardiographic ultrasound images","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104186S","chronDate":"July 31 2005-Aug. 4 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","xplore-issue":"33093","articleId":"1556406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1556411,"authors":[{"name":"L.I.

A critical example of such a situation is seen in face recognition, where many technologies are already intensively used for passport verification and where there is no technology that can reliably identify a person from a surveillance video. The reason for this is that video provides images of much lower quality and resolution than that of photographs. Besides, objects in video are normally captured in unconstrained environments, often under poor lighting, in motion and at a distance. This makes memorization of an object from a single video frame unreliable and recognition based on a single video frame very difficult if even possible. This paper introduces a neuro-associative approach to recognition which can both learn and identify an object from low-resolution low-quality video sequences. This approach is derived from a mathematical model of biological visual memory, in which correlation-based projection learning is used to memorize a face from a video sequence and attractor-based association is performed to recognize a face over several video frames. The approach is demonstrated using a video-based facial database and real-time video annotation of TV shows.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556419/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8774097","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1556419/","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Associative neural networks as means for low-resolution video-based recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Associative neural networks as means for low-resolution video-based recognition","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103989S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33093","articleId":"1556419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1556425,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Integration of planar patch-clamp technology into this platform to create a novel long-term interface is presented, with the formation of a high resistance (giga-ohm) electrical seal between the cultured cell membrane and the perimeter of a micron-sized orifice integrated into the substrate. This platform has potential as a tool to investigate mechanisms underlying neuro-genesis, synaptic transmission, and neuro-degeneration.

In order to reduce the training time, we propose principal component analysis as a dimension reduction technique. We used an MLP with LM learning algorithm and a RBF neural network (RBFNN) with K-means algorithm to cluster the data. Both the ANNs are used in a neural adaptive line enhancer (NALE) configuration.

GETnet is a step towards the realization of general intelligent systems that can be applied to a broad range of problems. GETnet utilizes nonlinear moving average and autoregressive nodes and sub-circuits that are trained by enhanced gradient descent and evolutionary search in architecture, synaptic delay, and synaptic weight spaces. The ability to evolve arbitrary time-delay connections enables GETnet to find novel answers to classification and system identification tasks. A new temporal minimum description length policy ensures creation of fast and compact networks with improved generalization capabilities.

In this algorithm, each document as well as each cluster mean is represented as a high-dimensional unit-length vector. However, it has been mainly used in hatch mode. Thus is, each cluster mean vector is updated, only after all document vectors being assigned, as the (normalized) average of all the document vectors assigned to that cluster. This paper investigates an online version of the spherical k-means algorithm based on the well-known winner-take-all competitive learning. In this online algorithm, each cluster centroid is incrementally updated given a document. We demonstrate that the online spherical k-means algorithm can achieve significantly better clustering results than the batch version, especially when an annealing-type learning rate schedule is used.

The voltage-controlled linear conductance produces the synaptic function of multiplication, weight programming, and summation of synaptic spike currents for the neuron. The operation speed of synaptic computation is up to 300 Mega operations with a small power consumption of 33 microwatts. The overall power consumption can be less in real applications, as individual synapse only consumes the power when there is an active neural input. The neuron is based on multiple combinations of synapses and the HSPICE simulation demonstrates the asynchronous spike behavior of integration-and-firing with a refractory period. The advantages of asynchronous operation, removal of reference clocks, and low voltage operation are exhibited compared to previous pulse-based analogue-mixed neural networks VLSI. The asynchronous spike based neural networks in 0.18/spl mu/m CMOS VLSI technology is proposed to provide the advantage of analogue-mixed neural network VLSI with small power consumption and no need for a synchronous operation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biologically plausible VLSI neural network implementation with asynchronous neuron and spike-based synapse","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556447","endPage":"3248 vol. 5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33093/01556447.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","startPage":"3244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556447","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Neural networks","Neurons","Energy consumption","CMOS technology","Voltage","Functional programming","Linear programming","Biology computing","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","neural chips","asynchronous circuits","power consumption","SPICE","CMOS integrated circuits","bioelectric phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous neuron","spike-based synapse","asynchronous spike","voltage-controlled linear conductance","power consumption","HSPICE simulation","reference clock","low voltage operation","CMOS","analogue-mixed neural network","VLSI","33 mW","0.18 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Biologically plausible VLSI neural network implementation with asynchronous neuron and spike-based synapse","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/1556447/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8774125","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biologically plausible VLSI neural network implementation with asynchronous neuron and spike-based synapse","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064563S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33093","articleId":"1556447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1556449,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The motion estimation is based on a strongly localized bio-inspired connectionist model with a particular adaptation of spatio-temporal Gabor-like filtering, commonly used for early visual perception. The architecture is constituted by three main modules that perform three different kinds of processing: spatial, temporal, and excitatory-inhibitory connectionist processing. The architecture is modeled, simulated and validated in VHDL. Synthesis results of the spatial and temporal processing modules of the bio-inspired model on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device are presented to validate the architecture.

These nodes interact through parametric coupling, self organize, and the network evolves to spatio-temporal attractors that encode stored patterns. This strategy is used to implement associative memories in which the coding of binary strings is done through period-2 cycles. The performance of such associative arrangements is measured through the average error in pattern recovery. The impact of the synaptic connections magnitude on architecture performance is analyzed, and a strategy for minimizing pattern recovery degradation when the number of stored patterns increases is developed. Experimental results show the success of such strategy. Mechanisms for allowing the studied networks to deal with asynchronous changes in input patterns, and tools for the interconnection between associative assemblies and hetero-association are developed. Finally, the coupling and coding of information in heterogeneous assemblies with diverse recursive maps are analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556458","pdfPath":"/iel5/10421/33093/01556458.pdf","startPage":"3306","endPage":"3310 vol. 5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-homogenous structures in neural networks with chaotic recursive nodes: dealing with diverse multi-assemblies architectures, connectivity and arbitrary bifurcating nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Non-homogenous structures in neural networks with chaotic recursive nodes: dealing with diverse multi-assemblies architectures, connectivity and arbitrary bifurcating nodes","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8774136","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556458/","conferenceDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-homogenous structures in neural networks with chaotic recursive nodes: dealing with diverse multi-assemblies architectures, connectivity and arbitrary bifurcating nodes","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076507S","chronDate":"31 July-4 Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10421","isNumber":"33093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10421","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33093","articleId":"1556458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1556462,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan"],"lastName":"Yong Liu","id":"37087154766"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9048-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"}],"articleNumber":"1556462","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":41},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Boosting","Computer science","Electronic mail","Learning systems","Bagging","Testing","Decorrelation","Filtering algorithms","Process design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","negative correlation learning","penalty function","classification task"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556462","abstract":"Two penalty functions are introduced in the negative correlation learning for finding different neural networks in an ensemble.

The goal is to help developers avoid making these mistakes and more readily identify security problems whenever possible. Because developers today are by and large unaware of the security problems they can (unknowingly) introduce into code, a taxonomy of coding errors should provide a real tangible benefit to the software security community. Although the taxonomy proposed here is incomplete and imperfect, it provides an important first step. It focuses on collecting common errors and explaining them in a way that makes sense to programmers. This new taxonomy is made up of two distinct kinds of sets, which we're stealing from biology: a phylum (a type of coding error, such as illegal pointer value) and a kingdom (a collection of phyla that shares a common theme, such as input validation and representation). Both kingdoms and phyla naturally emerge from a soup of coding rules relevant to enterprise software, and it's for this reason that this taxonomy is likely to be incomplete and might lack certain coding errors. In some cases, it's easier and more effective to talk about a category of errors than to talk about any particular attack. Although categories are certainly related to attacks, they aren't the same as attack patterns.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Security & Privacy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Security & Privacy","pdfPath":"/iel5/8013/33104/01556543.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seven pernicious kingdoms: a taxonomy of software security errors","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2005.159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2005.159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Seven pernicious kingdoms: a taxonomy of software security errors","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8721032","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1556543/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seven pernicious kingdoms: a taxonomy of software security errors","sourcePdf":"01556543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035163S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"8013","isNumber":"33104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8013","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"33104","articleId":"1556543","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556555,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The effect of the amplifier and measurement system dynamics on the feedback linearization performance, was also examined, and compensation filters were developed. Finally, an uncertainty framework was proposed for the linearized plant, and a robust controller was designed via /spl mu/ synthesis.

The axial type motor, which is basically composed of a disc motor and an axial magnetic bearing, controls both the rotation and the axial translation of the rotor. The proposed motor is similar to the bidirectional disc motor, except for changing the magnitudes of both sides of the flux to control the axial attractive force. However, the radial and tilt directions rely on passive stability, and, therefore, the rotor has poor damping which might cause damage to blood constituents. The design includes a hydrodynamic bearing for improving radial support properties. Finally, to confirm its functionality, an experimental prototype of the proposed motor has been constructed and incorporated into a mixed flow blood pump. The results indicated that the bidirectional axial-type self-bearing motor had high efficiency as a small continuous flow blood pump, delivering sufficient flow rate and pressure head.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed flow artificial heart pump with axial self-bearing motor","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2005.859827","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/33106/01556569.pdf","startPage":"658","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2005.859827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33106","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556569/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Mixed flow artificial heart pump with axial self-bearing motor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1556569/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8693149","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed flow artificial heart pump with axial self-bearing motor","sourcePdf":"01556569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071864S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"33106","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"33106","articleId":"1556569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556580,"authors":[{"name":"Euntai Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/33107/1556580/1556580-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Euntai Kim (S'96\u2013M'00) was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1970.

In this paper, a new multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) fuzzy disturbance observer (FDO) based on output measurement is developed to achieve the goal. A filtered signal is introduced to resolve the algebraic loop encountered in the conventional FDO. The contribution of the disturbance observation error /spl zeta/ to updating the parameters of the fuzzy system is analyzed in the sense of L/sub 2/ and L/sub /spl infin//. Then, the MIMO FDO is modified and the high gain observer (HGO) is employed to implement the output tracking control system. It is shown in a rigorous manner that the disturbance observation error, the tracking error and the state observation error converge to a compact set of which size can be kept arbitrarily small. Finally, the suggested method is applied to the speed control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) in the presence of the internal parameter uncertainty and external disturbance. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the suggested method are demonstrated by computer simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/33107/01556580.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output feedback tracking control of MIMO systems using a fuzzy disturbance observer and its application to the speed control of a PM synchronous motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","Control systems","MIMO","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Velocity control","Synchronous motors","Uncertain systems","Signal resolution","Permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","MIMO systems","observers","angular velocity control","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors","machine control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output feedback tracking control","MIMO systems","fuzzy disturbance observer","speed control","permanent magnet synchronous motors","control system design","multiple-input-multiple-output system","disturbance observation error","high gain observer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["filtered signal","fuzzy disturbance observer","high gain observer","MIMO","PM synchronous motor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Output feedback tracking control of MIMO systems using a fuzzy disturbance observer and its application to the speed control of a PM synchronous motor","volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1556580/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8701277","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output feedback tracking control of MIMO systems using a fuzzy disturbance observer and its application to the speed control of a PM synchronous motor","sourcePdf":"01556580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161629S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"33107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"33107","articleId":"1556580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556583,"authors":[{"name":"W.-J.

The considered large-scale system comprises of a number of subsystems and each subsystem is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The interconnection between any two subsystems may be nonlinear and satisfies some matching condition. By the concept of parallel distributed compensation (PDC), the decentralized fuzzy control for each subsystem is synthesized, in which the control gain depends on the strength of interconnections, maximal number of the fired rules in each subsystem, and the common positive matrix P/sub i/. Based on Lyapunov criterion and Riccati-inequality, some sufficient conditions are derived and the common P/sub i/ is solved by linear matrix inequalities (LMI) so that the whole closed loop large-scale fuzzy system with the synthesized fuzzy control is asymptotically stable. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the control synthesis and its effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/33107/01556583.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33107","startPage":"779","endPage":"786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized PDC for large-scale T-S fuzzy systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556583","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized PDC for large-scale T-S fuzzy systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556583/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8701280","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556583/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized PDC for large-scale T-S fuzzy systems","sourcePdf":"01556583.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065057S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"33107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"33107","articleId":"1556583","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556584,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/33107/1556584/1556584-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chong Lin received the B.Sci. and M.Sci. degrees in applied mathematics from Northeastern University, P.

In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy support vector machine to discriminate good creditors from bad ones. Because in credit scoring areas we usually cannot label one customer as absolutely good who is sure to repay in time, or absolutely bad who will default certainly, our new fuzzy support vector machine treats every sample as both positive and negative classes, but with different memberships. By this way we expect the new fuzzy support vector machine to have more generalization ability, while preserving the merit of insensitive to outliers, as the fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) proposed in previous papers. We reformulate this kind of two-group classification problem into a quadratic programming problem. Empirical tests on three public datasets show that it can have better discriminatory power than the standard support vector machine and the fuzzy support vector machine if appropriate kernel and membership generation method are chosen.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new fuzzy support vector machine to evaluate credit risk","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859320","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/33107/01556587.pdf","startPage":"820","endPage":"831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.859320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556587","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556587/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A new fuzzy support vector machine to evaluate credit risk","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/1556587/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8701284","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new fuzzy support vector machine to evaluate credit risk","sourcePdf":"01556587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084744S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"33107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"226","xplore-issue":"33107","articleId":"1556587","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1556588,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University of China, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/33107/1556588/1556588-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bing Chen received the B.A. degree in mathematics from Liaoning University, P.

The basis for the control was a synergistic model of reaching and grasping that uses temporal and spatial synergies between the arm and body segments. The synergies were determined from the movement data measured in nondisabled persons during the performance of functional tasks. The work space was divided into six zones: distance (two attributes) and laterality (three attributes). Radial basis function artificial neural networks (RBF ANN) were used to determine synergies. Sets of RBF ANN characterized with good generalization were selected as control laws for elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination. The validation was performed for three categories: inter-subject, distance, and laterality generalization. For all of the defined spatial synergies, the correlation was high for inter-subject and distance, yet low for the laterality scenario. This suggests the necessity for implementing different maps for different directions, but the same maps for different distances. The natural movements of the upper arm then drive the lower arm (elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination) in a way that is very well suited for the administration of functional electrical therapy (FET) in persons with hemiplegia soon after the onset of impairment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8695474","pubMedId":"16425830","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/1556605/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic determination of synergies by radial basis function artificial neural networks for the control of a neural prosthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic determination of synergies by radial basis function artificial neural networks for the control of a neural prosthesis","sourcePdf":"01556605.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077124S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"33108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"33108","articleId":"1556605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1556610,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Long-term array reliability is an important requirement for these applications. Here, we demonstrate the reliability of a regular array of 100 microelectrodes to obtain neural recordings from primary motor cortex (MI) of monkeys for at least three months and up to 1.5 years. We implanted Bionic (Cyberkinetics, Inc., Foxboro, MA) silicon probe arrays in MI of three Macaque monkeys. Neural signals were recorded during performance of an eight-direction, push-button task. Recording reliability was evaluated for 18, 35, or 51 sessions distributed over 83, 179, and 569 days after implantation, respectively, using qualitative and quantitative measures. A four-point signal quality scale was defined based on the waveform amplitude relative to noise. A single observer applied this scale to score signal quality for each electrode. A mean of 120 (/spl plusmn/17.6 SD), 146 (/spl plusmn/7.3), and 119 (/spl plusmn/16.9) neural-like waveforms were observed from 65-85 electrodes across subjects for all recording sessions of which over 80% were of high quality. Quantitative measures demonstrated that waveforms had signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to 20 with maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of over 1200 /spl mu/v with a mean SNR of 4.8 for signals ranked as high quality. Mean signal quality did not change over the duration of the evaluation period (slope 0.001, 0.0068 and 0.03; NS). By contrast, neural waveform shape varied between, but not within days in all animals, suggesting a shifting population of recorded neurons over time. Arm-movement related modulation was common and 66% of all recorded neurons were tuned to reach direction. The ability for the array to record neural signals from parietal cortex was also established. These results demonstrate that neural recordings that can provide movement related signals for neural prostheses, as well as for fundamental research applications, can be reliably obtained for long time periods using a monolithic microelectrode array in primate MI and potentially from other cortical areas as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556610/","accessionNumber":"8695479","pubMedId":"16425835","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of signals from a chronically implanted, silicon-based electrode array in non-human primate primary motor cortex","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of signals from a chronically implanted, silicon-based electrode array in non-human primate primary motor cortex","sourcePdf":"01556610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083664S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"33108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"281","xplore-issue":"33108","articleId":"1556610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1556613,"authors":[{"name":"P.D.

The success of such a system depends on two properties of the representation. First, the coding rate is minimized only if the elements of the representation are statistically independent. Second, the perceived coding distortion is minimized only if the errors in a reconstructed image arising from quantization of the different elements of the representation are perceptually independent. We argue that linear transforms cannot achieve either of these goals and propose, instead, an adaptive nonlinear image representation in which each coefficient of a linear transform is divided by a weighted sum of coefficient amplitudes in a generalized neighborhood. We then show that the divisive operation greatly reduces both the statistical and the perceptual redundancy amongst representation elements. We develop an efficient method of inverting this transformation, and we demonstrate through simulations that the dual reduction in dependency can greatly improve the visual quality of compressed images.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.860325","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33109/01556625.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.860325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"68","endPage":"80","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear image representation for efficient perceptual coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear image representation for efficient perceptual coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556625/","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1556625/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8700064","pubMedId":"16435537","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear image representation for efficient perceptual coding","sourcePdf":"01556625.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097963S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"33109","articleId":"1556625","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556629,"authors":[{"name":"O.N.

This so-called automultiscopic display can deliver multiple views without glasses, thus allowing a limited \"look-around\" (correct motion-parallax). Central to this technology is the process of multiplexing several views into a single viewable image. This multiplexing is a complex process involving irregular subsampling of the original views. If not preceded by low-pass filtering, it results in aliasing that leads to texture as well as depth distortions. In order to eliminate this aliasing, we propose to model the multiplexing process with lattices, find their parameters and then design optimal anti-alias filters. To this effect, we use multidimensional sampling theory and basic optimization tools. We derive optimal anti-alias filters for a specific automultiscopic monitor using three models: the orthogonal lattice, the nonorthogonal lattice, and the union of shifted lattices. In the first case, the resulting separable low-pass filter offers significant aliasing reduction that is further improved by hexagonal-passband low-pass filter for the nonorthogonal lattice model. A more accurate model is obtained using union of shifted lattices, but due to the complex nature of repeated spectra, practical filters designed in this case offer no additional improvement. We also describe a practical method to design finite-precision, low-complexity filters that can be implemented using modern graphics cards.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2005.860339","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/33109/01556632.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"140","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2005.860339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subsampling models and anti-alias filters for 3-D automultiscopic displays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Subsampling models and anti-alias filters for 3-D automultiscopic displays","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/1556632/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","accessionNumber":"8700071","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","pubMedId":"16435544","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556632/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subsampling models and anti-alias filters for 3-D automultiscopic displays","sourcePdf":"01556632.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063297S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"33109","articleId":"1556632","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1556633,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A closer look at these problems reveals the relation between them, and, as conventional color digital cameras suffer from both low-spatial resolution and color-filtering, it is reasonable to address them in a unified context. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust hybrid method of super-resolution and demosaicing, based on a maximum a posteriori estimation technique by minimizing a multiterm cost function. The L/sub 1/ norm is used for measuring the difference between the projected estimate of the high-resolution image and each low-resolution image, removing outliers in the data and errors due to possibly inaccurate motion estimation. Bilateral regularization is used for spatially regularizing the luminance component, resulting in sharp edges and forcing interpolation along the edges and not across them. Simultaneously, Tikhonov regularization is used to smooth the chrominance components. Finally, an additional regularization term is used to force similar edge location and orientation in different color channels. We show that the minimization of the total cost function is relatively easy and fast. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets confirm the effectiveness of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556633/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1556633/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8700072","pubMedId":"16435545","volume":"15","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiframe demosaicing and super-resolution of color images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiframe demosaicing and super-resolution of color images","sourcePdf":"01556633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107896S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"33109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"33109","articleId":"1556633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556638,"authors":[{"name":"N.A.

The assignable energy functions are characterized by a set of partial differential equations that must be solved to determine the control law. We prove in this paper that for a class of mechanical systems with underactuation degree one the partial differential equations can be explicitly solved. Furthermore, we introduce a suitable parametrization of assignable energy functions that provides the designer with a handle to address transient performance and robustness issues. Finally, we develop a speed estimator that allows the implementation of position-feedback controllers. The new result is applied to obtain an (almost) globally stabilizing scheme for the vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with strong input coupling, and a controller for the pendulum in a cart that can swing-up the pendulum from any position in the upper half plane and stop the cart at any desired location. In both cases we obtain very simple and intuitive position-feedback solutions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2005.860292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/33113/01556727.pdf","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1955","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2005.860292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control of mechanical systems with underactuation degree one","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control of mechanical systems with underactuation degree one","volume":"50","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556727/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8695542","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556727/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control of mechanical systems with underactuation degree one","sourcePdf":"01556727.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100093S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"33113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"33113","articleId":"1556727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1556730,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We formulate this problem as one of minimizing the closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to constraints on the controller structure. We define the notion of quadratic invariance of a constraint set with respect to a system, and show that if the constraint set has this property, then the constrained minimum-norm problem may be solved via convex programming. We also show that quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the constraint set to be preserved under feedback. These results are developed in a very general framework, and are shown to hold in both continuous and discrete time, for both stable and unstable systems, and for any norm. This notion unifies many previous results identifying specific tractable decentralized control problems, and delineates the largest known class of convex problems in decentralized control. As an example, we show that optimal stabilizing controllers may be efficiently computed in the case where distributed controllers can communicate faster than their dynamics propagate. We also show that symmetric synthesis is included in this classification, and provide a test for sparsity constraints to be quadratically invariant, and thus amenable to convex synthesis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556730/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","volume":"50","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"8695545","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1556730/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A characterization of convex problems in decentralized control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A characterization of convex problems in decentralized control","sourcePdf":"01556730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.20282S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"33113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"446","xplore-issue":"33113","articleId":"1556730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556739,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung-Jinn Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Kyung-Jinn Yang","id":"37277422800"},{"name":"Keum-Shik Hong","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Pusan National University, Busan, South Korea"],"lastName":"Keum-Shik Hong","id":"37276196300"},{"name":"F.

The radio interface is a major challenge, since its power consumption must be reduced below 100 /spl mu/W (energy scavenging limit). The emerging ultra-wide-band (UWB) technology shows strong advantages in reaching this target. First, most of the complexity of an UWB system is in the receiver, which is a perfect scenario in the WBAN context. Second, the very little hardware complexity of a UWB transmitter offers the potential for low-cost and highly integrated solutions. Finally, in a pulse-based UWB scheme, the transmitter can be duty-cycled at the pulse rate, thereby reducing the baseline power consumption. We present a low-power UWB transmitter that can be fully integrated in standard CMOS technology. Measured performances of a fully integrated pulse generator are provided, showing the potential of UWB for low power and low cost implementations. Finally, using a WBAN channel model, we present a comparison between our UWB solution and state-of-the-art low-power narrow-band implementations. This paper shows that UWB performs better in the short range due to a reduced baseline power consumption.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra-wide-band transmitter for low-power wireless body area networks: design and evaluation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.858187","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33114/01556760.pdf","startPage":"2515","endPage":"2525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.858187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-wide-band transmitter for low-power wireless body area networks: design and evaluation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556760/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686587","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-wide-band transmitter for low-power wireless body area networks: design and evaluation","sourcePdf":"01556760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069119S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556761,"authors":[{"name":"Shuenn-Yuh Lee","affiliation":["Communication and Biologic Integrated Circuit Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/33114/1556761/1556761-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuenn-Yuh Lee (M'98) was born in Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1966.

In this paper, we present a fully integrated binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) demodulator, which is based on a hard-limited COSTAS loop topology, dedicated to such implantable medical devices. The experimental results of the proposed demodulator show a data transmission rate of 1.12 Mbps, less than 0.7 mW consumption under a supply voltage of 1.8 V, and silicon area of 0.2 mm/sup 2/ in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) CMOS 0.18-/spl mu/m technology. The transmitter satisfies the requirement of applications relative to high forward-transferring data rate, such as cortical stimulation. Moreover, the employment of BPSK demodulation along with a passive modulation method allows full-duplex data communication between an external controller and the implantable device, which may improve the controllability and observability of the overall implanted system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33114/01556763.pdf","startPage":"2552","endPage":"2562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.858163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.858163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully integrated low-power BPSK demodulator for implantable medical devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary phase shift keying","Demodulation","Implantable biomedical devices","Data communication","CMOS technology","Implants","Wireless communication","Phase shift keying","Circuit topology","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shift keying","demodulators","prosthetics","biomedical electronics","biomedical telemetry","CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully integrated low-power BPSK demodulator","implantable medical devices","biomedical implantable electronic devices","binary phase-shift keying demodulator","hard-limited COSTAS loop topology","CMOS technology","data transfer","passive modulation method","full-duplex data communication","1.12 Mbit/s","0.18 micron","1.8 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) demodulator","biotelemetry","COSTAS loop","electronic implant","inductive link","wireless data transmitter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"A fully integrated low-power BPSK demodulator for implantable medical devices","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556763/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686590","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully integrated low-power BPSK demodulator for implantable medical devices","sourcePdf":"01556763.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074845S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556764,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The demonstrated microbeamformer has four input channels and four delays, though the concept can easily be extended to any desirable configuration. The log domain, Class-AB architecture is perfect for medical ultrasound applications due to the fact that the received ultrasound signal has very low amplitude during the major part of the reception period. This leads to very low power consumption because of the Class-AB configuration. The delay-line in the microbeamformer is constructed using a cascade of low input impedance allpass filter cells. A simple implementation of the zero in the allpass filter helps to keep the overall power consumption low. The delay of each allpass filter cell is programmable through the adjustment of a tuning current. Due to the Class-AB architecture used, every source signal must be shaped by a signal preconditioning circuit before connected to the filter cells. A well-known preconditioning circuit has been modified to increase the dynamic range. The modification introduces noise cancellation as well as a method to increases the maximum signal swing. The dynamic range of one preconditioning cell is shown to increase 12.6 dB compared to the classic translinear circuit at a penalty of 15% increase in the power consumption. Signal-to-noise ratio of one allpass filter cell is typically 56.5 dB, and the global dynamic range of the same cell is typically 63.8 dB at an average power consumption of 3.5 mW when 16 input signals are connected to the filter. The power consumption at maximum signal amplitude for the microbeamformer having four input channels and four delays is 3.2 mW with a supply voltage of 2.5 V. In the intended application, the quiescent power consumption is a much better description of the average power consumption. This power consumption is 1.3 mW.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.857544","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33114/01556764.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.857544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","startPage":"2563","endPage":"2575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A log-domain /spl mu/beamformer for medical ultrasound imaging systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"A log-domain /spl mu/beamformer for medical ultrasound imaging systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556764/","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556764/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686591","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A log-domain /spl mu/beamformer for medical ultrasound imaging systems","sourcePdf":"01556764.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110005S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556764","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556765,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The circuit has been designed with optimization of key performances, such as bandwidth, noise, and offset voltage. There have also been precautions taken against potential effect of strong magnetic field under which the circuit should operate. The designed preamplifier has a voltage gain of 15 dB and a bandwidth of 100 MHz. After fabrication of the circuit, we have carried out testing work, including in-field circuit test and characterization of MOS transistors. Under 2-T magnetic field, there have not been substantial changes in overall circuit performances compared to results obtained by post-layout simulations. For an experiment of NMR measurements with and without in-field preamplifier, the circuit is coupled with a receiver micro-coil. The experiment has been to detect protons at 85.13-MHz resonance frequency under 2-T magnetic field with water sample. The obtained results have shown a 14-dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement when the preamplifier is associated with the receiver coil.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33114/01556765.pdf","startPage":"2576","endPage":"2583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.857870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.857870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS microcoil-associated preamplifier for NMR spectroscopy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Preamplifiers","Nuclear magnetic resonance","Spectroscopy","Circuit testing","Magnetic field measurement","Bandwidth","Voltage","Magnetic circuits","Nuclear measurements","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preamplifiers","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","NMR spectroscopy","current conveyors","impedance matching","circuit optimisation","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS microcoil-associated preamplifier","NMR spectroscopy","nuclear magnetic resonance measurements","CMOS process","second-generation positive current conveyor","impedance matching","circuit optimization","integrated circuit testing","in-field circuit","MOS transistor characterization","receiver micro-coil","85.13 MHz","15 dB","2 T"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current conveyor","in-field preamplifier","nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) active probe","receiver micro-coil"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS microcoil-associated preamplifier for NMR spectroscopy","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556765/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686592","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS microcoil-associated preamplifier for NMR spectroscopy","sourcePdf":"01556765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098582S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556767,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The nonoverlapping of these two phases is essential for successful SC operation since, a capacitor inside an SC circuit can discharge if two switches, driven by /spl phi//sub 1/ and /spl phi//sub 2/, are turned on simultaneously. Moreover, since 1983, two additional phases are generally used in many SC circuits, which consist of advanced versions of /spl phi//sub 1/ and /spl phi//sub 2/. These two additional phases overcome the problem of signal-dependent charge injection. This paper presents a low-power and low-voltage analog-to-digital (A/D) interface module for biomedical applications. This module provides an A/D conversion based on a mixed clock-boosting/switched-opamp (CB/SO) second-order sigma-delta (/spl Sigma//spl Delta/) modulator, capable of interfacing with several different types electrical signals existing in the human body, only by re-programming the output digital filter. The proposed /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ architecture employs a novel single-phase scheme technique, which improves the dynamic performance and highly reduces the clocking circuitry complexity, substrate noise and area. Simulated results demonstrate that the signal integrity can be preserved by exploring the gap between the high conductance region of pMOS and nMOS switches at low power-supply voltages and the fast clock transitions that exist in advanced CMOS technologies. The mixed CB/SO architecture together with the overall distortion reduction resulting from using the proposed single-phase scheme, result that the dynamic range of the modulator is pushed closer to the theoretical limit of an ideal second-order /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ modulator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.857552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33114/01556767.pdf","startPage":"2595","endPage":"2604","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.857552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power low-voltage CMOS A/D sigma-delta modulator for bio-potential signals driven by a single-phase scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Low-power low-voltage CMOS A/D sigma-delta modulator for bio-potential signals driven by a single-phase scheme","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556767/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686594","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556767/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power low-voltage CMOS A/D sigma-delta modulator for bio-potential signals driven by a single-phase scheme","sourcePdf":"01556767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057043S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1556768,"authors":[{"name":"C.

While initial clinical experiments using retinal prosthesis have resulted in visual perception in humans, psychophysical tests and simulations suggest that a high-density retinal prosthesis is required to restore vision to a level of reading and mobility. In the implanted prosthetic device, the microstimulator is functionally the closest to the tissue, delivering the electrical stimulation. Choosing the suitable architecture of the microstimulator requires the knowledge of the available choices and the tradeoffs associated with each of them. This paper presents the different architectures of microstimulator for high-density retinal prosthesis considering both the biomedical and circuit perspectives. The choices for the key aspects of the microstimulator-location of the chip in the eye, electrode configuration, method of stimulation, demultiplexing, stimulation sequence, and communication protocol-are discussed along with the associated tradeoffs for each of them. One of the architectures is used in a prototype microstimulator for an implantable epi-retinal prosthetic device to be used in clinical trials. The chip consists of 60 independently programmable output drivers for delivering electrical stimulus and digital controller for managing run-time and configuration data. The circuit details of the chip fabricated in 1.2-/spl mu/m CMOS technology and its measurement results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.857554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33114/01556771.pdf","startPage":"2629","endPage":"2641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.857554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architecture tradeoffs in high-density microstimulators for retinal prosthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556771","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556771/","displayDocTitle":"Architecture tradeoffs in high-density microstimulators for retinal prosthesis","volume":"52","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686598","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1556771/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture tradeoffs in high-density microstimulators for retinal prosthesis","sourcePdf":"01556771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089936S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556772,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This visual neuroprosthesis performs intracortical microstimulation through one or more arrays of microelectrodes implanted into the primary visual cortex. The whole system is composed by a primary unit located outside the body and a secondary unit, implanted inside the body. The primary unit comprises a neuromorphic encoder, a forward transmitter, and a backward receiver. The developed neuromorphic encoder generates the spikes to stimulate the cortex by approximating the spatio-temporal receptive fields characteristic response of ganglion cells. Power and stimuli information are carried to inside the cranium by means of a low-coupling transformer, which establishes a wireless inductive link between the two units. The secondary unit comprises a forward receiver, microelectrode stimulation circuitry and a backward transmitter that is used to monitor the implant. Address event representation is used for communicating spike events. Data is modulated with binary frequency-shift keying and differential binary phase-shift keying in the forward and in the backward directions, respectively. A prototype of the proposed system was developed and tested. Experimental results show that the spikes to stimulate the visual cortex are accurately generated and that the efficiency of the inductive link is relatively high, about 28% in average for 1 cm intercoil distance providing a power of about 50 milliwatts to the secondary implanted unit. Application specific integrated circuits were designed for this secondary unit, showing that, with current technology, it is possible to implement such a unit, respecting the power constraints.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.857923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33114","startPage":"2648","endPage":"2662","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33114/01556773.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual neuroprosthesis: a non invasive system for stimulating the cortex","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556773/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Visual neuroprosthesis: a non invasive system for stimulating the cortex","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686600","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual neuroprosthesis: a non invasive system for stimulating the cortex","sourcePdf":"01556773.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128888S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556774,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The proposed front-end preamplifier is composed of a photodetector, a transimpedance preamplifier, a two-stage voltage amplifier and a mixer. Strict constraints regarding noise thus have to be considered. The preamplifier consists of a transimpedance block featuring a 95-dB/spl Omega/ gain and an average input current noise density at the frequency of interest of approximately 3 pA//spl radic/Hz. Each of the two subsequent voltage amplifiers allows the user to obtain an additional 25-dB gain. Considering the tuning capabilities and the losses due to the filters and the nonideal buffers, the proposed front-end allows us to obtain a total gain up to 145 dB. The back-end of the amplification chain is composed of a mixer which is used to produce a continuous voltage proportional to the amplitude of the input optical signals. All those features were integrated using CMOS 0.18-/spl mu/m technology and the experimental results are in agreement with the initial design requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556774/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686601","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A new integrated front-end for a noninvasive brain imaging system based on near-infrared spectroreflectometry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new integrated front-end for a noninvasive brain imaging system based on near-infrared spectroreflectometry","sourcePdf":"01556774.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058793S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1556776,"authors":[{"name":"J.N.

Significant power savings are achieved by introducing a second operation mode that shuts down 2/3 of the hardware for long time periods when the pacemaker patient is not exposed to noise, while not degrading performance. Due to a 0.13-/spl mu/m CMOS technology and the low clock frequency of 1 kHz, leakage power becomes the dominating power source. By introducing sleep transistors in the power-supply rails, leakage power of the hardware being shut off is reduced by 97%. Power estimation on RTL-level shows that the overall power consumption is reduced by 67% with a dual operation mode. Under these conditions, the detector is expected to operate in the sub-/spl mu/W region. Detection performance is evaluated by means of databases containing electrograms to which five types of exogenic and endogenic interferences are added. The results show that reliable detection is obtained at moderate and low signal to noise-ratios (SNRs). Average detection performance in terms of detected events and false alarms for 25-dB SNR is P/sub D/=0.98 and P/sub FA/=0.014, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.857925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33114/01556776.pdf","startPage":"2686","endPage":"2698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.857925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital implementation of a wavelet-based event detector for cardiac pacemakers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556776/","displayDocTitle":"Digital implementation of a wavelet-based event detector for cardiac pacemakers","volume":"52","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686603","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1556776/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital implementation of a wavelet-based event detector for cardiac pacemakers","sourcePdf":"01556776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103428S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1556780,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering/Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/33114/1556780/1556780-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin-Teng (CT) Lin (F'05) received the B.S. degree from National Chiao-Tung University (NCTU), Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, R.O.C. in 1986 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 1992.","He is currently the Chair Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dean of Computer Science College, and Director of Brain Research Center, NCTU.

It requires an optimal technique to continuously detect drivers' cognitive state related to abilities in perception, recognition, and vehicle control in (near-) real-time. The major challenges in developing such a system include: 1) the lack of significant index for detecting drowsiness and 2) complicated and pervasive noise interferences in a realistic and dynamic driving environment. In this paper, we develop a drowsiness-estimation system based on electroencephalogram (EEG) by combining independent component analysis (ICA), power-spectrum analysis, correlation evaluations, and linear regression model to estimate a driver's cognitive state when he/she drives a car in a virtual reality (VR)-based dynamic simulator. The driving error is defined as deviations between the center of the vehicle and the center of the cruising lane in the lane-keeping driving task. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of quantitatively estimating drowsiness level using ICA-based multistream EEG spectra. The proposed ICA-based method applied to power spectrum of ICA components can successfully (1) remove most of EEG artifacts, (2) suggest an optimal montage to place EEG electrodes, and estimate the driver's drowsiness fluctuation indexed by the driving performance measure. Finally, we present a benchmark study in which the accuracy of ICA-component-based alertness estimates compares favorably to scalp-EEG based.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.857555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/33114/01556780.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.857555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33114","startPage":"2726","endPage":"2738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG-based drowsiness estimation for safety driving using independent component analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EEG-based drowsiness estimation for safety driving using independent component analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686607","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556780/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG-based drowsiness estimation for safety driving using independent component analysis","sourcePdf":"01556780.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138704S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"269","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":1556782,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Lian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/33114/1556782/1556782-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Lian (M'90\u2013SM'99) received the B.Sc degree from the School of Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1984, and the Ph.D degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 1994.","He was with the Institute of Microcomputer Research, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Brighten Information Technology Ltd., Shanghai, China, SyQuest Technology International, Singapore, and Xyplex, Inc., Singapore, from 1984 to 1996.

The performance of the filter bank is enhanced by optimizing the gains for each subband.

The output low-pass filter, customary after a two-level inverter, becomes obsolete, resulting in a small size of the system, as the SC circuit can be miniaturized. Both stages are operated at a high switching frequency, resulting in a high-frequency inverter output, as required by some industrial applications. A Fourier analysis of the output waveform is performed. The design is optimized with reference to the nominal duty-cycle for obtaining the minimum total harmonic distortion.

Moreover, the two-port parameter values are computed for particular input voltages and output currents for the complete N-stage rectifier circuit using only the measured I-V and C-V characteristics of a single diode. To validate the model a three-stage modified-Greinacher full-wave rectifier was realized in an silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) CMOS 0.5-/spl mu/m technology. The measurements are in excellent agreement with the values calculated using the presented model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556784/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","volume":"52","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8686611","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556784/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A model for /spl mu/-power rectifier analysis and design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for /spl mu/-power rectifier analysis and design","sourcePdf":"01556784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08427S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"33114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"33114","articleId":"1556784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1556797,"authors":[{"name":"Xingwu Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Xingwu Chen","id":"37088011969"},{"name":"Weinian Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Weinian Zhang","id":"37087815964"},{"name":"Weidong Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Power College, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Weidong Zhang","id":"37088015312"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"1556797","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"In order to analyze complex oscillations with a large deviation for a nonlinear nonautonomous power-transmission system, heteroclinic and subharmonic bifurcations are discussed by technically computing Melnikov functions with the residue of a complex function and elliptic integrals, which gives a condition of parameters for chaotic oscillation and one for periodic oscillation.

The proposed technique ascertains the input match frequency of the circuit by using a built-in self-test (BiST) structure, determines the frequency interval by which it needs to be shifted to restore it to the desired value, and then feeds back a digital word to the low-noise amplifier (LNA), which adaptively corrects its input-match in real-time. The circuitry presented in the paper offers the advantages of low power overheads (the circuits can be powered off when not in use), robustness, no requirements of digital signal processing cores or processors, and fast calibration times (less than 30 /spl mu/s). This proof of concept is demonstrated by designing a cascode LNA and the complete self-calibration circuit in IBM 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS RF process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8686614","htmlLink":"/document/1556799/","displayDocTitle":"Self-calibration of input-match in RF front-end circuitry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-calibration of input-match in RF front-end circuitry","sourcePdf":"01556799.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040424S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"33115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"33115","articleId":"1556799","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556803,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This results in increased speed, resolution, and dynamic range requirements for the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). High-speed and high-accuracy designs can be achieved by using oversampling ADC structures, which demand amplifiers with a high gain and a high unity-gain frequency. Due to the difficulty to meet both of these specifications, the ADC resolution at a frequency in the megahertz range appears to be limited by amplifier settling requirements. Design techniques to improve the ADC performance are presented. The proposed modulator structure uses the double-sampled technique, which increases by a factor of two the maximum speed of operation and correctly operates even with low dc gain amplifiers. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly improved by a calibration stage, which dynamically estimates the offset errors to be removed by a simple subtraction from the output signal.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2005.853513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/33115/01556803.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"845","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2005.853513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-frequency double-sampling second-order /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A high-frequency double-sampling second-order /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulator","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556803/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686618","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556803/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-frequency double-sampling second-order /spl Delta//spl Sigma/ modulator","sourcePdf":"01556803.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04517S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"33115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33115","articleId":"1556803","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1556805,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

Efficient dynamic-programming algorithms exist for solving this problem, however current solutions still require significant scan times. These scan time requirements are likely to become even more severe due to the rapid growth in the size of these databases. In this paper, we present a new approach to bio-sequence database scanning using re-configurable field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware platforms to gain high performance at low cost. Efficient mappings of the Smith-Waterman algorithm using fine-grained parallel processing elements (PEs) that are tailored toward the parameters of a query have been designed. We use customization opportunities available at run time to dynamically reconfigure the PEs to make better use of available resources. Our FPGA implementation achieves a speedup of approximately 170 for linear gap penalties and 125 for affine gap penalties compared to a standard desktop computing platform. We show how run-time reconfiguration can be used to further improve performance.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/33115/01556805.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable architectures for bio-sequence database scanning on FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2005.853340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2005.853340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable architectures for bio-sequence database scanning on FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8686620","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556805/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable architectures for bio-sequence database scanning on FPGAs","sourcePdf":"01556805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057443S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"33115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"33115","articleId":"1556805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1556810,"authors":[{"name":"W.

We assume that the fading channels keep constant only within each OFDM block, and may change independently from one OFDM block to another. The differential schemes proposed for MIMO-OFDM systems in the literature cannot successfully decode with such a rapidly fading channel, since the successful decoding of the previously existing schemes relies on the assumption that the fading channel keeps constant within a period of several OFDM blocks, and it changes slowly from a period of several OFDM blocks to another. In our proposed DSFM scheme, the transmitted signals are differentially encoded in the frequency domain within each OFDM block. Thus, the differential decoding can be performed over subcarriers within each single OFDM block. Furthermore, if a statistical channel power-delay profile (PDP) is known at the transmitter, we propose to create a smooth logical channel to improve the performance of the DSFM scheme. We obtain the smooth logical channel by sorting the channel frequency responses over subcarriers from a statistical point of view. If the logical channel is not smooth enough, we further consider a pruning process in which we use only the \"good\" part of the channel and get rid of the \"bad\" part of the channel. Simulation results show that the proposed DSFM scheme over a smooth logical channel (with pruning, if necessary) performs well for various channel PDPs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.860070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33116/01556829.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.860070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33116","startPage":"2024","endPage":"2028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential space-frequency modulation via smooth logical channel for broadband wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Differential space-frequency modulation via smooth logical channel for broadband wireless communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556829/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8684325","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556829/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential space-frequency modulation via smooth logical channel for broadband wireless communications","sourcePdf":"01556829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069979S","chronDate":"Dec.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33116","articleId":"1556829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556832,"authors":[{"name":"R.

An interesting feature of the proposed approach is that symbol-based source statistics in the form of the transition probabilities of the Markov source are exploited as a priori information on a bit-level trellis. This method is especially well-suited for long input blocks, since in contrast to other symbol-based APP decoding approaches, the number of trellis states does not depend on the packet length. When additionally the variable-length encoded source data is protected by channel codes, an iterative source-channel decoding scheme can be obtained in the same way as for serially concatenated codes. Furthermore, based on an analysis of the iterative decoder via extrinsic information transfer charts, it can be shown that by using reversible variable-length codes with a free distance of two, in combination with rate-1 channel codes and residual source redundancy, a reliable transmission is possible even for highly corrupted channels. This justifies a new source-channel encoding technique where explicit redundancy for error protection is only added in the source encoder.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556832/","volume":"53","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556832/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8684328","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity iterative joint source-channel decoding for variable-length encoded Markov sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity iterative joint source-channel decoding for variable-length encoded Markov sources","sourcePdf":"01556832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072542S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"33116","articleId":"1556832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1556833,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this paper, we show how multi-h CPM signals can also be represented in this manner. The decomposition is presented in general terms as a function of the alphabet size, modulation indexes, and phase pulse of the CPM scheme. The number of pulses required to exactly construct the signal is shown to increase over that previously given for single-h schemes; this increase is in proportion to the number of modulation indexes. We propose an approximation which significantly reduces the number of signal pulses and which minimizes the mean-squared error for an arbitrary set of modulation indexes. We show that this approximation can have two objectives: 1) to reduce the number of pulses in the same manner as has been proposed for single-h schemes; and/or 2) to reduce the number of multi-h pulses; we also show the conditions where this latter objective is most practical. We compare this minimum mean-squared error approximation with another method which was recently proposed for CPM. We also give numerical results on detection performance which demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approximation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.860064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33116","startPage":"2065","endPage":"2075","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33116/01556833.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAM decomposition of M-ary multi-h CPM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556833/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"PAM decomposition of M-ary multi-h CPM","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8684329","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAM decomposition of M-ary multi-h CPM","sourcePdf":"01556833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06655S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"33116","articleId":"1556833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1556834,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Time-domain equalization relies on minimum mean-square error criterion and operates on multidimensional modulation symbols, whose individual components can be detected in accordance with another criterion.

Consequently, theoretical performance results are unknown for three- and four-branch equal gain combining (EGC), selection combining (SC), and generalized SC (GSC) in correlated Rayleigh fading. This paper redresses this gap by deriving new infinite series representations for the joint probability density function (pdf) and the joint cumulative distribution function (cdf) of three and four correlated Rayleigh RVs. Bounds on the error resulting from truncating the infinite series are derived. A classical approach, due to Miller, is used to derive our results. Unfortunately, Miller's approach cannot be extended to more than four variates and, in fact, the quadrivariate case considered in this paper appears to be the most general result possible. For brevity, we treat only a limited number of applications in this paper. The new pdf and cdf expressions are used to derive the outage probability of three-branch SC, the moments of the EGC output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the moment generating function of the GSC(2,3) output SNR in arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh fading. A novel application of Bonferroni's inequalities allows new outage bounds for multibranch SC in arbitrarily correlated Rayleigh channels.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.860059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33116","startPage":"2092","endPage":"2101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33116/01556835.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Infinite series representations of the trivariate and quadrivariate Rayleigh distribution and their applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556835/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Infinite series representations of the trivariate and quadrivariate Rayleigh distribution and their applications","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8684331","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Infinite series representations of the trivariate and quadrivariate Rayleigh distribution and their applications","sourcePdf":"01556835.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111225S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"33116","articleId":"1556835","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556836,"authors":[{"name":"Jaekyun Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/33116/1556836/1556836-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaekyun Moon (S'89-M'90-SM'97-F'05) received the B.S.E.E. degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 1987 and 1990, respectively.","He held a short-term position with IBM Research in 1987.

Our work is based on low-complexity suboptimal soft-output channel detection using a constrained-delay (CD) a posteriori probability (APP) algorithm. Central to the proposed idea is the incorporation of effective decision-feedback schemes, which significantly reduce complexity while providing immunity against error propagation that typically plagues decision-feedback schemes. We observe that the effect of decision feedback is quite different on turbo equalization versus traditional, hard-decision-generating and noniterative equalization. In particular, we demonstrate that when the feedback scheme applied is inadequate for the given equalizer parameters and ISI condition, the extrinsic information generated by the equalizer becomes distinctly non-Gaussian, and the quality of soft information, as monitored by the trajectory of mutual information, fails to improve in the iterative process. We identify parameters of feedback-based CD-APP schemes that offer favorable complexity/performance tradeoffs, compared with existing turbo-equalization techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33116/01556836.pdf","startPage":"2102","endPage":"2113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.860057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.860057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo equalization via constrained-delay APP estimation with decision feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Intersymbol interference","Detectors","Interference constraints","Iterative decoding","Maximum likelihood decoding","Moon","Filters","Information analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo codes","iterative decoding","maximum likelihood estimation","intersymbol interference","channel coding","error correction codes","decision feedback equalisers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo equalization","constrained-delay a posteriori probability estimation","decision feedback","intersymbol interference","channels","ISI","channel detector","error-correction decoder","low-complexity suboptimal soft-output channel detection","error propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Equalization","intersymbol interference (ISI)","iterative methods","maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection","turbo equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","displayDocTitle":"Turbo equalization via constrained-delay APP estimation with decision feedback","volume":"53","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/1556836/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","accessionNumber":"8684332","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo equalization via constrained-delay APP estimation with decision feedback","sourcePdf":"01556836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117614S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33116","articleId":"1556836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556837,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/33116/1556837/1556837-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Cui (S'04) received the B.E. degree in information engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2003.

While the ML search complexity is exponential in the number of transmit antennas and the data rate, our algorithm, particularly in high signal-to-noise ratio, achieves significant computational savings over the naive ML algorithm and the previous detector based on lattice reduction. We also develop four BID variants for MSD. The first two are ML and use branch-and-bound, the third one is suboptimal, which first uses BID to generate a candidate subset and then exhaustively searches over the reduced space, and the last one generalizes decision-feedback differential detection.

By using the code's good properties of zero autocorrelation sidelobes and cross-correlation functions of at most one, each user is assigned M=2/sup m/ shifted copies of its own code matrix to represent m data bits per symbol with minimal interference. The advantages of our scheme are that: 1) a lower baud rate O-CDMA system can now support a higher bit rate; 2) no network synchronization is required; 3) no M-fold increase in code cardinality is needed, as compared with standard M-code keying; 4) the numbers of optical encoders and decoders can be reduced from M to one per user, a major hardware cost savings; and 5) user code confidentiality is enhanced, as compared with the transmission of one code matrix for each data-bit one in conventional \"on-off keying\" O-CDMA schemes. Finally, our performance analysis shows that there is a tradeoff between the error probability and the choice of M.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2005.860041","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/33116/01556841.pdf","startPage":"2150","endPage":"2156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2005.860041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shifted carrier-hopping prime codes for multicode keying in wavelength-time O-CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Shifted carrier-hopping prime codes for multicode keying in wavelength-time O-CDMA","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1556841/","accessionNumber":"8684337","volume":"53","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shifted carrier-hopping prime codes for multicode keying in wavelength-time O-CDMA","sourcePdf":"01556841.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095806S","chronDate":"Dec. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"33116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"33116","articleId":"1556841","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556859,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In order to limit the effect of these distortions, estimation, and subsequently equalization of the concatenated fiber-wireless channel should be done. The estimation of the fiber-wireless uplink was done in a single user CDMA environment. This paper focuses on estimation in a multiuser CDMA environment by utilizing the properties of pseudonoise (PN) spreading codes. We also consider both wireless channel and optical receiver noise. Furthermore, we propose a new iterative technique to mitigate the adverse effect of multiple access interference (MAI) on the identification process. Numerical evaluations of the developed algorithm show a good estimation of both the linear and nonlinear systems with 10 users, an SNR of 25 dB between the mobile user and RAP, and an optical noise power equalling the wireless noise power","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of radio-over-fiber uplink in a multiuser CDMA environment using PN spreading codes","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1556864","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01556864.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1556864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of radio-over-fiber uplink in a multiuser CDMA environment using PN spreading codes","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1556864/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9060542","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of radio-over-fiber uplink in a multiuser CDMA environment using PN spreading codes","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556864.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080371S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1556864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1556866,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Weng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Jianfeng Weng","id":"38274940200"},{"name":"Ping Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Ping Wang","id":"38271119800"},{"name":"Tho Le-Ngoc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"lastName":"Tho Le-Ngoc","id":"37271236200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8885-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"1556866","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical modulation","Multiaccess communication","Pulse modulation","Optical receivers","Optical noise","Multiple access interference","Optical pulses","Fiber gratings","Bragg gratings","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","code division multiple access","light interference","optical fibre networks","optical limiters","optical modulation","optical receivers","pulse modulation","random sequences","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional optical CDMA systems","multiwavelength pulse modulation","double hard-limiters","optical code-division multiple-access","receiver","FBG","multiple-access interference","photo-detectors","random sequence spreading","Poisson model"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a two-dimensional (2D) optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) system with multi-wavelength pulse modulation (MWPM) and double optical hard-limiters (DHL).

The robustness is achieved thanks to the incorporation of nonlinear limiters with properly selected thresholds. We formalize a jump Markov linear-trend framework to cover the overall possible channel dynamics. With this setup, we derive a LT models-based channel tracker. Subsequently, the predicted channel and one-step delayed decisions are utilized to yield a robust MMSE-DFE.

MIMO has also been applied to multi-conductor channels where the cross-talk between the individual conductors limits cable capacity. Here, the theoretical capacity of two structures is compared: completely random complex Gaussian (i.i.d.) and circulant (feasible for cables). The comparison is extended to a practicable capacity using QAM modulations. It is shown that for large SNRs, where there is enough power to use all the eigenchannels, circulant structures show higher capacity. For small SNRs, the water-filling eigenchannel cut-off feature means that the completely random channel case has the higher capacity. The more similar pdfs of the eigenvalues of the circulant is the mechanism for higher capacity for large SNRs. This is confirmed by the theorem of maximum capacity for the parallel channels","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01556890.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"121","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1556890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1556890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1556890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circulant wired MIMO structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Antennas and propagation","Signal to noise ratio","Conductors","Cables","Channel capacity","Fading","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","crosstalk","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","MIMO systems","quadrature amplitude modulation","radiowave propagation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circulant wired MIMO structures","MIMO","wireless systems","propagation channel","multiconductor channels","cable capacity","random complex Gaussian","QAM modulations","water-filling eigenchannel cut-off feature","random channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1556890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"Circulant wired MIMO structures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1556890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9053203","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circulant wired MIMO structures","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01556890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060376S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1556890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1556891,"authors":[{"name":"Dung Ngoc Dao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"],"lastName":"Dung Ngoc Dao","id":"37295825300"},{"name":"C.

Recently, this ICI is shown to be mitigated by using the partial transmit sequence (PTS), in which the PTS weights minimizing the peak ICI noise-to-signal power ratio (MinMax search) are selected. The exhaustive search leads to exponential complexity in the number of PTS weights. Therefore, an algorithm using a modified sphere decoder to avoid exhaustive search is proposed. Furthermore, a new algorithm called MinSum is also introduced to minimize the total ICI power. Compared with exhaustive search, the MinMax and MinSum algorithms reduce complexity by IO and 170 times.

In this system, several base station multi-antenna arrays are distributed in a given area. Each array is communicating with the base station via optical fiber links. All signal processing is performed at the base station. Users are spatially separated such that in each tone of the OFDM symbol only a certain number of users (out of the total number of users) are selected.

Unfortunately, the vast amount of multimedia content needed to transmit or store a stereo image pair or video sequence has hindered its use in commercial applications. As H.264 offers significantly enhanced compression and a \"network-friendly\" feature, we have used a H.264 compliant stereoscopic video codec to compress stereo video. The data partitioning (DP) mode in NAL unit of the H.264 codec is exploited for the use of joint source and channel coding (JSCC) taking channel qualities and reliabilities into account. In this paper, we propose a framework of using unequal error protection (UEP) based JSCC scheme on the H.264 compliant stereoscopic video transmission for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.

Correct path loss introduces one of the most destructive effects on the M-algorithm which mostly leads to catastrophic error. In the proposed M-algorithm survivor decision scheme, the M surviving states are not selected solely based on their own path metric. Among the M surviving states, some states with the best path metrics survive and also some other states whose ancestors have had the best path metrics survive. This way of survivor selection enables us to avoid correct path loss if an abrupt noise deteriorates the correct path metric severely. Simulation results show that the error rate performance of the ancestor-based survivor decision in some cases is slightly better than currently-best survivor decision scheme in the presence of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

Of all the stages in the decoding process of a JPEG file, the IDCT is the most computationally intensive. Hence, we require fast and efficient implementations, either in software or hardware. Numerous individual designs for computing the ID-IDCT have been proposed. Our 2D-IDCT incorporates two of our ID-IDCT cores and a transpose network to provide a stall-free pipeline. In this paper, we describe a fast hardware implementation of a two-dimensional IDCT architecture that implements a variation of the modified Loeffler algorithm.

In the third step, the interactive system acquires the user's preferences on tradeoffs of the two objectives of cost and efficiencies.

The scalability of this new standard allows trading off between compression rate and quality of image. Due to the multi-resolution nature of wavelet transforms, they have been adopted by the JPEG2000 standard as the transform of choice. In this work, we present an implementation for a re configurable fully scalable integer wavelet transform (IWT) unit that satisfies the specifications of the JPEG2000 standard. The implementation is based on the lifting scheme, which is the most computation efficient implementation of the discrete wavelet transform. Integer wavelet transforms, also known as reversible DWT, have recently received special interest due to a number of significant properties in terms of computational efficiency and storage requirements. The lifting scheme-based integer wavelet transform (IWT) unit was implemented in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), namely the Xilinx Vertix II family. The design is scalable in order to allow a trade off between rate and distortion. A maximum clock frequency of 112 MHz, with throughput of over 400 pixels/s, was achieved by employing techniques such as parallel operation of independent units and pipelining.

Applications that fit this model include polygon rendering (computer graphics), matrix multiplication (scientific computing), 2D convolution (media processing), and data encryption (security). Computers that exploit stream computations process data faster than conventional microcomputers because they utilize a memory system and an execution model that increases on-chip bandwidth and delivers high throughput. We have designed a general-purpose, parameterizable, SIMD stream processor that operates on IEEE single-precision floating point data. The system is implemented in VHDL, and consists of a configurable FPU, execution unit array, and memory interface. The FPU supports pipelined operations for multiplication, addition, division, and square root. The data width is configurable. The execution array operates in lock-step with an instruction controller, which issues 32-bit instructions to the execution array. To exploit stream parallelism, the number of execution units as well as the number of interleaved threads is specified as a parameter at compilation time. The memory system allows all execution units to access one element of data from memory in every clock cycle.

Distributed amplifiers promise to meet the broad band requirements. However, compound semiconductor solutions come at a high cost, and CMOS designs have thus far exhibited high parasitics and losses. There has been recent interest in fully monolithic designs using SiGe HBTs. We demonstrate a SiGe distributed amplifier with a cutoff frequency of 18.5 GHz with a power dissipation of 13 mW. This is an order of magnitude improvement over published DA designs in either SiGe or CMOS platforms. This may be reduced still further to the sub-10 mW range at the expense of slightly lower gain.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557059","startPage":"839","endPage":"841","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01557059.pdf","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ultra low-power, fully monolithic SiGe HBT distributed amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"An ultra low-power, fully monolithic SiGe HBT distributed amplifier","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1557059/","accessionNumber":"9071973","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1557059/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ultra low-power, fully monolithic SiGe HBT distributed amplifier","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01557059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041338S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1557059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1557073,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The algorithm recovers the offset from data modulated carriers without relying on redundant data such as pilots carriers, null carriers, or training sequences. A phase equivalent model for the algorithm is presented, and simulations are employed to verify the concept","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier frequency offset recovery for a zero-IF OFDM receiver","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557120","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01557120.pdf","startPage":"892","endPage":"895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1557120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1557120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"Carrier frequency offset recovery for a zero-IF OFDM receiver","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1557120/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9053206","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier frequency offset recovery for a zero-IF OFDM receiver","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01557120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04457S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1557120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1557121,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The development in multi-resolution analysis such as wavelet transform has helped overcome this difficulty. It was found that the results using the combination of wavelet statistical and wavelet co-occurrence features generated from discrete wavelet transform for texture classification are promising.

The multistage parallel interference cancellation (MPIC) receiver is considered a serious candidate for practical implementation showing a good tradeoff between performance and complexity.

The circuit also has a second output to test the effects of using an on-chip filter in low-power designs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using class-E PAs for short-range, low-power applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557204","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01557204.pdf","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1254","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.65V CMOS power amplifier for biotelemetry applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"A 0.65V CMOS power amplifier for biotelemetry applications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1557204/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9053284","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1557204/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.65V CMOS power amplifier for biotelemetry applications","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01557204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041286S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1557204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1557212,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is the collection of computationally efficient algorithms that perform the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). For our purposes, we will use its efficient computation for polynomial multiplication.

In order to take advantage of these systems several layered space-time architectures have been proposed. However, to allow high data rate applications, frequency selective BLAST (FS-BLAST) detector has to be used in order to detect signals buried in both co-channel interference (CCI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). It employs a multiple input single output (MISO) decision feedback structure to detect the distinct layers in a successive manner.

Since the needle appears as a straight line in medical images, the Hough transform for straight-line detection is a natural and powerful choice for needle segmentation. However, the transform is computationally expensive, and in the standard form is ineffective for real-time segmentation applications. We propose a dedicated hardware architecture for the Hough transform based on distributed arithmetic (DA) principles that results in a real-time implementation. This architecture exploits the inherent parallelism of the Hough transform, and reduces the overall computation time. This procedure, combined with the parallel structure significantly reduces computation times, thus facilitating real-time implementation. The DA-Hough transform architecture has been implemented using the Xilinx FPGA. For a 256times256 image, the proposed design takes 0.1 ms to 1.2 ms to process the Hough transform when the feature points in the image are varied from 2% to 50% of the total image, which are well within the bounds of real-time operation, and thus can facilitate needle segmentation in real time","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01557257.pdf","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1472","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1557257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed arithmetic hardware architecture for real-time Hough transform based segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arithmetic","Hardware","Image segmentation","Needles","Computer architecture","Concurrent computing","Biopsy","Surgery","Biomedical imaging","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","Hough transforms","image segmentation","medical image processing","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed arithmetic hardware architecture","real-time Hough transform based segmentation","biopsy needles","image-guided surgery","Xilinx FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1557257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"A distributed arithmetic hardware architecture for real-time Hough transform based segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1557257/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9060604","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed arithmetic hardware architecture for real-time Hough transform based segmentation","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01557257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040294S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1557257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1557265,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The three-phase flyback converter required a unique pattern of PWM to optimise the power transfer in the magnetic circuit used in the converter. The three-phase PWM is generated digitally based on uniform symmetrical sampling technique using Xilinx chip. The generated PWM pattern is able to reduce the magnitude of the low order of harmonic components present in the input AC supply. Although software simulation could simulate the PWM pattern, it does not represent the exact pattern as been generated digitally. The mathematical approach used is to model the PWM pattern exactly as been created digitally. The proposed mathematical technique could also be used to analyse any digital PWM. The result of the mathematical analysis on the PWM pattern could be used to study the characteristics of the pattern such as maximum and minimum value of duty cycle, pulse width, turn-on time, turn-off time and modulation index. To verify the validity of the proposed technique, the results obtained from the mathematical model, experimental and simulation using PSpice were compared","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557265","startPage":"1505","endPage":"1508","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01557265.pdf","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of three-phase uniform symmetrical sampling digital PWM for power converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of three-phase uniform symmetrical sampling digital PWM for power converter","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1557265/","accessionNumber":"9053065","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1557265/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of three-phase uniform symmetrical sampling digital PWM for power converter","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01557265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036968S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1557265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1557286,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Conventional cameras have restricted field of view while omni-directional cameras provide 360-degree field of view. Depth information obtained from stereo vision is very useful for robot navigation in complex environments. This paper presents an omni-directional stereo vision system for Arvand robots constructed by Sharif CE Middle size RoboCup team. We have used two catadioptric cameras aligned vertically. To compute depth, we have used a neural network. In our approach, we trained the neural network without unwrapping the images and without calibration, by using a small training set and acceptable training time. This is an important factor when such systems need to be used in research labs to make prototype versions.

The types and sizes of wind turbine generators (WTGs), the tilt angles and sizes of photovoltaic (PV) panels and the capacity of batteries must be optimized when sizing a standalone hybrid wind/PV power system, which may be defined as a mixed multiple-criteria integer programming problem. In our research, we investigated the genetic algorithm (GA) with elitist strategy for optimally sizing a standalone hybrid wind/PV power system. Our objective is selected as minimizing the total capital cost, subject to the constraint of the loss of power supply probability (LPSP). The LPSP of every individual of the GA's population is calculated by simulation of 8760 hours in a year. Studies have proved that the genetic algorithm converges very well and the methodology proposed is feasible for optimally sizing standalone hybrid wind/PV power systems.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557315","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01557315.pdf","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1725","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal sizing of standalone hybrid wind/PV power systems using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1557315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"Optimal sizing of standalone hybrid wind/PV power systems using genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","accessionNumber":"9053095","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1557315/","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal sizing of standalone hybrid wind/PV power systems using genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01557315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051437S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1557315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1557322,"authors":[{"name":"Yangjie Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"lastName":"Yangjie Wang","id":"37088119102"},{"name":"M.Z.

Since channel tracking plays an essential role in practice in equalization of the receiver, a new and viable design approach, a modified interacting multiple-model (MIMM) algorithm, is proposed for tracking of multipath time-varying fading channels. We employ a set of second-order auto-regressive (AR2) multiple models associated with a Makov jump process to cover the range of channel dynamics. This setup leads to an AR2-based MIMM channel tracker which can automatically adjust channel model parameters to track time-varying fading channels for all times once some design parameters are initialized. We employ a Kalman filter as a symbol detector (KBSD).

Unfortunately, no general method has been found. The performance of a quality metric is normally gauged by its prediction accuracy, monotonicity and consistency. It is also expected to mirror the quality scores assigned by independent human observers. Research to this point has generally focused on full-reference (FR) measures that assume that coded and original images are available. Often times, an original is not easily obtainable, or perhaps does not even exist. Therefore, researchers have recently shown a great deal of interest in developing reduced-reference (RR) and no-reference (NR) metrics. This study implements and compares some of the most common IQMs and seeks to determine if there is any difference in their performance.

Digital cameras, Web cameras, optical mouses, and smart sensors are some examples. One of the most used CMOS image sensor architectures is based on the active pixel sensor (APS). In order to understand more design tradeoffs, a prototype chip was designed to evaluate different pixel architectures. This paper describes the prototype chip and the test results. The prototype chip is composed of 8 different pixels and a 3-to-8 row decoder. There are two different APS architectures, 3 transistor or 4 transistor. The 8 different pixels are based on the 2 APS architectures with some variations. These variations are 2 types of reset transistor, N/sub mos/ or P/sub mos/, and 2 types of photodiodes, n/sup +/ - p/sub sub/ and n/sub well/ - p/sub sub/. The prototype chip was manufactured in a standard 3.3 V 0.35 /spl mu/m 1-poly 4-metal CMOS process. The row decoder was designed using a pass transistor network, inverters, and pull-up transistors. The test results show that for white light, n/sup +/ - p/sub sub/ photodiodes and n/sub well/ - p/sub sub/ photodiodes have approximately the same response. Also, 4 transistor pixels have better response, but the voltage range for linear operation is smaller. 3 transistor pixels have larger voltage range for linear operation and less dark current. The results also confirm that the output of the pixels is inversely proportional to the distance of the light source.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557381","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01557381.pdf","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","endPage":"2020","startPage":"2017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test results of various CMOS image sensor pixels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1557381/","displayDocTitle":"Test results of various CMOS image sensor pixels","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1557381/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","accessionNumber":"9053069","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test results of various CMOS image sensor pixels","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01557381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0352S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1557381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1557385,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In the proposed method the search area is adaptively found for each block of a frame. The designated search area is similar to that of the full search algorithm but smaller for most blocks of a frame. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is like FS in terms of regularity but requires less computational complexity.

The term \"'stunt flocking\" is analogous to clustering around an optimal solution in domain of the problem considered. Instead of looking at PSO as using individuality and sociality, we adopt the viewpoint of exploration (selecting among all available options and observing outcomes) and exploiting (consistently choosing the global best option). Accordingly, we define two new operators, namely: exploration and exploiting operators for a permutation-based particle swarm algorithm. For exploiting operator we use an order-based imitation function to simulate imitation of the global best option. However, exploration operator is carried out as a result of two lower level operations: recalling the best solution in the memory of each particle and random shuffling of some elements in the permutation that represents each particle. Traveling sales person (TSP) and quadratic assignment (QA) problems are considered here for testing the algorithm. Matlab subcommands are used to illustrate how these operators can take place in programming code. Results of implementing the proposed technique to the mentioned problems agree to great extent with the known optimal solutions","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557397","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01557397.pdf","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2084","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New operators for integer permutation-based particle swarm optimizer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1557397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","displayDocTitle":"New operators for integer permutation-based particle swarm optimizer","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","accessionNumber":"9060581","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1557397/","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New operators for integer permutation-based particle swarm optimizer","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01557397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09084S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1557397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1557400,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SAS, Canada"],"lastName":"Zhijun Zhang","id":"37558676900"},{"name":"K.

Long-term bilateral contracts are attractive to many parties who want to avoid price volatility. With bilateral contracts it becomes necessary to allocate transmission loss to respective transactions. An artificial neural network based transmission loss allocation method is presented in this paper. The method is computationally efficient and can provide solutions on a real-time basis. Most independent system variables can be used as inputs to this neural network which in turn makes the loss allocation process responsive to practical situations. Training and testing of this network have been done with the help of the IEEE 24-bus test system. A technique has been developed to expedite the convergence and to improve the accuracy of the results. Numerical examples on loss allocations for both peak and off-peak hours have been provided and compared with those obtained using another technique.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557426","startPage":"2203","endPage":"2207","publicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2005.1557426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33117","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10384/33117/01557426.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An artificial neural network based transmission loss allocation for bilateral contracts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1557426/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An artificial neural network based transmission loss allocation for bilateral contracts","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1557426/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9053227","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2006","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An artificial neural network based transmission loss allocation for bilateral contracts","confLoc":"Saskatoon, SK, Canada","sourcePdf":"01557426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0598S","chronDate":"1-4 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10384","isNumber":"33117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10384","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"33117","articleId":"1557426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1557436,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It combines the data survivability properties and performance benefits of traditional RAIDs with the unprecedented flexibility of composition, improved security, and ease of development of stackable file systems. RAIF can be mounted on top of any combination of other file systems including network, distributed, disk-based, and memory-based file systems. Existing encryption, compression, antivirus, and consistency checking stackable file systems can be mounted above and below RAIF, to efficiently cope up with slow or unsecure branches. Individual files can be distributed across branches, replicated, stored with parity, or stored with erasure correction coding to recover from failures on multiple branches. Per-file incremental recovery, storage type migration, and load-balancing are especially well suited for grid storages. In this paper, we describe the current RAIF design, provide preliminary performance results and discuss current status and future directions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1558538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 2005","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 May 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1558538/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8652568","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Increasing distributed storage survivability with a stackable RAID-like file system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing distributed storage survivability with a stackable RAID-like file system","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"01558538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061166S","chronDate":"9-12 May 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10428","isNumber":"33121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10428","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33121","articleId":"1558538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1558544,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Sharing such high concentration of valuable resources requires special dedicated security mechanisms at various levels. Current solutions for autonomous systems are too intrusive to be deployed in a cluster. In order to develop new solutions adapted to the architecture, we consider a coupled approach for performing efficient anomalies and misuse detections in HPC environment. It relies on an instrumented node, and results in periodical sampling of applications, allowing the generation of specific security policies that can be used to perform further monitoring. This paper also deals with performance concerns and an approach is proposed in order to keep a tow overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive instrumented node for efficient anomalies and misuse detections in HPC environment","publicationTitle":"CCGrid 2005.

Molecular dynamics computer simulations are increasingly employed to understand the folding and unfolding of proteins. Running protein unfolding simulations is computationally expensive and finding ways to enhance performance is a grid issue on its own. However, more and more groups run such simulations and generate a myriad of data, which raises new challenges in managing and analyzing these data. Because the vast range of proteins researchers want to study and simulate, the computational effort needed to generate data, the large data volumes involved, and the different types of analyses scientists need to perform, it is desirable to provide a public repository allowing researchers to pool and share protein unfolding data. This paper describes efforts to provide a grid-enabled data warehouse for protein unfolding data. We outline the challenge and present first results in the design and implementation of the data warehouse.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid warehousing of molecular dynamics protein unfolding data","publicationTitle":"CCGrid 2005.

A good allocation is critical for efficient execution. However, many existing grid toolkits use matchmaking strategies that do not consider overall efficiency for the set of tasks to be run. We identify two families of resource allocation algorithms: task-based algorithms, that greedily allocate tasks to resources, and workflow-based algorithms, that search for an efficient allocation for the entire workflow. We compare the behavior of workflow-based algorithms and task-based algorithms, using simulations of workflows drawn from a real application and with varying ratios of computation cost to data transfer cost. We observe that workflow-based approaches have a potential to work better for data-intensive applications even when estimates about future tasks are inaccurate.","doi":"10.1109/CCGRID.2005.1558639","publicationTitle":"CCGrid 2005.

Genetic algorithms, due to their applicability for optimization solutions of nonlinear and stochastic scenarios, can find place in development of agents for distributed control. Advantages and special features of genetic algorithms for optimization are discussed, identifying some input and output variables. Requirement of compensator as an agent/sub-agent is also proposed. Finally the use case model is proposed showing assigned role of each agent. Each use case has been elaborated with its purpose, data handling, stimuli and responses. A lay out of the sub-systems of each of the proposed main agents has also been included.","doi":"10.1109/ICET.2005.1558916","pdfPath":"/iel5/10430/33125/01558916.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"411","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Emerging Technologies, 2005.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Emerging Technologies, 2005.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2005.1558916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use case model of genetic algorithms of agents for control of distributed power system networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1558916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Use case model of genetic algorithms of agents for control of distributed power system networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8749126","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1558916/","conferenceDate":"18-18 Sept. 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use case model of genetic algorithms of agents for control of distributed power system networks","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"01558916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041544S","chronDate":"17-18 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10430","isNumber":"33125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10430","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"33125","articleId":"1558916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1558942,"authors":[{"name":"Q.M.

An example of this can be provided by the W-band (70-110 GHz). Recently, a scientific experiment carried on by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), namely the DAVID-DCE experiment, was aimed at exploring the technical feasibility of the exploitation of the W-band for broadband networking applications. Some preliminary results of DAVID research activities pointed out that phase noise and high Doppler-shift can severely compromise the efficiency of the modulation system, particularly for what concerns the aspects related to the carrier recovery. This problem becomes very critical when the use of spectrally efficient M-ary modulations is considered in order to profitably exploit the large amount of bandwidth available in the W-band. In this work, a novel carrier recovery algorithm has been proposed for a 16-QAM modulation and tested, considering the presence of phase noise and other kinds of non-ideal behaviors of the communication devices typical of W-band satellite transmission. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness the proposed solution for carrier recovery and pointed out the achievable spectral efficiency of the transmission system, considering some constraints about transmitted power, data BER and receiver bandwidth","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2005.1559428","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10432/33126/01559428.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2005.1559428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33126","startPage":"1379","endPage":"1390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient carrier recovery scheme for high-bit-rate W-band satellite communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An efficient carrier recovery scheme for high-bit-rate W-band satellite communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-12 March 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559428/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-12 March 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8957500","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1559428/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient carrier recovery scheme for high-bit-rate W-band satellite communication systems","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"01559428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072304S","chronDate":"5-12 March 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10432","isNumber":"33126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10432","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"33126","articleId":"1559428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1559430,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is vital to precisely model limiters and high power amplifiers (HPAs) to determine the spectrum distortion and other types of degradation associated with multicarrier communication systems. Contemporary simulation tools can be employed to precisely ascertain intermodulation (IM) distortion and its effect and impact on both in-band and out-of-band IM performance in a computationally timely manner. This paper illustrates analysis and simulation results in a parameterized form when the amplifier input consists of two 8-PSK modulated signals with raised cosine filter shaping. One of the significant parameters in these analyses and simulated results is the HPA operational back-off (OBO) power level, which is studied over a range of about 6 dB. The simulation illustrates the intermodulation distortion both within the signal band and outside the signal band. A novel approach is used to represent an HPA in terms of a power series expansion, which converges very rapidly and gives significant insight and provides a useful tool in predicting the spectral content of the HPA output.

On Earth, large aperture telescopes in excess of 10m also have the disadvantage of undergoing gravitational and other environmental effects.

It becomes a critical issue for the LEO-Sat program, however, when the command and control is provided from a small ground station with limited capabilities (low transmit EIRP and receive G/T), and when the satellite is in a contingency mode of operation, such as tumbling (antennas off pointed). Previous link analyses have shown that the satellite link would be adequate when commanding from large remote tracking stations (RTS) with a larger antenna (45- or 60-foot dish). This paper deals with command and control of this new LEO-Sat in its early orbit, using a small remote tracking station (RTS), with a 33-foot antenna. Our analyses have proven that the uplink and downlink can be closed even with a small RTS station with a 33-ft antenna. The details of these analyses are given in this paper. The communication link performances, both during normal operations as well as in contingency tumbling mode of operations, are presented here. Both the SNR (signal to noise ratio) and the threshold techniques were shown side-by-side, in the link analyses, for normal and anomalous tumbling cases, with similar results. The conclusion in Section 5 summarizes the analyses. Aerospace personnel and the satellite contractor came to a similar conclusion: that the uplink and downlink (to and from the satellite) using small RTS stations with a 33-ft antenna have adequate link margin. In normal mode, worst-case LEO-Sat and nominal small RTS station parameters were used in the analysis. In contingency mode or tumbling mode, the worst worst-case parameters for LEO-Sat and for a small RTS station were used. A summary of the results of the analyses performed for the uplink and downlink communication paths are given in this paper","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-12 March 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8957529","htmlLink":"/document/1559457/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","conferenceDate":"5-12 March 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) link considerations for a LEO Sat","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C) link considerations for a LEO Sat","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"01559457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047207S","chronDate":"5-12 March 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10432","isNumber":"33126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10432","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"33126","articleId":"1559457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559464,"authors":[{"name":"K.

This idea led to the design of two novel algorithms for anomaly detection. The first existing algorithm, referred to as semiparametric (SemiP), is based on some of the advances made on semiparametric inference. The second algorithm, proposed in this paper and referred to as a combined F test (CFT), is based on a nonparametric model and has its test statistic behaving asymptotically under the Fisher's F family of distributions. A major drawback of the SemiP detector is its dependence on a function maximization routine, which requires initialization and no guarantees of convergence. The CFT detector is free of such dependence. Experimental results using real hyperspectral data are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of both algorithms in comparison to the industry standard approach.

It has been shown that the ISMSE is a cross-validation metric that is useful for determining the optimum rank of the multistage Wiener filter (MWF) subspace. This is because it gives a more accurate estimate of the true ensemble mean squared error (MSE) provided by a Wiener filter, as compared to the standard least squares sample mean squared error (SMSE). The innovation described herein directly exploits this improved MSE estimator within the AMF calculation. Together with the reduced rank MWF solution, this results in improved detection performance in low sample support environments.

However, there are several problems that still need to be addressed. In particular, single-event-transient (SET) hardening of peripheral circuitry, including row and column decoders, sense amplifiers, as well as the EDAC circuitry itself, has not been adequately addressed. We have designed a self-scrubbing, multi-bank SRAM with EDAC that corrects single-bit errors without redundancy in the memory cells, with no downtime. Access times are only a single gate delay more than an unhardened SRAM. Furthermore, the peripheral circuitry is hardened with respect to single-event transients. The area overhead for this SET hardening is a constant, independent of the number of bits in the SRAM. We have designed SRAMs based on three different types of memory cells: 1) the six-transistor (6T) SRAM cell, 2) a one-transistor, one-capacitor (1T1C) DRAM cell, and 3) a single (edgeless) transistor (1T) DRAM cell. We have demonstrated that the soft-error rate for our memories is well under 10-10 errors per bit per day, for all three types of memory cells. The area per memory cell is about 3times smaller for the 1T1C compared to the 6T, while the area per memory cell is about 2times smaller for the 1T versus the 6T. All three designs employ minimum area memory cells","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Error correction","Logic gates","Delay","Radiation hardening","Combinational circuits","Clocks","Logic design","Error analysis","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","error correction","error detection","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-event-transient hardening","error detection and correction","EDAC","single gate delay","peripheral circuitry","SET hardening","memory cells","six-transistor SRAM cell","6T SRAM cell","one-transistor, one-capacitor DRAM cell","1T1C DRAM cell","single transistor DRAM cell","1T DRAM cell","soft-error rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559543","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2005.1559543","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10432/33126/01559543.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2005.1559543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559543/","displayDocTitle":"SEE-Hardened-by-Design Area-Efficient SRAMs","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-12 March 2005","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","accessionNumber":"8977655","htmlLink":"/document/1559543/","conferenceDate":"5-12 March 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEE-Hardened-by-Design Area-Efficient SRAMs","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"01559543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065887S","chronDate":"5-12 March 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10432","isNumber":"33126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10432","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"33126","articleId":"1559543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1559544,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper develops a fault tolerant control architecture that couples techniques for fault detection and identification with reconfigurable flight control to augment the reliability and autonomy of an unmanned aerial vehicle. The architecture is applicable to fixed and rotary wing aircraft. An adaptive neural network feedback linearization technique is employed to stabilize the vehicle after the detection of a fault. Actual flight test results support the validity of the approach on an unmanned helicopter. The fault tolerant control architecture recovers aircraft performance after the occurrence of four different faults in the flight control system: three swash-plate actuator faults and a collective actuator fault.

This method resolves and tracks characteristic changes in the natural torsional vibration frequencies that are associated with shaft crack propagation. While this technique is being applied to reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) it is generally applicable to any type of rotating equipment, including drivelines, and can be applied to detecting and tracking changes in blade natural frequencies in gas or steam turbines. This technique was first developed on a laboratory scale rotor test bed to investigate shaft cracking detection techniques under controlled conditions. The test bed provided a mechanism to evaluate sensing technologies and algorithm development. For accurate knowledge of the crack characteristics (crack depth and front), a shaft was seeded with a crack which was then propagated using a three-point bending process. Following each crack growth step, the specimen was evaluated using ultrasonic inspection techniques for crack characterization. After inspection, the shaft was inserted in the rotor test bed for analysis of shaft torsional vibration features. Following success in detecting and tracking crack growth on the test bed, this process was then take to a much bigger machine for verification. In the summer of 2004, the Applied Research Laboratory, along with other EPRI team members (Southern Co. and Jeumont Industrie), instrumented a 41% scale reactor coolant pump in Jeumont, France. On this platform, the team successfully detected and tracked a seeded cut through the shaft. The torsional vibration measurement method has demonstrated the ability to reliably detect changes in the first natural shaft frequency in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 Hz. This technique shows the potential to enable online structural health diagnostics and ultimately prevent shaft or even possibly blade failure due to crack growth","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-12 March 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559672/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8957605","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"5-12 March 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1559672/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Non-Intrusive Technique f or On-Line Shaft Crack Detection a nd Tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Non-Intrusive Technique f or On-Line Shaft Crack Detection a nd Tracking","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"01559672.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064772S","chronDate":"5-12 March 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10432","isNumber":"33126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10432","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33126","articleId":"1559672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559688,"authors":[{"name":"B.G.

An objective method for identifying outliers to be removed is critical. Many automated outlier detection methods are available. However, many are limited by assumptions of a distribution or require upper and lower predefined boundaries in which the data should exist. If there is a known distribution for the data, then using that distribution can aid in finding outliers. Often, a distribution is not known, or the experimenter does not want to make an assumption about a certain distribution. Also, enough information may not exist about a set of data to be able to determine reliable upper and lower boundaries. For these cases, an outlier detection method, using the empirical data and based upon Chebyshev's inequality, was formed. This method allows for detection of multiple outliers, not just one at a time. This method also assumes that the data are independent measurements and that a relatively small percentage of outliers are contained in the data. Chebyshev's inequality gives a bound of what percentage of the data falls outside of k standard deviations from the mean. This calculation holds no assumptions about the distribution of the data. If the data are known to be unimodal without a known distribution, then the method can be improved by using the unimodal Chebyshev inequality. The Chebyshev outlier detection method uses the Chebyshev inequality to calculate upper and lower outlier detection limits. Data values that are not within the range of the upper and lower limits would be considered data outliers. Outliers could be due to erroneous data or could indicate that the data are correct but highly unusual. This algorithm does not ascertain the reason for the outlier; it identifies potential outlier data, allowing for domain experts to investigate the cause","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2005.1559688","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10432/33126/01559688.pdf","startPage":"3814","endPage":"3819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2005.1559688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data outlier detection using the Chebyshev theorem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-12 March 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559688/","displayDocTitle":"Data outlier detection using the Chebyshev theorem","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8957621","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1559688/","conferenceDate":"5-12 March 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data outlier detection using the Chebyshev theorem","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"01559688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079785S","chronDate":"5-12 March 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10432","isNumber":"33126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10432","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"33126","articleId":"1559688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559692,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

The problem that we address in this paper is the discovery of recurring anomalies and relationships between problem reports that may indicate larger systemic problems. We illustrate our techniques on data from discrepancy reports regarding software anomalies in the Space Shuttle. These free text reports are written by a number of different people, thus the emphasis and wording vary considerably. We test four automatic methods of anomaly detection in text that are popular in the current literature on text mining. The first method that we describe is k-means or Gaussian mixture model and its application to the term-document matrix. The second method is the Sammon nonlinear map, which projects high dimensional document vectors into two dimensions for visualization and clustering purposes. The third method is based on an analysis of the results of applying a clustering method, expectation maximization on a mixture of von Mises Fisher distributions that represents each document as a point on a high dimensional sphere. In this space, we perform clustering to obtain sets of similar documents. The results are derived from a new method known as spectral clustering, where vectors from the term-document matrix are embedded in a high dimensional space for clustering. The paper concludes with recommendations regarding the development of an operational text mining system for analysis of problem reports that arise from complex space systems. We also contrast such systems with general purpose text mining systems, illustrating the areas in which this system needs to be specified for the space domain","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/10432/33126/01559692.pdf","startPage":"3853","endPage":"3862","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2005.1559692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2005.1559692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33126","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering recurring anomalies in text reports regarding complex space systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Information analysis","Aerospace testing","Text mining","Functional analysis","Data analysis","Sensor systems","Thermal sensors","Manufacturing processes","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engineering","aircraft maintenance","classification","text analysis","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurring anomalies","text reports","complex space systems","historical maintenance","problem data bases","problem reports","discrepancy reports","software anomalies","Space Shuttle","automatic methods","anomaly detection","text mining","k-means method","Gaussian mixture model","term-document matrix","Sammon nonlinear map","expectation maximization","von Mises Fisher distributions","spectral clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-12 March 2005","displayDocTitle":"Discovering recurring anomalies in text reports regarding complex space systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1559692/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8957625","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","conferenceDate":"5-12 March 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering recurring anomalies in text reports regarding complex space systems","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"01559692.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062486S","chronDate":"5-12 March 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10432","isNumber":"33126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10432","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"33126","articleId":"1559692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559719,"authors":[{"name":"Pen-Shu Yeh","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Pen-Shu Yeh","id":"37287928300"},{"name":"P.

The algorithm adopted in the recommendation consists of a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform of the image, followed by progressive bit-plane coding of the transformed data. The algorithm can provide both lossless and lossy compression, and allows a user to directly control the compressed data volume or the fidelity with which the wavelet-transformed data can be reconstructed. The algorithm is suitable for both frame-based image data and scan-based sensor data, and has applications for near-Earth and deep-space missions. The standard will be accompanied by free software sources on a future Web site. An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation of the compressor is currently under development.

Process variation, noise and spot defects create very costly problems for our industry. Luckily, in the domain of multi-media, there exists a large body of functions where computational results need not always be correct. We show that for many VLSI implementations of signal processing algorithms, such as MPEG and JPEG encoders, a significant proportion of chips having low levels of defects provide erroneous but acceptable results. We introduce the concept of error-tolerance, and mention related issues needed to support this concept, including ways for specifying performance, design techniques that consider yield, test techniques for quantifying erroneous behavior, and finally the issue of marketing. The motivation for this work is to significantly increase the effective yield of a process, encourage the implementation of complex data processing chips, and drastically reduce chip costs.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2005.58","publicationTitle":"8th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"8th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10433/33127/01559770.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2005.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-media applications and imprecise computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2005","displayDocTitle":"Multi-media applications and imprecise computation","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1559770/","accessionNumber":"8761575","publicationDate":"2005","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-media applications and imprecise computation","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01559770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084518S","chronDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10433","isNumber":"33127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10433","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"33127","articleId":"1559770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1559791,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

Consequently, they are an attractive architecture for high-performance computing at a low cost. Nevertheless, it is still not very clear how to exploit all their potential for general-purpose applications. In this work we present a comprehensive study of the performance of an application executing on the GPU. In addition, we analyze the possibility of using the graphics card to extend the life-time of a computer system. In our experiments we compare the execution on a mid-class GPU (NVIDIA GeForce FX 5700LE) with a high-end CPU (Pentium 4 3.2 GHz). The results show that to achieve high speedup with the GPU you need to: (1) format the vectors into two-dimensional arrays; (2) process large data arrays; and (3) perform a considerable amount of operations per data element. Finally, we study the performance when upgrading a low-end system by simply adding a GPU. This solution is cheaper, results in smaller power consumption and achieves higher speedup (8.1x versus 1.3x) than a full upgrade to a new high-end system.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2005.40","startPage":"306","publicationTitle":"8th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"8th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10433/33127/01559819.pdf","endPage":"313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2005.40","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559819/","displayDocTitle":"Exploring graphics processor performance for general purpose applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1559819/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8747376","publicationDate":"2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring graphics processor performance for general purpose applications","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"01559819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051663S","chronDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10433","isNumber":"33127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10433","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"33127","articleId":"1559819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559821,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The traditional approach is based on application of general purpose multipliers. However, performance of multipliers implemented in FPGA architectures does not allow to constructs high performance digital filters. In this paper application of distributed arithmetic is demonstrated. Since in this approach combinational LUT blocks replace general purpose multipliers, it is possible to construct digital filters of very high performance. However LUT blocks can be of considerable size thus advanced synthesis methods have to be used to map them efficiently into FPGA resources. In this paper and application of the functional decomposition based synthesis has been investigated. This method is recognised as the best synthesis method targeted FPGA architectures and allows significant improvements in digital filters implementation.

Via simulations we show that, over frequency selective fading channels, the proposed BP detector achieves a near-optimal performance, even in the presence of the length 4 cycles in the channel factor graph","doi":"10.1109/ICAS-ICNS.2005.29","publicationTitle":"Joint International Conference on Autonomic and Autonomous Systems and International Conference on Networking and Services - (icas-isns'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"Joint International Conference on Autonomic and Autonomous Systems and International Conference on Networking and Services - (icas-isns'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/10434/33128/01559897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAS-ICNS.2005.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33128","startPage":"45","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Belief Propagation over MIMO Frequency Selective Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Belief Propagation over MIMO Frequency Selective Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 Oct. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559897/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 Oct. 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9120630","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1559897/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Belief Propagation over MIMO Frequency Selective Fading Channels","confLoc":"Papeete, France","sourcePdf":"01559897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052622S","chronDate":"23-28 Oct. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10434","isNumber":"33128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10434","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33128","articleId":"1559897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559953,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-hsing Hsu","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Chung-hsing Hsu","id":"37290473300"},{"name":"Wu-chun Feng","affiliation":["Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"lastName":"Wu-chun Feng","id":"37280036100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-59593-061-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1559953","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":615},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Power system reliability","Embedded computing","Portable computers","Energy consumption","Dynamic voltage scaling","Large-scale systems","Mobile computing","Batteries","Government"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Power-Aware Run-Time System for High-Performance Computing","doi":"10.1109/SC.2005.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33129","endPage":"1","publicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10435/33129/01559953.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2005.3","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559953","abstract":"For decades, the high-performance computing (HPC) community has focused on performance, where performance is defined as speed. To achieve better performance per compute node, microprocessor vendors have not only doubled the number of transistors (and speed) every 18-24 months, but they have also doubled the power densities. Consequently, keeping a large-scale HPC system functioning properly requires continual cooling in a largemachine room, thus resulting in substantial operational costs. Furthermore, the increase in power densities has led (in part) to a decrease in system reliability, thus leading to lost productivity. To address these problems, we propose a power-aware algorithm that automatically and transparently adapts its voltage and frequency settings to achieve significant power reduction and energy savings with minimal impact on performance. Specifically, we leverage a commodity technology called \"dynamic voltage and frequency scaling\" to implement our power-aware algorithm in the run-time system of commodity HPC systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1559953/","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Power-Aware Run-Time System for High-Performance Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Power-Aware Run-Time System for High-Performance Computing","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01559953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063022S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10435","isNumber":"33129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10435","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"33129","articleId":"1559953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1559954,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Zhuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ling Zhuo","id":"37281877500"},{"name":"V.K.

Several vendors have developed high performance reconfigurable systems which employ FPGAs for application acceleration. In this paper, we propose a BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library for state-of-the-art reconfigurable systems. We study three data-intensive operations: dot product, matrix-vector multiply and dense matrix multiply. The first two operations are I/O bound, and our designs efficiently utilize the available memory bandwidth in the systems. As these operations require accumulation of sequentially delivered floating-point values, we develop a high performance reduction circuit. This circuit uses only one floating-point adder and buffers of moderate size. For matrix multiply operation, we propose a design which employs a linear array of FPGAs. This design exploits the memory hierarchy in the reconfigurable systems, and has very low memory bandwidth requirements. To illustrate our ideas, we have implemented our designs for Level 2 and Level 3 BLAS on Cray XD1.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2005.31","publicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10435/33129/01559954.pdf","startPage":"2","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2005.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance Linear Algebra Operations on Reconfigurable Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559954/","displayDocTitle":"High Performance Linear Algebra Operations on Reconfigurable Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1559954/","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Performance Linear Algebra Operations on Reconfigurable Systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01559954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056684S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10435","isNumber":"33129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10435","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"33129","articleId":"1559954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559955,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The regularity of the resulting grids may be exploited in such a way that it is no longer necessary to explicitly assemble the global discretization matrix. In particular, given an appropriate input grid, the discretization matrix may be defined implicitly using stencils that are constant for each structured patch. This drastically reduces the amonnt of memory required for the discretization, thus allowing for a much larger problem to be solved.

The cost of future high-bandwidth electronic interconnects mushrooms due to expensive optical transceivers needed between electronic switches. We describe a potentially cheaper and more power-efficient approach to building high-performance interconnects. Through empirical analysis of HPC applications, we find that the bulk of inter-processor communication (barring collectives) is bounded in degree and changes very slowly or never. Thus we propose a two-network interconnect: An Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) network handling long-lived bulk data transfers, using optical switches; and a secondary lower-bandwidth Electronic Packet Switching (EPS) network. An OCS could be significantly cheaper, as it uses fewer optical transceivers than an electronic network. Collectives and transient communication packets traverse the electronic network. We present compiler techniques and dynamic run-time policies, using this two-network interconnect. Simulation results show that our approach provides high performance at low cost.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2005.48","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10435/33129/01559968.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2005.48","publicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","startPage":"16","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Feasibility of Optical Circuit Switching for High Performance Computing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"On the Feasibility of Optical Circuit Switching for High Performance Computing Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559968/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1559968/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Feasibility of Optical Circuit Switching for High Performance Computing Systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01559968.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111908S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10435","isNumber":"33129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10435","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"33129","articleId":"1559968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1559973,"authors":[{"name":"N.

SOAP\u2019s XML-based message format hinders its performance, thus making it unsuitable in high-performance scientific applications. The deserialization of SOAP messages, which includes processing of XML data and conversion of strings to in-memory data types, is the major performance bottleneck in a SOAP message exchange. This paper presents and evaluates a new optimization technique for removing this bottleneck. This technique, called differential deserialization (DDS), exploits the similarities between incoming messages to reduce deserialization time. Differential deserialization is fully SOAPcompliant and requires no changes to a SOAP client. A performance study demonstrates that DDS can result in a significant performance improvement for some Web services.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2005.24","startPage":"21","publicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10435/33129/01559973.pdf","endPage":"21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2005.24","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559973/","displayDocTitle":"Differential Deserialization for Optimized SOAP Performance","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1559973/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Deserialization for Optimized SOAP Performance","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01559973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076034S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10435","isNumber":"33129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10435","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"33129","articleId":"1559973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559976,"authors":[{"name":"F.

This paper presents a distributed breadth- first search (BFS) scheme that scales for random graphs with up to three billion vertices and 30 billion edges. Scalability was tested on IBM BlueGene/L with 32,768 nodes at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Scalability was obtained through a series of optimizations, in particular, those that ensure scalable use of memory. We use 2D (edge) partitioning of the graph instead of conventional 1D (vertex) partitioning to reduce communication overhead. For Poisson random graphs, we show that the expected size of the messages is scalable for both 2D and 1D partitionings. Finally, we have developed efficient collective communication functions for the 3D torus architecture of BlueGene/L that also take advantage of the structure in the problem. The performance and characteristics of the algorithm are measured and reported.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Distributed Parallel Breadth-First Search Algorithm on BlueGene/L","publicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SC.2005.4","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10435/33129/01559977.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2005.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33129","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Distributed Parallel Breadth-First Search Algorithm on BlueGene/L","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1559977/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Distributed Parallel Breadth-First Search Algorithm on BlueGene/L","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01559977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074727S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10435","isNumber":"33129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10435","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"33129","articleId":"1559977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":1559985,"authors":[{"name":"N.

As a result, interest in using powerscalable clusters, where frequency and voltage can be dynamically modified, has increased. On power-scalable clusters, one opportunity for saving energy with little or no loss of performance exists when the computational load is not perfectly balanced. This situation occurs frequently, as balancing load between nodes is one of the long standing problems in parallel and distributed computing. In this paper we present a system called Jitter, which reduces the frequency on nodes that are assigned less computation and therefore have slack time. This saves energy on these nodes, and the goal of Jitter is to attempt to ensure that they arrive \"just in time\" so that they avoid increasing overall execution time. For example, in Aztec, from the ASCI Purple suite, our algorithm uses 8% less energy while increasing execution time by only 2.6%.","doi":"10.1109/SC.2005.39","publicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10435/33129/01559985.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2005.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Just In Time Dynamic Voltage Scaling: Exploiting Inter-Node Slack to Save Energy in MPI Programs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559985/","displayDocTitle":"Just In Time Dynamic Voltage Scaling: Exploiting Inter-Node Slack to Save Energy in MPI Programs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1559985/","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Just In Time Dynamic Voltage Scaling: Exploiting Inter-Node Slack to Save Energy in MPI Programs","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01559985.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074302S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10435","isNumber":"33129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10435","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"33129","articleId":"1559985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559986,"authors":[{"name":"R.

High-performance, power-aware distributed computing reduces power and energy consumption of distributed applications and systems without sacrificing performance. Generally, we use DVS (Dynamic Voltage Scaling) technology now available in high-performance microprocessors to reduce power consumption during parallel application runs when peak CPU performance is not necessary due to load imbalance, communication delays, etc. We propose distributed performance-directed DVS scheduling strategies for use in scalable power-aware HPC clusters. By varying scheduling granularity we can obtain significant energy savings without increasing execution time (36% for FT from NAS PB). We created a software framework to implement and evaluate our various techniques and show performance-directed scheduling consistently saves more energy (nearly 25% for several codes) than comparable approaches with less impact on execution time (< 5%). Additionally, we illustrate the use of energy-delay products to automatically select distributed DVS schedules that meet users\u2019 needs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1559986/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance-constrained Distributed DVS Scheduling for Scientific Applications on Power-aware Clusters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance-constrained Distributed DVS Scheduling for Scientific Applications on Power-aware Clusters","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01559986.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059155S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10435","isNumber":"33129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10435","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"33129","articleId":"1559986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1559988,"authors":[{"name":"F.I.

To complicate matters, the service provider may experience resource uncertainty an inability to get the resources it needs or expects. The result will be sub-optimal choices of which jobs to accept and when to run them, and the service provider may have to pay penalties to its clients.

DDD simulations give rise to inverse problems of determining unknown data from sparse observations. The main difficulty is that the optimality system is a boundary value problem in 4D space-time, even though the forward simulation is an initial value problem. We construct special-purpose parallel multigrid algorithms that exploit the spectral structure of the inverse operator. Experiments on problems of localizing airborne contaminant release from sparse observations in a regional atmospheric transport model demonstrate that 17-million-parameter inversion can be effected at a cost of just 18 forward simulations with high parallel efficiency. On 1024 Alphaserver EV68 processors, the turnaround time is just 29 minutes. Moreover, inverse problems with 135 million parameters - corresponding to 139 billion total space-time unknowns - are solved in less than 5 hours on the same number of processors. These results suggest that ultra-high resolution data-driven inversion can be carried out sufficiently rapidly for simulation-based \"real-time\" hazard assessment.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverse problems","Atmospheric modeling","Biomedical measurements","Geologic measurements","Laboratories","Uncertainty","State estimation","Government","Hazards","Computational modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SC.2005.25","publicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '05: Proceedings of the 2005 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10435/33129/01559995.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=33129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2005.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DYNAMIC DATA-DRIVEN INVERSION FOR TERASCALE SIMULATIONS: REAL-TIME IDENTIFICATION OF AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1559995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DYNAMIC DATA-DRIVEN INVERSION FOR TERASCALE SIMULATIONS: REAL-TIME IDENTIFICATION OF AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1559995/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1559995/","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DYNAMIC DATA-DRIVEN INVERSION FOR TERASCALE SIMULATIONS: REAL-TIME IDENTIFICATION OF AIRBORNE CONTAMINANTS","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"01559995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129544S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"10435","isNumber":"33129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"10435","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"33129","articleId":"1559995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"}]
