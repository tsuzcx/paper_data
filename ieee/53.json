Ultrashort x-ray pulses can be generated by ultrashort, high-intensity laser pulses impinging on a solid target. A major limitation of this method is the low laser energy to x-ray energy conversion efficiency, This is due primarily to the large reflectivity of light on a solid target. A substantial improvement is realized by employing a grating at the surface of the solid. However, this method leaves numerous parameters to be determined in order to establish the most efficient configuration, such as spacing and depth of the grating, as well as angle of incidence and polarization of the impinging light. A simulation procedure using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is being developed to simulate this interaction. This utilizes a three dimensional simulation of a plane wave impinging on a surface with gratings of various sizes and depths. The illuminating plane wave can be generated at arbitrary angles and polarizations. It is also possible to simulate the interactions with various materials. As the laser pulse impinges on the solid, a high density plasma is generated, so while the laser amplitude varies, the dielectric properties of the medium must be dynamically altered.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11384/00530000.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11384","startPage":"220","endPage":"223 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD simulation of high-intensity, ultrashort laser pulses for X-ray generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FDTD simulation of high-intensity, ultrashort laser pulses for X-ray generation","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530000/","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5205155","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD simulation of high-intensity, ultrashort laser pulses for X-ray generation","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530000.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036249S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","articleId":"530000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":530003,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Computing scattering from targets coated with dielectric/magnetic materials is challenging for many computational methods due to the reduced wavelengths of an incident field inside the coating. These smaller wavelengths require finer sampling of the fields and thus more memory and computation time. A technique for implementing this calculation without greatly increased memory requirements or computation times has recently been developed using a finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) code and tested in one-, two- and three-dimensions. The method requires knowledge of the frequency behavior of the complex permittivity and permeability and the thickness of the dielectric coating. The surface impedance at the surface of the coating is computed based on the given information and then approximated using a summation of causal functions. The approximated impedance is Z-Transformed and added to the FDTD code in special update equations for the fields at the surface of the coating. No computations are required inside the coatings, so the FDTD grid can be sized based on the free space wavelength. The result obtained is valid over the entire frequency range of interest assuming that the approximated surface impedance is a good match over the entire range. Comparisons with analytical solutions in one-dimension and measurements in three-dimensions show good agreement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A frequency dependent FDTD surface impedance for scattering from coated PEC targets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11384/00530097.pdf","startPage":"628","endPage":"631 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"A frequency dependent FDTD surface impedance for scattering from coated PEC targets","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5199600","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency dependent FDTD surface impedance for scattering from coated PEC targets","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062159S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","articleId":"530097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":530099,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

The main advantages of this antenna are the simplicity of the element and feed line as well as the compatibility with integrated circuits. On the design of this antenna, a generation of the parallel plate mode has to be taken into account when the antenna is fed by the stripline. We previously reported how to calculate the power of the parallel plate mode by using the FDTD method and showed the probe reduced the parallel plate mode generated from the strip dipole with the window by 6 dB.

When the data have to be processed in the time domain (TD), for example with short pulse excitation, a high dynamic range is necessary to be able to take advantage of both the early and late times parts of the signal. Also there is a need of being able to compute very low observable targets scattering. It is then necessary, in any TD computation method, to get rid of round-off errors which may become significant in the case of sharp, rapidly varying incident pulse excitation. Usually the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) computations are done on the total field by using Yee's algorithm. As the scattered field has to be calculated in the far zone and also because one wishes to avoid spurious reflections of the incident field on the absorbing boundaries, it must exist near the boundary of the volume calculation a sub-volume free of incident field. For this purpose, Mur (l981) and Taflove (1990) have proposed an initialization of the incident field which takes advantage of the fact that the incident field is known analytically everywhere. What is proposed in this paper is a variant of the previous method. The incident field is updated by the Yee's algorithm in exactly the same way as the total field, which eliminates round-off errors and prevents any leakage of the incident pulse out of the inner volume. Furthermore, the incident field is calculated analytically at only one node of the grid which alleviates the computational effort.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient initialization method for FDTD computation of plane wave scattering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11385/00530150.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"851 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"An efficient initialization method for FDTD computation of plane wave scattering","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5182989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient initialization method for FDTD computation of plane wave scattering","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041123S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","citationCount":"1","articleId":"530150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":530161,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Naturally, an integral component of these systems is the portable transceiver handset which allows convenient communication at any remote location. When designing handsets for use in satellite-based systems one technical challenge is the requirement of supplying an antenna which provides circularly polarized radiation over a broad angular range. Novel antenna designs, such as the microstrip patch antenna presented in this paper, must be designed and evaluated if good engineering solutions are to be found. A key consideration in the evaluation of antennas for transceiver handsets is the effect of the operator's biological tissue on the antenna radiation performance. This is particularly true for circularly polarized antennas for satellite networks, where the pattern polarization and shape characteristics may be of critical importance. Therefore, this paper uses a previously reported electromagnetic simulation tool based upon the finite difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm to study the effect of the human body on the handset-mounted circularly polarized patch antenna. Within the FDTD methodology, detailed models of the head and hand are combined with a real-life model of the antenna on the handset to allow investigation of the antenna performance when it radiates in its true operating environment.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11385/00530213.pdf","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1115 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of circularly polarized patch antennas for personal satellite communications including biological effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530213/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of circularly polarized patch antennas for personal satellite communications including biological effects","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5183052","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of circularly polarized patch antennas for personal satellite communications including biological effects","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02604S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","citationCount":"2","articleId":"530213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":530222,"authors":[{"name":"N.T.

Motivation for their development includes the inherent advantages of an approach that employs spatial power combining and spatial amplification. Thus, losses between multistage amplifiers are virtually eliminated. Also due to the spatial combining, the phase of the array is determined by the phase of the incident wave which is then amplified by the planar circuit. This eliminates the need for complex phase shifters and the associated lines for independent element control. Other advantages include the existence of graceful degradation when failures occur. Typically, a unit cell of these planar arrays has been analyzed using quasi-static transmission line approaches. This approach is used due to its simplicity and the easy addition of the port locations required by the active devices. The benefit of a grid amplifier design at high frequency is limited by this approach which may ignore strong mutual coupling or surface waves present at higher frequencies. Based on more conventional periodic array analysis, the method described extended the generalized scattering matrix approach to include the port locations of the device. This allows accurate inclusion of the effects of the mutual coupling between elements, the presence of bias lines, ground planes, and superstrates/substrates. In addition this numerically generated scattering matrix can be combined with the conventional scattering matrix of the device to form a composite matrix of a grid amplifier.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Transmission line matrix methods","Frequency","Phased arrays","Mutual coupling","HEMTs","MODFETs","Circuits","Phase shifters","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["S-matrix theory","microwave amplifiers","power combiners","semiconductor device testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized scattering matrices","unit cell characterization","grid amplifiers","device deembedding","amplifying grid arrays","periodic unit cells","active devices","HEMT","spatial power combining","spatial amplification","multistage amplifiers","incident wave phase","planar circuit","port locations","mutual coupling","surface waves","bias lines","ground planes","superstrates/substrates","composite matrix"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11385/00530255.pdf","startPage":"1288","endPage":"1291 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized scattering matrices for unit cell characterization of grid amplifiers and device de-embedding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized scattering matrices for unit cell characterization of grid amplifiers and device de-embedding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530255/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5188806","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized scattering matrices for unit cell characterization of grid amplifiers and device de-embedding","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036583S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","articleId":"530255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":530256,"authors":[{"name":"Cheh-Ming Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Cheh-Ming Liu","id":"37087261784"},{"name":"E.A.

A second 18-element grid was fabricated, using this theory, with improved stability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Polarization","Capacitors","Transmission lines","Dielectric constant","Inductors","Power amplifiers","Space technology","Dielectric substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterojunction bipolar transistors","microwave power amplifiers","circuit stability","semiconductor device models","gain measurement","circuit oscillations","capacitors","equivalent circuits","microwave oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability model","HBT grid amplifiers","heterojunction bipolar transistor","peak gain","3-dB bandwidth","gain analysis","gain model","measurement","measured patterns","common mode oscillation","lumped capacitor","phase shift","circular function","16-element HBT grid amplifier","18-element grid amplifer","SHF","9.9 GHz","350 MHz","11 dB"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11385/00530256.pdf","startPage":"1292","endPage":"1295 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gain and stability models for HBT grid amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gain and stability models for HBT grid amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530256/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5188807","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gain and stability models for HBT grid amplifiers","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033831S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","citationCount":"8","articleId":"530256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":530259,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

The back-EMF quantity of the PMSM has mechanical information such as the rotor speed and angle in itself. Therefore, without exterior rotational sensors or other mechanical data which include machine inertia, viscous friction, and outer load condition, these essential information for proper PMSM drives can be obtained successfully from only the back-EMF quantity. In this study, with the help of the modern state observer technique for back-EMF estimation, the rotor position as well as the machine speed are estimated strictly and utilized for practical sensorless PMSM drives. Furthermore, introducing the 'angle ambiguity compensation' algorithm, the proposed sensorless scheme has good starting ability and high performance driving characteristics even in the transient state, such as speed fluctuation or speed reversal.

One promising method to implement such a controller is to use neural networks which possess inherent self-learning, nonlinear mapping and fault-tolerant capability. However, a major issue with the application of neural network controllers is the question of how to optimally train for an effective control performance. Unfortunately since there is no systematic and universally effective method available for training, sometimes the performance of a \"trained\" neural network controller turns out to be significantly worse than expected, and much work remains to be done in this area. This paper presents the application of a newly established technique for training neural networks based on plant response, to develop a high performance brushless DC motor servo system where the position control is implemented by a neural network. The system uses a master/slave DSP structure to achieve the fast calculations required to realize the complex control algorithms, and interfaces to the outside world through a low cost 8 bit microprocessor which acts as an I/O front end master. The experimental results confirm the superior performance of neural network controllers and the effectiveness of the proposed master-slave architecture to implement a digital version of such a controller.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1995.530293","pdfPath":"/iel3/4010/11525/00530293.pdf","startPage":"129","endPage":"133 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '95.

The stator flux oriented drive starts at zero speed in indirect vector control mode, transitions to direct vector control mode as the speed develops, and then transitions back to indirect vector control at zero speed. The vector control uses stator flux orientation in both indirect and direct vector control modes with the stator resistance variation compensated by measurement of stator temperature. The problem of integration at low stator frequency is solved by cascaded low pass filters with programmable time constants. The control strategy of the four-quadrant drive has been analyzed, validated by simulation study, and finally evaluated by experimental study on a laboratory 5 HP drive system.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1995.530294","publicationTitle":"IAS '95.

In a practical motor this assumption may not always be correct, due to sub-optimal alignment of magnets, nonuniformity of magnetic material, current sensor nonlinearities and current controller limitations. These factors, together with nonoptimised current references, can lead to high values of torque ripple and copper loss. This paper describes a method of estimating the electromagnetic torque from the rate of change of co-energy with respect to position, thus taking account of mutual torque, reluctance torque and saturation effects. The paper shows how the estimator can be used in a direct torque control scheme. The direct torque controller maximises the torque/copper loss ratio. Implementation of the direct torque controller in a DSP based drive system is described, with steady-state and transient experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the direct torque control scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '95.

Machine parameter variations due to saturation and temperature are included in the algorithm, which is valid for any speed, including zero speed. A simple hardware implementation to estimate the initial rotor position during the machine start-up and the implementation of position estimation algorithm, using a TMS320C25 DSP, is discussed. Because the estimation algorithm needs few instructions, it can easily be implemented in real-time vector control of permanent magnet synchronous drives.

True peak thrust per unit current through slip control is difficult to achieve because the parameters of linear induction machines vary during normal operation. This paper first develops a peak thrust per unit current control law based on the per-phase equivalent circuit for linear induction machines. The algorithm for identification of the variable parameters in induction machines is then presented. Application to an operational linear induction machine (LIM) demonstrates the utility of this algorithm.

Specifically, all inverters generate common mode voltages relative to the earth ground. The voltages provide coupling or bearing currents through motor parasitic capacitances to the rotor iron and then back from the bearings to the grounded stator case. In this paper, a model for bearing currents caused by PWM inverters is proposed. The model is based on transmission line theory which uses an equivalent lumped parameter /spl pi/-network to describe the parasitic coupling phenomenon. The model parameters are then identified by matching the calculated model outputs with those of experimental measurement. The validation of the method is demonstrated by the fact that the model can reproduce all the experimental results obtained on a test motor. An application of this method also gives a motor grounding current model. As the conducted EMI in drive systems is related to the grounding currents, the grounding current model can be used for the analysis of conducted EMI in motor-drive systems.","pdfPath":"/iel3/4010/11525/00530326.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"393 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IAS '95.

In previous work, the speed-related current harmonics have been shown to improve the performance of existing back EMF-based sensorless schemes, since they are parameter-independent and exist at virtually any nonzero speed. Digital filtering, however, requires a minimum data sampling time in order to achieve the desired resolution. The contribution of this paper is to determine the optimal method for accurately extracting the speed-related harmonics in the least amount of time. Several digital signal processing algorithms are investigated, including the fast Fourier transform and other traditional methods, as well as parametric techniques such as linear predictions. Each approach is evaluated on the criteria of accuracy, robustness and computation time given a short data record.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1995.530348","publicationTitle":"IAS '95.

A new theoretical analysis of the interaction between harmonic field components due to static and dynamic rotor eccentricity which previous research has not considered is put forward. The resultant harmonic current components produced in the supply current which are highlighted by the analysis are found to exist experimentally and indeed shown to be a function of the combined effect of both dynamic and static eccentricity.

The rectifier diodes turn on and off at low dv/dt. This results in low switching noise and low switching losses. Diode parasitic capacitances do not adversely affect the circuit operation. The absolute value of di/dt is limited at diode turn-off, reducing the reverse recovery current. The circuit is operated at a low output voltage ripple and, therefore, at a low power loss in the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the filter capacitor. Experimental tests were performed for a rectifier circuit operated at an output power of P/sub O/=60 W, a minimum frequency of f=500 kHz, and an output voltage of V/sub O/=3.3 V. The theoretical and the experimental results are in good agreement. Experimental measurements demonstrate that the rectifier is suitable for high-power density, high-frequency applications that requires low-output voltages and high-currents.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectifiers","Diodes","Circuit testing","Circuit noise","Switching loss","Parasitic capacitance","Low voltage","Paramagnetic resonance","Filters","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","rectifying circuits","circuit testing","power transformers","power semiconductor diodes","power semiconductor switches","switching circuits","equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Class E current-driven center-tapped low dv/dt rectifier","transformer leakage inductance","rectifier diodes","switching noise","switching losses","parasitic capacitances","reverse recovery current","output voltage ripple","equivalent series resistance","power loss","filter capacitor","measurements","applications","60 W","500 kHz","3.3 V"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.1995.530390","publicationTitle":"IAS '95.

Due to the small time constants of the motor circuits, the time to complete one training cycle has to be extremely small. This paper proposes and evaluates a new, fast, on-line training algorithm which is based on the method of random search training, termed the random weight change (RWC) algorithm. Simulation results show that RWC training of an ANN yields performance very much the same as conventional backpropagation training. Unlike backpropagation, however, the RWC method can be implemented in mixed digital/analog hardware, and still have a sufficiently small training cycle time. The paper also proposes a VLSI implementation which one training cycle in as little as 8 /spl mu/sec. Such a fast ANN can identify and control the motor currents within a few milliseconds and thus provide self-tuning of the drive while the ANN has no prior information whatsoever of the connected inverter and motor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530522/","accessionNumber":"5155253","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Identification and control of induction motor stator currents using fast on-line random training of a neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification and control of induction motor stator currents using fast on-line random training of a neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00530522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052414S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4010","citationCount":"9","articleId":"530522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":530523,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

The proposed ANN, the functional polynomial network (FPN), mixes the concept of orthogonal basis functions with the idea of polynomial networks. A combination of orthogonal functions can be used to produce a desired mapping. However, there is no way besides trial and error to choose which orthogonal functions should be selected. Polynomial nets can be used for function approximation, but, it is not easy to set the order of the activation function. The combination of the two concepts produces a very powerful ANN model due to the automatic input selection capability of the polynomial networks. The proposed FPN has been tested for speed control of a DC motor. The results have been compared with the ones provided by an indirect adaptive control scheme based on multilayer perceptrons trained by backpropagation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530523/","accessionNumber":"5155254","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An alternative approach for adaptive real-time control using a nonparametric neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An alternative approach for adaptive real-time control using a nonparametric neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00530523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108106S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4010","citationCount":"1","articleId":"530523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":530525,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This damping function is effective only on the harmonic components of AC input current selectively. Thus steady state waveform distortion and transient oscillation of the input current are reduced by the active damping effects. The active damping function can be realized by feedback control of an LC filter connected to the AC side of the rectifier, and it does not require any additional components in the main circuits, permitting a simple circuit configuration. The control system of the proposed PWM rectifier is analyzed by using a simple block diagram developed in the paper. From the analytical results, the influence of the circuit parameters and control delay on the active damping effects and the stability of the operation is clarified to establish the design method. To confirm the effectiveness of the active damping function, some results of basic experiments are included. As an example of application of the active damping function, the proposed rectifier is applied to reduce the harmonic currents generated by conventional rectifiers operating in parallel with the proposed rectifier. Some experimental results in this application are also included.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A current type PWM rectifier with active damping function","publicationTitle":"IAS '95.

The proposed predictive current regulator achieves: constant switching frequency by using a carrier based space vector voltage PWM switching strategy, minimizes both high and low frequency current errors and can operate with extremely low load inductances of typically <5%. This implies that good spectral performance and spectral separation is maintained at light loads and enables the proposed current regulator to achieve insensitivity to load inductance.

Different switching sequence strategies for vector control are described and a digital scaler method is also presented. The influence of different switching patterns on the output voltage symmetry, current waveform and switching frequency are examined. The results obtained by employing the vector and scalar strategies are compared and a relationship between them is established. This comparison is based on analytical study and is corroborated by the computer simulations and by the experimental results. The vector approach makes it easy to understand and analyse the FSTPI, as well the choice of a PWM pattern. However, similar results may be obtained through the scalar approach, which has a simpler implementation. The experimental results of the use of the FSTPI and digital PWM to control an induction motor are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530611/","accessionNumber":"5155300","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Vector and scalar control of a four switch three phase inverter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector and scalar control of a four switch three phase inverter","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00530611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.206624S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4010","citationCount":"53","articleId":"530611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":530615,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

However, a general hierarchial consensus appears to have emerged from this work which ranks space vector modulation techniques, regular sampled modulation and sine-triangle modulation strategies in decreasing order of merit based on harmonic performance. However, what has not been clearly identified is why space vector modulation should lead to a reduced harmonic current ripple compared to regular sampled modulation, especially since it is straightforward to show that they produce identical low frequency fundamental components. This paper addresses this issue, by showing how it is the placement of the zero space vector component within the carrier interval that determines the harmonic performance of the modulation strategy, rather than any intrinsic differences between the various methods of calculating the switching instances.","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '95.

The series active filter is rated 35 kVA-4% of the load kVA, and is controlled by a synchronous reference frame based controller to act as a harmonic isolator between the supply and load. This paper discusses the basic synchronous reference frame controller structure and addresses its operation under nonunity controller loop gain conditions. Design trade-offs and implementation issues of the synchronous reference frame controller are discussed. Operation of the hybrid series active filter system under off-tuned passive filter conditions and its impact on the performance of the synchronous reference frame based controller is experimentally evaluated. Effectiveness of the series active filter to provide harmonic damping and the use of simpler and low cost power factor correction capacitors as passive filters, is demonstrated by laboratory experimental results. Field installation and laboratory experimental results demonstrate the practical viability of the synchronous reference frame based controller for hybrid series active filter to provide harmonic isolation of nonlinear loads and to comply with IEEE 519 recommended harmonic standards.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1995.530625","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '95.

With multilevel inverters, it is possible to realize low distortion voltage waveforms and keep losses low using suitable switching schemes.

In this paper, the fault modes of a multilevel inverter are investigated with special emphasis on the five level inverter. The main focus or the paper is on device failure and the corresponding impact on the operating conditions and resulting stresses. The presence of redundant states offers the possibility of continuing operation with inferior bus and device utilization following a fault. Failure of some devices is more critical than the failure of others, thereby emphasizing the need for adding redundant devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Oct 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5162153","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault protection in a multilevel inverter implementation of a static condenser","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault protection in a multilevel inverter implementation of a static condenser","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00530628.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028312S","chronDate":"8-12 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4010","citationCount":"31","articleId":"530628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":530635,"authors":[{"name":"Kunrong Wang","affiliation":["Virginia Power Electronics Center, The Bradley Department of Electrical Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Kunrong Wang","id":"37087183878"},{"name":"Yimin Jiang","affiliation":["Virginia Power Electronics Center, The Bradley Department of Electrical Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Yimin Jiang","id":"37087375294"},{"name":"S.

Adding an active switch on the DC-rail makes the implementation of the ZVT and ZCT as easy as in a single-ended DC/DC power converter, while true pulse-width-modulation (PWM) operation is achieved by a modified space-vector modulation. As a result, these inverters can run at much higher switching frequencies than conventional hard-switched VSIs, and with higher power density and efficiency. The operation and control strategy are analyzed. Implementation and experimental results of a prototype DC-rail ZVT VSI, which is rated at 15 kVA and run at a switching frequency of 62.5 kHz, are presented. The measured efficiency with static loads reaches 93% under the input voltage of 400 V.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1995.530635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1995.530635","startPage":"2610","endPage":"2617 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '95.

Many facilities are installing ASDs to improve the efficiency of their processes and to increase the control of their processes. While the effects of ASDs on the power system are well known, many engineers and systems integrators are not aware of the effects that ASDs can have on the motor that is driven by the drive. This paper describes the techniques used to measure, analyze, and simulate the problems associated with the use of PWM ASDs to drive induction motors. Measures to mitigate these problems are also discussed.

In serial connections of IGBTs, a suitable voltage balance must be guaranteed either at steady state or during switching transients in order to avoid damaging overvoltages. In the present paper, a new approach is proposed in order to equalize the voltage distribution between series connected IGBTs during turn-off transients by controlling the gate capacitance charge profile. The main advantages of such an approach consist in avoiding the use of passive components on the power side and in working exclusively on the gate driving signals. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by simulation and experimental tests.","publicationTitle":"IAS '95.

We believe that such myopic solutions-focussing exclusively on a particular client or set of clients-are likely to have a limited impact. Instead, we offer a solution that allows the replication of information to be done on a global supply/demand basis. We propose a hierarchical demand-based replication strategy that optimally disseminates information from its producer to servers that are closer to its consumers. The level of dissemination depends on the relative popularity of documents, and on the expected reduction in traffic that results from such dissemination. We used extensive HTTP logs to validate an analytical model of server popularity and file access profiles. Using that model we show that by disseminating the most popular documents on servers closer to clients, network traffic could be reduced considerably, while servers are load-balanced. We argue that this process could be generalized to provide for an automated server-based information dissemination protocol that will be more effective in reducing both network bandwidth and document retrieval times than client-based caching protocols.","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1995.530703","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.Seventh IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.Seventh IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4038/11584/00530703.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1995.530703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demand-based document dissemination to reduce traffic and balance load in distributed information systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530703/","displayDocTitle":"Demand-based document dissemination to reduce traffic and balance load in distributed information systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5119704","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demand-based document dissemination to reduce traffic and balance load in distributed information systems","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00530703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050943S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4038","citationCount":"38","articleId":"530703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":530706,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tao Yang","id":"37278086600"},{"name":"O.H.

Our main concern is to construct an algorithm which can be integrated in distributed runtime systems like PVM or MPI. Existing methods are often not adjustable to different architecture- and application-demands. Even if they are, the adjustment has to be done manually via time-consuming experiments. A universally applicable strategy has to adjust its parameters automatically according to hardware- and application-characteristics. We concentrate on bidding-algorithms which check the load of K randomly selected processors before placing a task. The analysis of this method is based on a model which allows predicting the behavior of the scheduler. Especially for a large number n of processes it is possible to show that the scheduling behaviour becomes independent of n. As a result we derive optimal K-values for different classes of application/architecture-characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate values of K which guarantee certain execution-times of the application with a given probability.","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1995.530718","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.Seventh IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.Seventh IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4038/11584/00530718.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1995.530718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards developing universal dynamic mapping algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530718/","displayDocTitle":"Towards developing universal dynamic mapping algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5119623","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards developing universal dynamic mapping algorithms","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00530718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043508S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4038","citationCount":"9","articleId":"530718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":530726,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In addition to giving user accesses a higher non-preemptive priority over track reads for rebuild, we consider: (i) the read redirection option; (ii) split-seek option, i.e., allowing user requests to preempt track reads after a seek is completed; (iii) the split-latency/transfer option, i.e., allowing user requests to preempt track reads, Simulation results show that for lower disk utilizations the split-latency/transfer option is desirable in that it reduces response time, while not increasing rebuild time considerably. At higher disk utilizations the response time attained by the split-latency transfer option is comparable to that attained by less preemptive options with shorter rebuild times. A new metric, excess cumulative response time, is defined to compare the efficiency of rebuild options.","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1995.530726","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.Seventh IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.Seventh IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4038/11584/00530726.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1995.530726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11584","startPage":"511","endPage":"518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rebuild options in RAID5 disk arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rebuild options in RAID5 disk arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530726/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5119631","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rebuild options in RAID5 disk arrays","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00530726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028592S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4038","citationCount":"7","articleId":"530726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":530742,"authors":[{"name":"Pai-Chou Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Pai-Chou Wang","id":"37351017200"},{"name":"W.

It can provide more multiple paths than the related previous networks between an input/output pair of a network by adding extra links between switching elements in the same stage and extending the self-routing scheme of the banyan network using the topological properties of the banyan network, which are discovered in this paper. Our routing scheme is as simple as that of the banyan network, which is based on the topological relationships among the switching elements (SEs) in the same stage. We show that the SEs in the same stage are arranged regularly, in other words, each stage of the banyan network is constructed with sequences of a cyclic group of SEs, so we can use not only the inter-stage relationships as the banyan network, but also intra-stage relationships among all switching elements for our scheme. We present an algebraic proof to show the correctness of this routing scheme, and an analytic reliability analysis to provide quantitative comparisons with other networks, which shows that the new network is more reliable than the banyan network and other augmented MINs.","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1995.530750","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.Seventh IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.Seventh IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4038/11584/00530750.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1995.530750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"The cyclic banyan network: a fault tolerant multistage interconnection network with the fully-adaptive self-routing","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 1995","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5119656","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530750/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The cyclic banyan network: a fault tolerant multistage interconnection network with the fully-adaptive self-routing","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00530750.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034122S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4038","citationCount":"17","articleId":"530750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":530759,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

Major results of the study are as follows: (i) interference initiating from the pilot tone reduces the 1st percentile of the speech channel's C/I, which offsets the improvements resulting from coherent combining capabilities; for the 10th percentile of C/I distribution, overall improvements resulting from the pilot transmission are 1 dB. (ii) With a pilot channel transmission in the forward link, the slope of the \"C/I percentile\" versus \"number of active mobiles\" curve is -2 dB/octave.

Thus, adequate guidelines for radio port placement are needed to ensure satisfactory performance at the lowest cost. These guidelines must be derived from a large body of site-specific propagation data. However, collecting a statistically significant database through measurements is a daunting task. Alternatively, this database can be generated by using propagation models, validated by measurements. Several models exist for the statistical characterization of microwave propagation within buildings, However, statistical models do not provide site-specific information. We propose a hybrid model in which ray tracing is used to predict, at any given location, the local mean of the received power and the delay profile. Variations about the mean values can then be captured via a statistical description matched to the local environment. We describe an efficient 3-D ray tracing algorithm which accounts for all (transmitted as well as reflected) rays reaching the receiver location after an arbitrary number of reflections. We include the effects of the angle of incidence, the material dielectric constant and the antenna patterns. The predicted values for the local means of the received power are then compared against measurements to establish the accuracy of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.530781","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11645/00530781.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"144 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.530781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray tracing prediction of indoor radio propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530781/","displayDocTitle":"Ray tracing prediction of indoor radio propagation","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5137471","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray tracing prediction of indoor radio propagation","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00530781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044204S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"21","articleId":"530781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":530788,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Minimum-mean-square-error linear block estimation (MMSE-LBE) is applied in combination with decision feedback. Due to relatively low computational complexity of the LBE algorithm a large number of transmitted symbols can be reliably and cost effectively estimated simultaneously in a first detection stage. Since in the second stage the number of 'unknown' symbols is significantly reduced, the performance of MMSE-LBE is noticeable increased.

To reduce the amount of computation of both BDE and SDC for 16 QAM, this paper proposes a tap gain interpolation scheme, new selection schemes of both the equalizing direction of the BDE and the selection of diversity branch. Using these techniques, a 16 QAM/time division multiple access (TDMA) system with 448 ksymbol/s is designed. The system performance is evaluated by computer simulation, assuming a maximum delay of 13 msec. The results confirm that the proposed system is effective and also simple for high-speed data transmission in land mobile communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11645/00530796.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"224 vol.1","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.530796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.530796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11645","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System design on wide-band 16 QAM/TDMA for land mobile communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Time division multiple access","Decision feedback equalizers","Diversity reception","Data communication","Frequency-selective fading channels","Interpolation","System performance","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["16 QAM/TDMA","wideband transmission","land mobile communication","decision feedback equalization","DFE","quadrature amplitude modulation","frequency-selective fading channels","bidirectional equalization","space diversity combining","high-spectral-efficiency","high-quality data transmission","complexity reduction","tap gain interpolation scheme","time division multiple access","system performance","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","displayDocTitle":"System design on wide-band 16 QAM/TDMA for land mobile communications","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5143817","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System design on wide-band 16 QAM/TDMA for land mobile communications","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00530796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035496S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","articleId":"530796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":530797,"authors":[{"name":"I.

OQPSK signals can be demodulated either by a parallel or a serial receiver structure. Both types of receiver structures are examined. The considered digital receivers operate on samples of the complex envelope of the received signal, taken by a free running clock which is not synchronized to the transmitter clock. The synchronized samples necessary for the carrier synchronization algorithm are computed by interpolating between the available non-synchronized samples. Because of finite memory, interpolation is non-ideal; hence, some amount of distortion is introduced, which affects not only the performance of the decision device but also the carrier synchronizer. By means of theoretical analysis, the authors investigate the tracking performance of a specific decision-directed feedback carrier synchronizer, assuming interpolation of orders zero, one and two.","doi":"10.1109/WNCMF.1994.530821","publicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","displayPublicationTitle":"5th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications, Wireless Networks - Catching the Mobile Future.","pdfPath":"/iel2/4069/11645/00530821.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNCMF.1994.530821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11645","startPage":"348","endPage":"352 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of non-ideal interpolation on OQPSK carrier synchronization performance in digital modems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The effect of non-ideal interpolation on OQPSK carrier synchronization performance in digital modems","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530821/","conferenceDate":"18-23 Sept. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"5143842","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of non-ideal interpolation on OQPSK carrier synchronization performance in digital modems","confLoc":"The Hague, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00530821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03417S","chronDate":"18-23 Sep 1994","isNumber":"11645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4069","citationCount":"1","articleId":"530821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":530826,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In this paper, the implementation of the equivalent current sources in the FDTD method to model the interaction of three-terminal active devices and electromagnetic fields is investigated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD analysis of active circuits with equivalent current source approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11386/00530863.pdf","startPage":"1510","endPage":"1513 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"FDTD analysis of active circuits with equivalent current source approach","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5176830","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD analysis of active circuits with equivalent current source approach","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040208S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","citationCount":"9","articleId":"530863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":530883,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

In this work, we present a hybrid technique to compute the generalized scattering matrix (GSM) of a metal sheet perforated periodically with arbitrarily shaped apertures. The GSM can be used as a building block to analyze multilayer FSS with different geometries, by cascade connection. The GSM of each periodic surface can be computed by the most efficient technique, and then, they are combined in the cascade process. The technique is based on FEM and cascade of GSM, but FEM is only used to compute the modes at the irregular shape aperture, considered as a short length of waveguide. This approach takes into account the real thickness of the metal sheet. The numerical modes are computed only once, and then they are used in a modified mode matching technique, in order to reduce the intensive computation of FEM. For canonical apertures (rectangular, circular or coaxial) in a metal screen the GSM is obtained directly by mode matching (MM).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of frequency selective surfaces with arbitrarily shaped apertures by finite element method and generalized scattering matrix","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530895","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11386/00530895.pdf","startPage":"1644","endPage":"1647 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11386","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530895/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of frequency selective surfaces with arbitrarily shaped apertures by finite element method and generalized scattering matrix","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5176846","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of frequency selective surfaces with arbitrarily shaped apertures by finite element method and generalized scattering matrix","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069536S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","citationCount":"8","articleId":"530895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":530942,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A way to cut the costs is to make more efficient feed networks. One efficient feed network for a low sidelobe array consists of amplitude tapering at the subarray level while keeping the individual elements in the subarray uniformly weighted. In this way, subarrays could be mass produced and tested. Unfortunately, grating lobes ruin the low sidelobes in the far field pattern. An improvement to this approach is to find an amplitude taper that is constant for each subarray. Thus, all the elements in a subarray are tapered, but the taper is the same (or a mirror image) for each subarray. This approach yielded excellent results for a linear array. This paper improves the previous approach by using a genetic algorithm to design the amplitude tapers for both the elements in the subarrays and the subarray outputs for linear and planar arrays. Because genetic algorithms can optimize a large number of parameters, both linear and planar subarrayed antennas can be optimized.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5188857","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of subarray amplitude tapers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of subarray amplitude tapers","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023606S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","citationCount":"9","articleId":"530942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":530945,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This is known as the infinite sample criteria. In conjunction with our ongoing research activities in the area of microwave processing of materials, we have developed a metallized ceramic coaxial probe for broadband, high-temperature dielectric properties measurements. We have also developed a method of using the metallized ceramic probe in conjunction with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical methods to make dielectric properties measurements on thin samples. The method is described and results are given to show the validity of the measurement procedure. Results from 2.5 mm thick Zirconia and 5 mm Teflon samples are accurate, and the developed measurement procedure is therefore promising. Results from error analysis calculations are also presented to help guide the successful implementation of the measurement procedure.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11387/00530945.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11387","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1847 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thin sample dielectric properties measurement using open-ended coaxial probes and FDTD calculations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Thin sample dielectric properties measurement using open-ended coaxial probes and FDTD calculations","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530945/","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5188860","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thin sample dielectric properties measurement using open-ended coaxial probes and FDTD calculations","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530945.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032537S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","citationCount":"1","articleId":"530945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":530950,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

The 2-D ray tracing method outlined is a simple and efficient means of calculating the statistical properties of a simple rectangular room. The results can also be seen to lend themselves to a generalization to more complex spaces thus giving an insight into the methods of propagation in enclosed rooms. The effect of wall parameters on the propagation of radio waves in an enclosed space has been documented previously. The 2D ray tracing program is used to vary the parameters of a standard room over a large range to show the relation between room statistics and these variables. A second parameter documented in the literature is the sector averaged signal strength which is also modeled using the simulation program developed. A final effect studied is that of the clustering of individual rays arriving at the receiver. This effect is shown to be replicated by the ray tracing method and mirrors the experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","pdfPath":"/iel3/3934/11387/00530973.pdf","startPage":"1948","endPage":"1951 vol.4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium. 1995 Digest","doi":"10.1109/APS.1995.530973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1995.530973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11387","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=530973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2-D ray tracing model for the characterization of spatial and time-domain properties of the indoor propagation channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Ray tracing","Reflection","Radio transmitters","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication","Communications technology","Statistics","Mirrors","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","radiowave propagation","time-domain analysis","statistical analysis","ray tracing","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor propagation channel","2-D ray tracing model","time-domain properties","spatial-domain properties","wireless communications","2-D ray tracing algorithm","statistical properties","rectangular room","enclosed rooms","wall parameters","radiowave propagation","room statistics","sector averaged signal strength","simulation program","receiver","rays clustering","ray tracing method","experimental results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","displayDocTitle":"A 2-D ray tracing model for the characterization of spatial and time-domain properties of the indoor propagation channel","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5188887","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2-D ray tracing model for the characterization of spatial and time-domain properties of the indoor propagation channel","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070237S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","citationCount":"3","articleId":"530973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":530977,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Specifically, the low cost emphasis in many modern wireless networks often places severe constraints on the acceptable level of transceiver processing circuitry complexity. Available transmitter power is also often at a premium in these modern networks. The solution to the design problem therefore usually requires significant optimization coupled with network simulation. The paper considers the synthesis of a 2-D network of N transceiver nodes with a known spatial distribution using a genetic algorithm optimization method. Each of the nodes consists of a relatively simple a transceiver (antennas, a receiver and a transmitter) in which only limited adjustments of antenna pattern and transmission power level are available. The goal of the optimization is to maximize nodal signal to noise ratios (SNR) while minimizing the transmitter power levels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/530977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5188891","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm optimization of wireless communication networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm optimization of wireless communication networks","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00530977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030795S","chronDate":"18-23 June 1995","isNumber":"11387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3934","citationCount":"10","articleId":"530977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":531005,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The j/sup th/ group detector uses the decisions from the previous j-1 group detectors and cancels the inter-user interference from those users before it makes joint decisions for the j/sup th/ group. This successive interference cancellation scheme was introduced by M.K. Varasani (see IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol.41, no.4, July, 1995) for the Gaussian CDMA channel. This paper consists of extending that idea to the frequency-selective Rayleigh fading (FSRF) CDMA channel. The two group detectors (I and II) for the FSRF-CDMA channel are considered as the basic building blocks. The resulting sequential group detectors can be regarded as members of two distinct classes (each class parametrized by the ordered partition) of multiuser detectors that satisfy a wide range of complexity constraints. A succinct indicator of the average BER over high SNR regions for the FSRF-CDMA channel is defined via the asymptotic efficiency. In this work, upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic efficiency for the two sequential group detectors are derived. Minimax criteria under which these detectors are optimal are specified. A numerical example illustrates the vast improvements achievable by the sequential group detector based on the group detector II.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1995.531127","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/4005/11520/00531127.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1995.531127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11520","startPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Successive cancellation in fading multipath CDMA channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=531127","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Successive cancellation in fading multipath CDMA channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/531127/","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 1995","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5267348","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Successive cancellation in fading multipath CDMA channels","confLoc":"Whistler, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00531127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028018S","chronDate":"17-22 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4005","citationCount":"1","articleId":"531127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":531128,"authors":[{"name":"N.B.

This approach does not account for unmodeled dynamics, however, since it assumes precise knowledge of the plant order. In this paper, singular perturbation arguments are employed to show robustness to unmodeled dynamics at the plant input.

The lead-lag controller values are analytically calculated by equating two characteristic equations: one is formed from desired root locations the authors specify based on their design criteria, and another one is formed from a nominal control structure. Thus the calculation of values of controllers are so straight forward that one can readily generate a lead-lag controller to satisfy given specifications.

The synaptic weights of the networks are adjusted according to the generalized adaline weight adaptation algorithm. The duration of the general learning was 500 s, and no measurements were acquired. Computer simulation was carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in tasks involving lane keeping on a curved roadway at different speeds, gusting side wind, and an obstacle-avoidance maneuver. The results showed that the system displayed good driving performance, and was capable of reproducing the steering performance of human driver.

The paper identifies significant non-linearities occurring in the dynamics of the distillation column and also demonstrates the failings of a linear model based control scheme under such conditions. Four controllers are compared including two PI controllers, linear MBPC and neural network MBPC. The resultant controllers where tested for disturbance rejection, setpoint response and closed-loop control. In each case the neural network MBPC controller outperformed the other controllers by at least 25% on an integral square error test. The linear MBPC controller had double the standard deviation about setpoint achieved by the neural network. The objective of the control scheme was to control column pressure as tightly as possible but with minimal control action so that other column parameters (e.g. product composition) were not unduly disturbed at the expense of pressure control. The neural network controller outperformed the other controllers on both counts.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.531384","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11352/00531384.pdf","startPage":"2312","endPage":"2316 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.531384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a model based predictive control scheme to a distillation column using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/531384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Application of a model based predictive control scheme to a distillation column using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5058173","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a model based predictive control scheme to a distillation column using neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00531384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036069S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"3","articleId":"531384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":531404,"authors":[{"name":"Jiann-Shiou Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Duluth, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Jiann-Shiou Yang","id":"37087169052"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2445-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"531404","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Chemical reactors","Sampling methods","Riccati equations","Control systems","Damping","Design engineering","Three-term control","Robust control","Lyapunov method"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampled data systems","stability","three-term control","chemical technology","process control","chemical reactions","chemical industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability","cyclic-rate sampled-data systems","chemical reactor system","parameter plane method","PID control","PID gains","sampling period","stirred tank"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=531404","abstract":"The stability study of a cyclic rate, sampled-data, stirred-tank chemical reactor system with a PID control using a parameter plane method is considered.

We preserve the features of the original Shapiro's embedded coder. It is possible to choose a fixed target bit rate, as the information needed to represent an image coded at some rate always contains the needed information for the same image coded at lower rates. Therefore, the decoder can cease decoding the bit stream at any point, simulating an image coded at a lower rate corresponding to the truncated bit stream. We also introduce some perceptive improvements by adopting different (more regular) filters with respect to the original QMF pyramid filters proposed by Simoncelli, Hingorani et al.

The proposed method consists of two procedures: an error correction-based learning procedure, and an additional learning procedure. The error correction-based learning procedure adjusts the grade of certainty of each fuzzy rule by its classification performance. That is, when a pattern is misclassified by a particular fuzzy rule, the grade of certainty of that rule is decreased. On the contrary, when a pattern is correctly classified, the grade of certainty is increased. Because the error correction-based learning procedure is not meaningful after all the given patterns are correctly classified, we cannot adjust a classification boundary in such a case. To acquire a more intuitively acceptable boundary, we propose an additional learning procedure. We also propose a method for selecting significant fuzzy rules by pruning unnecessary fuzzy rules, which consists of the error correction-based learning procedure and the concept of forgetting. We can construct a compact fuzzy rule-based classification system with high performance.","doi":"10.1109/91.531768","startPage":"238","endPage":"250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.531768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11208","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/11208/00531768.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy rule-based classification systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/531768/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy rule-based classification systems","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5367520","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fuzzy rule-based classification systems","sourcePdf":"00531768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037801S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"201","articleId":"531768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":531774,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The indirect adaptive scheme allows for the inclusion of a priori knowledge about the plant dynamics in terms of exact mathematical equations or linguistics while the direct adaptive scheme allows for the incorporation of such a priori knowledge in specifying the controller. We prove that with or without such knowledge both adaptive schemes can \"learn\" how to control the plant, provide for bounded internal signals, and achieve asymptotically stable tracking of a reference input. In addition, for the direct adaptive scheme a technique is presented in which linguistic knowledge of the inverse dynamics of the plant may be used to accelerate adaptation. The performance of the indirect and direct adaptive schemes is demonstrated through the longitudinal control of an automobile within an automated lane.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/11208/00531775.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.531775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.531775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=531775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable adaptive control using fuzzy systems and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Fuzzy systems","Neural networks","Programmable control","Vehicle dynamics","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Takagi-Sugeno model","Nonlinear equations","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy systems","adaptive control","continuous time systems","nonlinear systems","asymptotic stability","dynamics","neural nets","fuzzy control","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","fuzzy control","neural networks","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems","continuous-time systems","nonlinear systems","plant dynamics","asymptotic stability","automobile","longitudinal control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/531775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Stable adaptive control using fuzzy systems and neural networks","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5367524","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable adaptive control using fuzzy systems and neural networks","sourcePdf":"00531775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058701S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"459","articleId":"531775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":531778,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Lai Chung","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Fu-Lai Chung","id":"37272182100"},{"name":"Tong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tong Lee","id":"37065429300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"531778","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Associative memory","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy sets","Hardware","Neural networks","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Automatic control","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","content-addressable storage","associative processing","fuzzy set theory","minimax techniques","inference mechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy associative memory","multiple-rule storage capacity","neural network model","fuzzy systems","fuzzy rule-base","FAM matrix","rule modification"]}],"abstract":"Kosko's fuzzy associative memory (FAM) is the very first neural network model for implementing fuzzy systems. Despite its success in various applications, the model suffers from very low storage capacity, i.e., one rule per FAM matrix. A lot of hardware and computations are usually required to implement the model and, hence, it is limited to applications with small fuzzy rule-base. In this paper, the inherent property for storing multiple rules in a FAM matrix is identified. A theorem for perfect recalls of all the stored rules is established and based upon which the hardware and computation requirements of the FAM model can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, we have shown that when the FAM model is generalized to the one with max-bounded-product composition, single matrix implementation is possible if the rule-base is a set of semi-overlapped fuzzy rules. Rule modification schemes are also developed and the inference performance of the established high capacity models is reported through a numerical example.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On fuzzy associative memory with multiple-rule storage capacity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.531778","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/11208/00531778.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.531778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=531778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/531778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"On fuzzy associative memory with multiple-rule storage capacity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5367527","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On fuzzy associative memory with multiple-rule storage capacity","sourcePdf":"00531778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056819S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"47","articleId":"531778","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":531779,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Our error estimation by series association outperforms previous error estimation techniques in providing more accurate confidence information with considerably reduced computational requirements. We demonstrate the extensive usability of our method by applying it to a complicated transient recognition problem of 33 transient scenarios.

The idea is to cast a clustering problem as a minimization problem where the criteria for the optimum segmentation is chosen as the minimization of the Euclidean distance between samples to class centers. In order to generate feasible results, a fuzzy c-means clustering strategy is included in the Hopfield neural network to eliminate the need of finding weighting factors in the energy function, which is formulated and based on a basic concept commonly used in pattern classification, called the \"within-class scatter matrix\" principle. The suggested fuzzy c-means clustering strategy has also been proven to be convergent and to allow the network to learn more effectively than the conventional Hopfield neural network. The fuzzy Hopfield neural network based on the within-class scatter matrix shows the promising results in comparison with the hard c-means method.","doi":"10.1109/23.531787","startPage":"2389","endPage":"2398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/11230/00531787.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.531787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy Hopfield neural network for medical image segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Hopfield neural networks","Biomedical imaging","Image segmentation","Image edge detection","X-ray scattering","Image color analysis","Image texture analysis","Computed tomography","Positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical imaging","image segmentation","neural nets","physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy Hopfield neural network","medical image segmentation","unsupervised parallel segmentation","fuzzy clustering","on-line learning","minimization problem","Euclidean distance","weighting factors","energy function","pattern classification","within-class scatter matrix","fuzzy c-means clustering strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/531787/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy Hopfield neural network for medical image segmentation","volume":"43","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5365561","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy Hopfield neural network for medical image segmentation","sourcePdf":"00531787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06104S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"43","articleId":"531787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":531798,"authors":[{"name":"Hsinchun Chen","affiliation":["MIS Department, Karl Ellev Graduate School of Management, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Hsinchun Chen","id":"37066811500"},{"name":"B.

Because of their unique and peculiar needs, image databases cannot be treated in a similar fashion to other types of digital libraries. The contextual dependencies present in images, and the complex nature of two-dimensional image data make the representation issues more difficult for image databases. An invariant representation of an image is still an open research issue. For these reasons, it is difficult to find a universal content-based retrieval technique. Current approaches based on shape, texture, and color for indexing image databases have met with limited success. Further, these techniques have not been adequately tested in the presence of noise and distortions. A given application domain offers stronger constraints for improving the retrieval performance. Fingerprint databases are characterized by their large size as well as noisy and distorted query images. Distortions are very common in fingerprint images due to elasticity of the skin. In this paper, a method of indexing large fingerprint image databases is presented. The approach integrates a number of domain-specific high-level features such as pattern class and ridge density at higher levels of the search. At the lowest level, it incorporates elastic structural feature-based matching for indexing the database. With a multilevel indexing approach, we have been able to reduce the search space. The search engine has also been implemented on Splash 2-a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based array processor to obtain near-ASIC level speed of matching. Our approach has been tested on a locally collected test data and on NIST-9, a large fingerprint database available in the public domain.","doi":"10.1109/34.531800","startPage":"799","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/11231/00531800.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.531800","endPage":"813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time matching system for large fingerprint databases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/531800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A real-time matching system for large fingerprint databases","volume":"18","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5365718","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time matching system for large fingerprint databases","sourcePdf":"00531800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056644S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"402","articleId":"531800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":531802,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

The excellent amplitude modulation property of the second subharmonic case with the specific laser used in this work is ascribed to the frequency response characteristics of the device.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.531822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/11228/00531822.pdf","startPage":"1160","endPage":"1162","doi":"10.1109/68.531822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extremely low-amplitude modulation in a subharmonically hybrid mode-locked monolithic semiconductor laser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Extremely low-amplitude modulation in a subharmonically hybrid mode-locked monolithic semiconductor laser","volume":"8","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5366819","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/531822/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extremely low-amplitude modulation in a subharmonically hybrid mode-locked monolithic semiconductor laser","sourcePdf":"00531822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036484S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"13","articleId":"531822","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":531823,"authors":[{"name":"W.

For the first two classes, selecting the channel with the highest signal as the crystal of interaction yields a 22-25% misidentification fraction (MIF) for all reasonable noise fwhm to signal (N/S) ratios (i.e. <0.5 at 511 keV). Algorithms that attempt to correctly position events that undergo forward Compton scatter using only energy information can reduce the MIF to 12%, and can be easily realized with counting statistics limited detectors but can only be achieved with very low noise values for noise limited detectors.

The pinhole collimator was compared to medium and high energy parallel hole collimators. The pinhole collimator demonstrated improved resolution/sensitivity tradeoff compared with the parallel hole collimators over the range of distances relevant to head imaging. In planar point source images the pinhole collimator showed reduced penetration effects although in reconstructed images penetration effects were not apparent for either pinhole or high energy parallel hole collimators. Comparable activity quantitation accuracy was observed with all collimators. The accuracy was dependent on the segmentation threshold and calibration procedure.

This paper demonstrates how fuzzy input variables, fuzzy marking, fuzzy firing sequences, and a global output variable should be defined for use with fuzzy Petri nets. The technique employs two fuzzy input variables (spindle speed and feed rate), throughout the milling operation in order to determine surface roughness. Additionally, a fuzzy Petri net is used with an artificial neural network for the modeling and control of surface roughness. Experimental results illustrate that the technique developed can be of benefit when the cutting tool has suffered damage throughout the milling operation. It also shows how the technique can react when the quality is high, medium, or low.

Levitation force is generated by the superposition of P+2 or P-2 pole magnetic flux with the usual motoring magnetic flux (pole number P). PM synchronous motors have the advantage that the control of rotation and levitation are independent, however, the levitation force is weak. Conversely, induction motors produce a strong levitation force, but their efficiency is poor and the control of rotation and levitation are coupled. This paper introduces an internal permanent magnet (IPM) type bearingless motor which has the merits of strong levitation force and relatively easy control properties. A simple experimental apparatus is made to confirm the properties of the proposed motor. The results obtained are discussed in detail.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=531922","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Levitation","Torque control","Permanent magnets","Synchronous motors","Permanent magnet motors","Force control","Induction motors","Magnetic flux","Induction generators","Synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","machine control","torque control","induction motors","magnetic levitation","magnetic flux","magnetic variables control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internal permanent magnet type bearingless motor","torque control","levitation control","PM synchronous motors","PM induction motors","levitation force","motoring magnetic flux","P-2 pole magnetic flux","P+2 pole magnetic flux"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/11216/00531922.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.531922","doi":"10.1109/87.531922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Levitation and torque control of internal permanent magnet type bearingless motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/531922/","displayDocTitle":"Levitation and torque control of internal permanent magnet type bearingless motor","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5361940","volume":"4","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Levitation and torque control of internal permanent magnet type bearingless motor","sourcePdf":"00531922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058163S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"66","articleId":"531922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":531923,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To avoid this problem we propose a generalized narrow-band notch filter which is inserted into the multivariable feedback without destabilizing the closed loop. The parameters of the generalized notch filter strongly depend on the inverse sensitivity matrix evaluated at rotational speed. This matrix is easily measured a priori and stored in a look-up table. It is shown that a decentralized notch is feasible for weakly gyroscopic rotors. The proposed notch filter approach has advantages in terms of run-time complexity and analytical verification of closed-loop stability.

In this paper the block processing concept is generalized by considering overlapped input and/or output blocks. As an overlapped block digital filter is, in general, a shift-varying system, the conditions for its shift-invariant operation have been developed. These conditions have been exploited to derive computationally efficient shift-invariant block structures. Two types of fast FIR filtering algorithms using the overlapped block filter structures are derived. One is based on the adaptation of fast short-length linear convolution algorithms and the other is based on DFT algorithms. These algorithms not only reduce the computational complexity of filtering operations but also offer modular and parallel structures. Finite wordlength effects of FIR filters implemented using the overlapped block filter structure are also investigated.","doi":"10.1109/82.532005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/11220/00532005.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.532005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11220","startPage":"586","endPage":"596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlapped block digital filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Overlapped block digital filtering","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532005/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5367250","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlapped block digital filtering","sourcePdf":"00532005.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050867S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"28","articleId":"532005","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":532007,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

A p-phase CRN consists of a collection of storage cells divided into p subgroups and a routing procedure controlled by a p-phase clock. During a particular clock phase, charge is routed from a particular subgroup of storage cells into another subgroup. This simple mechanism allows a wide range of electronic functions including image sensing, data storage, signal processing or logic operations. An outline of CRN's modus operandi is first given and their input-output relationship is derived. The main result of the paper is the determination of the class of filters realizable as CRNs. The proof is constructive, so that a procedure for the implementation of a filter of this class can be easily set up as shown in a worked example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","volume":"43","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5367255","displayDocTitle":"On the class of linear filters attainable with charge routing networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the class of linear filters attainable with charge routing networks","sourcePdf":"00532010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027854S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"15","articleId":"532010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":532012,"authors":[{"name":"O.

However, a coplanar waveguide (CPW) on a silicon-terraced silica (STS)-type planar lightwave circuit (PLC)-platform has a large propagation loss compared with one on a conventional ceramic substrate. We discuss the reduction of the propagation loss of a CPW on a PLC-platform. First we prove that this CPW loss originates from an increase of the loss tangent (tan /spl delta/) induced by the thermal donors (TD's) which connect with oxygen in the silicon substrate during the silica deposition process. Second we introduce quenching to eliminate the TD's, and drastically reduce the loss of a CPW on a 30 /spl mu/m-thick silica from 2.7 to 0.6 dB/cm at 10 GHz. This loss value is almost the same as that of a CPW on a ceramic substrate. Moreover we fabricated a LD module using a 50 mm-long improved CPW on a PLC-platform. The small signal frequency response characteristics of this module reveal that the improved CPW can be applied as a cm-order electrical circuit in a 10 Gb/s module. This exhibits that an established electronic circuit technology including a multi-chip module (MCM) for a microwave application can be developed on a PLC-platform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loss reduction in a coplanar waveguide on a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) platform by quenching","doi":"10.1109/50.532021","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.532021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11222","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/11222/00532021.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Loss reduction in a coplanar waveguide on a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) platform by quenching","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5365193","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loss reduction in a coplanar waveguide on a planar lightwave circuit (PLC) platform by quenching","sourcePdf":"00532021.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050097S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","articleId":"532021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":532026,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The NSIP describes a method to implement a two-dimensional (2-D) image sensor array with processing capacity in every pixel. Traditionally, there is a contradiction between high spatial resolution and complex processor elements, In the NSIP concept we have a nondestructive photodiode readout and we can thereby process binary images without loosing gray-scale information. The global image processing is handled by an asynchronous Global Logical Unit. These two features makes it possible to have efficient image processing in a small processor element. Electrical problems such as power consumption and fixed pattern noise are solved. All design is aimed at a 128/spl times/128 pixels NSIP in a 0.8 /spl mu/m double-metal single-poly CMOS process. We have fabricated and measured a 32/spl times/32 pixels NSIP. We also give examples of image processing tasks such as gradient and maximum detection, histogram equalization, and thresholding with hysteresis. In the NSIP concept automatic light adaptivity within a 160 dB range is possible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5373891","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of a focal plane image processor-a realization of the near-sensor image processing concept","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of a focal plane image processor-a realization of the near-sensor image processing concept","sourcePdf":"00532033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047878S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"99","articleId":"532033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":532036,"authors":[{"name":"T.

An efficient method has been derived to allow candidate routes for the nets to be considered simultaneously for compatibility rather than incrementally extending routes or routing one net at a time as in many other techniques. This allows incorporation of accurate models for determining the potential for crosstalk problems during the routing process. MCG incorporates a crosstalk avoidance procedure which facilitates correct-by-design routing in systems susceptible to noise problems. In comparisons with other routers on industrial benchmarks, the MCG router has shown substantial improvement in routing density, number of layers, number of vias, and total interconnect length over routers such as V4R and SLICE. Our test results show up to 18% improvement in via count and up to 33% improvement in the required number of routing layers for these examples over V4R. One of the benchmarks presented contains 37 VHSIC gate arrays, over 7000 nets, and over 14000 pins (pads). Routing at finer pitches with crosstalk avoidance shows a further improvement in interconnect density.","doi":"10.1109/92.532036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/11225/00532036.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.532036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast coupled noise estimation for crosstalk avoidance in the MCG multichip module autorouter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532036/","displayDocTitle":"Fast coupled noise estimation for crosstalk avoidance in the MCG multichip module autorouter","volume":"4","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5373894","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast coupled noise estimation for crosstalk avoidance in the MCG multichip module autorouter","sourcePdf":"00532036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042886S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","articleId":"532036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":532038,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Current conventional method uses wheel speed measurements to estimate the speed of the vehicle. As a result, indication of the vehicle speed becomes erroneous and, thus, unreliable when large slips occur between the wheels and terrain. This paper describes a fuzzy rule-based Kalman filtering technique which employs an additional accelerometer to complement the wheel-based speed sensor, and produce an accurate estimation of the true speed of a vehicle. We use the Kalman filters to deal with the noise and uncertainties in the speed and acceleration models, and fuzzy logic to tune the covariances and reset the initialization of the filter according to slip conditions detected and measurement-estimation condition. Experiments were conducted using an actual vehicle to verify the proposed strategy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Control systems","Wheels","Velocity measurement","Accelerometers","Vehicle dynamics","Kalman filters","Filtering","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road vehicles","velocity measurement","fuzzy logic","Kalman filters","knowledge based systems","acceleration measurement","accelerometers","braking","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absolute vehicle speed estimation","fuzzy logic","rule-based Kalman filter","vehicle dynamics control systems","anti-lock brake systems","auto-traction systems","accelerometer","wheel-based speed sensor","acceleration models"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.532084","startPage":"3086","endPage":"3090 vol.5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11354/00532084.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.532084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of absolute vehicle speed using fuzzy logic rule-based Kalman filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of absolute vehicle speed using fuzzy logic rule-based Kalman filter","accessionNumber":"5080531","publicationDate":"1995","isConference":true,"volume":"5","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of absolute vehicle speed using fuzzy logic rule-based Kalman filter","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027308S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"40","articleId":"532084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":532117,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The architecture provides many benefits compared with special-purpose approaches, including heterogeneity, reuse of application and system code, and sharing of resources. The architecture also poses new challenges to both computer system implementers and users. First, traditional local-area networks do not have enough bandwidth and create a communication bottleneck, thus seriously limiting the set of applications that can be run effectively. Second, programmers have to deal with large bodies of code distributed over a variety of architectures, and work in an environment where both the network and nodes are shared with other users. Our experience in the Nectar project shows that it is possible to overcome these problems. We show how networks based on high-speed crossbar switches and efficient protocol implementations can support high bandwidth and low latency communication while still enjoying the flexibility of general networks, and we use three applications to demonstrate that network-based multicomputers are a practical architecture. We also show how the network traffic generated by this new class of applications poses severe requirements for networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/11226/00532117.pdf","startPage":"861","endPage":"875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/71.532117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.532117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11226","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532117","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-based multicomputers: a practical supercomputer architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supercomputers","Computer architecture","Application software","Bandwidth","Local area networks","Programming profession","Switches","Communication switching","Protocols","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor interconnection networks","parallel architectures","distributed processing","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-based multicomputers","supercomputer architecture","heterogeneity","reuse of application code","system code","resources sharing","Nectar project","high-speed crossbar switches","protocol implementations","low latency communication","network traffic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Network-based multicomputers: a practical supercomputer architecture","volume":"7","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5367072","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-based multicomputers: a practical supercomputer architecture","sourcePdf":"00532117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073559S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"6","articleId":"532117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":532121,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

Experiments conducted in a surrounding lossy saline tank, demonstrate that simultaneous recovery of both the real and imaginary components of the electrical property distribution is possible using absolute imaging procedures over a frequency range of 300-700 MHz. Further, image reconstructions of embedded tissue-equivalent targets are found to be quantitative not only with respect to geometrical factors such as object size and location but also electrical composition. Quantitative assessments based on full-width half-height criteria reveal that errors in diameter estimates of reconstructed targets are less than 10 mm in all cases, whereas, positioning errors are less than 1 mm in single object experiments but degrade to 4-10 mm when multiple targets are present. Recovery of actual electrical properties is found to be frequency dependent for the real and imaginary components with background values being typically within 10-20% of their correct size and embedded object having similar accuracies as a percentage of the electrical contrast, although errors as high as 50% can occur. The quantitative evaluation of imaging performance has revealed potential advantages in a two-tiered receiver antenna configuration whose measured field values are more sensitive to target region changes than the typical tomographic type of approach which uses reception sites around the full target region perimeter. This measurement strategy has important implications for both the image reconstruction algorithm where there is a premium on minimizing problem size without sacrificing image quality and the hardware system design which seeks to economize on the amount of measured data required for quantitative image reconstruction while maximizing its sensitivity to target perturbations.","doi":"10.1109/10.532122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/11227/00532122.pdf","startPage":"878","endPage":"890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.532122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave imaging for tissue assessment: initial evaluation in multitarget tissue-equivalent phantoms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532122/","displayDocTitle":"Microwave imaging for tissue assessment: initial evaluation in multitarget tissue-equivalent phantoms","volume":"43","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5371714","pubMedId":"9214803","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave imaging for tissue assessment: initial evaluation in multitarget tissue-equivalent phantoms","sourcePdf":"00532122.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051242S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"104","articleId":"532122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":532124,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

It is hypothesized, that in a clinical setting the normal myofiber architecture in the left ventricular wall is structured as a matrix of cylindrical scatterers whose orientation and spatial distribution vary according to two different statistical distribution laws: (1) a Gaussian law to approximate parametric angular myofiber variability at each site within the myocardial wall; (2) a gamma distribution law to describe parametric regularity in scatterer interdistance. In the model, the effect of the angle of insonification with respect to the alignment of myofibers on ultrasound backscatter was considered. The slope of the power spectral density (PSD) evaluated within the echocardiographic transducer bandwidth has been used as a ultrasonic tissue characterization parameter. The model has been tested by computer simulation and in vitro measurements on myocardial pig tissue specimens. The concordance between experimental and simulated results confirms that the model accounts for the process underlying the echo formation from normal myocardium. Moreover, it provides a simple method of simulation which can be easily implemented and used for the assessment of pathologic alterations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5371716","pubMedId":"9214805","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A model of ultrasound backscatter for the assessment of myocardial tissue structure and architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model of ultrasound backscatter for the assessment of myocardial tissue structure and architecture","sourcePdf":"00532124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059291S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"16","articleId":"532124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":532129,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

A new photoresist (PR) process, Selective Silane Removal (SSR), was developed and compared to two previously developed techniques which use PR and laser patterning. The grid patterns consisted of 27 combinations of path width, length, and intersection (node diameter). The background consisted of squares bounded for the paths. The best neuron patterning was observed on substrates produced by the SSR process where cytophilic aminosilane is uniformly deposited and selectively removed from the background. Controlling water during aminosilane deposition was critical to good neuronal growth and patterning. Oxygen plasma etching of background regions prior to cytophobic phenylsilane binding significantly reduced off-pattern cell growth. Up to 90% of somata grown on these substrates complied to the pattern, and an average of 77% of background regions were free of neurites or cells connected to the pattern. The highest laser energy density, 120 mJ/cm/sup 2/, produced the best compliance on lased substrates, with an average of 35% of background regions free of connected cells and neurites, but considerable variation across the surface. On substrates with excellent patterning, compliance to nodes was found to be dependent on pattern dimensions, with 20-/spl mu/m node diameters and 80-/spl mu/m internodal path lengths increasing compliance.","doi":"10.1109/10.532129","startPage":"944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/11227/00532129.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.532129","endPage":"955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micrometer resolution silane-based patterning of hippocampal neurons: critical variables in photoresist and laser ablation processes for substrate fabrication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Micrometer resolution silane-based patterning of hippocampal neurons: critical variables in photoresist and laser ablation processes for substrate fabrication","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5371721","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","pubMedId":"9214810","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micrometer resolution silane-based patterning of hippocampal neurons: critical variables in photoresist and laser ablation processes for substrate fabrication","sourcePdf":"00532129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043817S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"82","articleId":"532129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":532149,"authors":[{"name":"A. von Jouanne","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, US"],"firstName":"A.","lastName":"von Jouanne","id":"37267926800"},{"name":"P.

Neural networks provide an attractive approach to perform nonparametric identification. However, when identifying low-probability events, the computational overhead associated with training a neural network can become excessive. This is because low-probability events must be adequately represented in the training sample. We present a modified backpropagation training algorithm based on a likelihood ratio weighting function (LRWF) to train the neural network using a much smaller training set than that required using the standard backpropagation algorithm This algorithm is closely related to the importance sampling technique used in digital communication systems to obtain probability of error estimates by using a much smaller number of simulation runs than what is required with standard Monte Carlo simulation. The modified backpropagation technique results in a significant reduction in computational overhead in training the network, resulting from a substantial reduction in the size of the training set required to achieve a given level of performance. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on simulated data for the STI problem in MMW radar.","doi":"10.1109/7.532251","startPage":"898","endPage":"910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/11084/00532251.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.532251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network learning of low-probability events","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Millimeter wave radar","Computer networks","Communication standards","Computational modeling","Millimeter wave communication","Millimeter wave technology","Radar clutter","Parametric statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar target recognition","object recognition","radar clutter","identification","probability","computational complexity","Monte Carlo methods","backpropagation","neural nets","digital simulation","simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","low-probability events","stationary target identification","millimeter wave seeker radars","heavy clutter environment","nonparametric identification","clutter","target","computational overhead","modified backpropagation training algorithm","likelihood ratio weighting function","importance sampling","digital communication","probability of error estimates","Monte Carlo simulation","training","MMW radar","missiles"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1996","displayDocTitle":"Neural network learning of low-probability events","volume":"32","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5344121","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network learning of low-probability events","sourcePdf":"00532251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183573S","chronDate":"July  1996","isNumber":"11084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"13","articleId":"532251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":532252,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We look at invariant tests, i.e., those tests whose performance is independent of the nuisance parameters, like the background noise covariance. Such tests are shown to have the desirable CFAR property. We characterize the class of all such tests by showing that any invariant decision statistic can be written as a function of two basic statistics which are in fact the adaptive matched filter (AMF) statistic and Kelly's generalized likelihood ratio statistic. Further, we establish an optimum test in the limit of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the locally most powerful invariant (LMPI) test. We also derive the bound for the probability of detection of any invariant detector, at a fixed false-alarm rate, and compare the LMPI and the published detectors (Kelly and AMF) to it.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum array detector for a weak signal in unknown noise","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.532252","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/11084/00532252.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.532252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532252/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1996","displayDocTitle":"Optimum array detector for a weak signal in unknown noise","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1996","accessionNumber":"5344122","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum array detector for a weak signal in unknown noise","sourcePdf":"00532252.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044889S","chronDate":"July  1996","isNumber":"11084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"46","articleId":"532252","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":532263,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Then, the design procedures for a high performance drive system using a sliding mode with fuzzy control are explained. Next, the system enhanced by a high performance 32 bit digital signal processor (DSP) and simple hardware circuits is shown. Both the current-loop and speed-loop controllers are executed by the DSP.

A matrix valued function, F(X,Y), is called bilinear if it is linear with respect to each of its arguments, and an inequality of the form, F(X,Y)>0 is called a bilinear matrix inequality. Recently, it was shown that, the static output feedback problem, fixed order controller problem, reduced order H/sup /spl infin// controller design problem, and several other control problems can be formulated as BMIs. The main result of this paper shows that the problem of checking the solvability of BMIs is NP-hard, and hence it is rather unlikely to find a polynomial time algorithm for solving general BMI problems. As an independent result, it is also shown that simultaneous stabilization with static output feedback is an NP-hard problem, namely for given n plants, the problem of checking the existence of a static gain matrix, which stabilizes all of the n plants, is NP-hard.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.532300","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11353/00532300.pdf","startPage":"2525","endPage":"2526 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.532300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the NP-hardness of solving bilinear matrix inequalities and simultaneous stabilization with static output feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532300/","displayDocTitle":"On the NP-hardness of solving bilinear matrix inequalities and simultaneous stabilization with static output feedback","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5064873","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the NP-hardness of solving bilinear matrix inequalities and simultaneous stabilization with static output feedback","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04743S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"132","articleId":"532300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":532318,"authors":[{"name":"W.D.

During network training, the first hidden neuron is used to model the relationship between inputs and outputs whereas other hidden neurons are added sequentially to model the relationship between inputs and model residues. When adding a hidden neuron, its contribution is due to that part of its output vector which is orthogonal to the space spanned by the output vectors of the previous hidden neurons. The Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation technique is used at each training step to form a set of orthogonal bases for the space spanned by the hidden neuron outputs. The optimum hidden layer weights can be obtained through a gradient based optimisation method while the output layer weights can be found using least squares regression. Hidden neurons are added sequentially and the training procedure terminates when the model error is lower than a pre-set level. Using this training method, neurons with mixed types of activation functions and dynamic orders can be incorporated into a single network. Mixed node networks can offer improved performance in terms of representation capabilities and network size. The excellent performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated by application examples.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.532353","startPage":"2767","endPage":"2771 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.532353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11353","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11353/00532353.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic process modelling using locally recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532353/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic process modelling using locally recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"5064910","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic process modelling using locally recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05375S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"3","articleId":"532353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":532354,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA","University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, US"],"lastName":"Hui Ye","id":"37087263637"},{"name":"A.N.

The ALUVs are inexpensive autonomous crab-like robots. They will be deployed in large numbers and will operate without central control and largely independently of one another. Collectively, they will systematically search a craft landing zone, locate mines and obstacles, and destroy them. During Phase I, our Ursula ALUV demonstrated the feasibility of a legged robot walking under water and detecting mines. We are now (in Phase II) developing the Ariel ALUV which is optimized for fast, efficient underwater walking and better mine detection.","doi":"10.1109/AUV.1996.532399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUV.1996.532399","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Symposium on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/3780/11039/00532399.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Symposium on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous legged underwater vehicles for near land warfare","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous legged underwater vehicles for near land warfare","conferenceDate":"2-6 June 1996","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5341486","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532399/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous legged underwater vehicles for near land warfare","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028536S","chronDate":"2-6 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3780","citationCount":"28","articleId":"532399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":532406,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Fuzzy logic controllers are rule-based system. Usually, one incorporate knowledge and experiences of experts into the controller design. In some applications, however, it is difficult to find an experienced expert or it is not so intuitive to incorporate expert's knowledge into the control system, particularly when many constraints are imposed on the controller design. In this study, genetic algorithms are applied to obtain a nearly optimal rule base for the fuzzy logic controller in the sense of fitness. Pool tests are conducted to show the testbed performance in its heading control mode. Our results lead to the conclusion that even in tripled sampling time and under parameter variations and disturbances, the fuzzy logic controller tuned by genetic algorithms can greatly enhance the control robustness, and improve the control quality from performance degeneration.","doi":"10.1109/AUV.1996.532451","startPage":"485","endPage":"489","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Symposium on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Technology","pdfPath":"/iel3/3780/11039/00532451.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Symposium on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUV.1996.532451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of an autonomous underwater vehicle testbed using fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Underwater vehicles","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy logic","Control systems","Genetic algorithms","Logic testing","Knowledge based systems","Optimal control","Sampling methods","Robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine systems","test facilities","fuzzy control","intelligent control","genetic algorithms","motion control","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicle","testbed","fuzzy logic control","genetic algorithms","rule-based system","heading control","robustness","AUV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Control of an autonomous underwater vehicle testbed using fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 June 1996","accessionNumber":"5347346","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of an autonomous underwater vehicle testbed using fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037028S","chronDate":"2-6 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3780","citationCount":"3","articleId":"532451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":532603,"authors":[{"name":"J-C.

A variation on the method is then presented which is guaranteed to yield stable reduced order models even when both input and output weightings are included. The method is a generalisation of Lin and Chiu's (1992) technique and can handle weighting transfer functions which are proper rather than only strictly proper. A frequency response error bound for the proposed technique is also derived which is applicable for proper (including strictly proper) weighting functions.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.532684","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11355/00532684.pdf","startPage":"4004","endPage":"4009 vol.6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.532684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New results on frequency weighted balanced reduction technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532684/","displayDocTitle":"New results on frequency weighted balanced reduction technique","volume":"6","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5064932","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New results on frequency weighted balanced reduction technique","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041759S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"59","articleId":"532684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-13"},{"_id":532711,"authors":[{"name":"H.T.

Idealizing these nonlinearities and using a Lyapunov-based control synthesis leads to a bang-bang control rule which minimizes the rate at which the energy from the disturbance is transmitted to the structure. This control rule is applicable to linear and nonlinear structural systems.

The RBF network consists of Gaussian activation functions and is trained online to learn the inverse dynamics of the CSTR plant with and without parameter variation. Using Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that the control architecture is globally stable for a sector-bounded nonlinearity in the error dynamics. Thus, the control architecture is capable of reducing the tracking error to a small region about zero. The size of this region is dependent on the approximation capabilities of the RBF network. Also, various input signals are investigated for their applicability to on-line function approximation. The simulation results validate the analytical results for stability and convergence in tracking error for a network with a set of fixed basis functions and suggest that stability and reduction in tracking error can be extended to a network with variable basis functions. In addition, the simulation results indicate that neural network consisting of local activation functions can approximate a function on-line provided the input signal sufficiently and frequently covers the input space of interest.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532739/","accessionNumber":"5064987","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On-line control of a nonlinear system using radial basis function neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line control of a nonlinear system using radial basis function neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035069S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"4","articleId":"532739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":532741,"authors":[{"name":"Liming Wu","affiliation":["Research Center for Automation and Control, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Liming Wu","id":"37087530242"},{"name":"Tianyou Chai","affiliation":["Research Center for Automation and Control, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Tianyou Chai","id":"37087164937"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-2445-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"532741","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532741","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete time systems","Neural networks","Control systems","Artificial neural networks","Sufficient conditions","Continuous time systems","Nonlinear control systems","Automation","Automatic control","Control theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","nonlinear control systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoupling problem","nonlinear discrete time systems","neural networks","necessary and sufficient condition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.532741","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11355/00532741.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","startPage":"4275","endPage":"4279 vol.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.532741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupling of a class of nonlinear discrete time systems using neural networks","abstract":"In this paper, the decoupling problem for a class of nonlinear discrete time systems is considered.

The model and control scheme are simulated on a digital computer and the results prove that the feedback control works well for fast load positioning without sway or oscillation.","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11355/00532748.pdf","startPage":"4310","endPage":"4315 vol.6","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.532748","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.532748","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532748","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback control","Cranes","Nonlinear systems","Control systems","Robotics and automation","Nonlinear control systems","Acceleration","Lifting equipment","Civil engineering","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","cranes","materials handling","nonlinear dynamical systems","nonlinear control systems","tracking","position control","velocity control","singularly perturbed systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear feedback control","gantry crane","nonlinear dynamical model","load angle oscillation suppression","nonlinear tracking controller","outer tracking loop","internal oscillatory dynamics","singular perturbation design","fast load positioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532748/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear feedback control of a gantry crane","accessionNumber":"5064996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","volume":"6","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear feedback control of a gantry crane","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06091S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"55","articleId":"532748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":532759,"authors":[{"name":"R.T.

Many conventional robust adaptive schemes can be utilized to control the system. In this paper, we present one novel neural network (NN) method which does not require the robot dynamics to be exactly known. Compared with adaptive control, no linearity in the unknown parameters is needed and no persistency of excitation condition is required. Compared with other NN approaches, our method does not require an off-line \"training phase\". All errors including force, position and weight are guaranteed to be bounded. The main advantage of such a framework is that robustness to parametric uncertainties is achieved without the availability of acceleration and jerk measurement. The complexity of the controller is at the same level as the rigid joint case.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.532781","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11355/00532781.pdf","startPage":"4460","endPage":"4465 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.532781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust force/motion control of flexible-joint robots using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Robust force/motion control of flexible-joint robots using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5065029","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust force/motion control of flexible-joint robots using neural networks","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532781.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055483S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"1","articleId":"532781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":532784,"authors":[{"name":"W.R.

This may result in a large amplitude circular yaw and a severe spiraling of the vehicles center of mass. The presence of a static aerodynamic induced rolling moment may cause the roll rate to lock-in at the critical frequency in which case the severity of this spiraling motion is greatly increased. Both the amplitude and frequency of spiraling generally increase as the missile descends in altitude. The frequency of the motion is in the range 0.5 to 1 Hz which is the range of target weave frequencies most critical for fast-response proportional navigation interceptors. These motions can cause significant miss distance in a conventional proportional navigation guidance system. This paper demonstrates the advantages of using a weave guidance law. The paper shows that an alternative approach to improving interceptor performance is by improving the guidance law used to steer the missile. If the target weave frequency can be estimated the paper shows that the compensated weave guidance law substantially improves system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ACC.1995.532784","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 American Control Conference - ACC'95","pdfPath":"/iel3/3920/11355/00532784.pdf","startPage":"4476","endPage":"4483 vol.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACC.1995.532784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","displayDocTitle":"Interception of spiraling ballistic missiles","volume":"6","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 1995","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5065032","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532784/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interception of spiraling ballistic missiles","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00532784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032899S","chronDate":"21-23 Jun 1995","isNumber":"11355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3920","citationCount":"16","articleId":"532784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":532864,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We then introduce a model for networks with a variable number of converters and analyze the effect of wavelength converter density on the blocking probability. This framework is applied to three regular network topologies that have varying levels of connectivity: the ring, the mesh-torus, and the hypercube. The results show that either a relatively small number of converters is sufficient for a certain level of performance or that conversion does not offer a significant advantage. The benefits of conversion are largely dependent on the network load, the number of available wavelengths, and the connectivity of the network. Finally, the tradeoff between physical connectivity, wavelength conversion, and the number of available wavelengths is studied through networks with random topologies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-optical networks with sparse wavelength conversion","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.532864","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/11235/00532864.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.532864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"All-optical networks with sparse wavelength conversion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5373871","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-optical networks with sparse wavelength conversion","sourcePdf":"00532864.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055235S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"290","articleId":"532864","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":532871,"authors":[{"name":"I.F.

Movement-based location update is selected for its simplicity. It does not require each mobile terminal to store information about the arrangement and the distance relationship of all cells. In fact, each mobile terminal only keeps a counter of the number of cells visited. A location update is performed when this counter exceeds a predefined threshold value. This scheme allows the dynamic selection of the movement threshold on a per-user basis. This is desirable as different users may have very different mobility patterns. Selective paging reduces the cost for locating a mobile terminal in the expense of an increase in the paging delay. We propose a selective paging scheme which significantly decreases the location tracking cost under a small increase in the allowable paging delay. We introduce an analytical model for the proposed location tracking mechanism which captures the mobility and the incoming call arrival patterns of each mobile terminal. Analytical results are provided to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed scheme under various parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532871/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","volume":"4","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"5373878","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Movement-based location update and selective paging for PCS networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Movement-based location update and selective paging for PCS networks","sourcePdf":"00532871.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041318S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"445","articleId":"532871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":532875,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In the design and analysis of this scheme we utilize the equivalent additive-noise channel model of the ECDQ. For Gaussian sources and a square error distortion measure, the coding performance of the pre/post filtered ECDQ approaches the rate-distortion function, as the dimension of the (optimal) lattice quantizer becomes large; actually, in this case the proposed coding scheme simulates the optimal forward channel realization of the rate-distortion function. For non-Gaussian sources and finite-dimensional lattice quantizers, the coding rate exceeds the rate-distortion function by at most the sum of two terms: the \"information divergence of the source from Gaussianity\" and the \"information divergence of the quantization noise from Gaussianity\". Additional bounds on the excess rate of the scheme from the rate-distortion function are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/18.532876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/11236/00532876.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.532876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11236","startPage":"1340","endPage":"1353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information rates of pre/post-filtered dithered quantizers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Information rates of pre/post-filtered dithered quantizers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532876/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5371654","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information rates of pre/post-filtered dithered quantizers","sourcePdf":"00532876.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053865S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"66","articleId":"532876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":532877,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Since this result holds for general classes of sources, it extends Rissanen's (1986) strong converse theorem for parametric families. While our earlier result has established strong optimality only for mixture codes weighted by the capacity-achieving prior, our first result herein extends this finding to a general prior. For some cases our technique also leads to a simplified proof of the above mentioned strong converse theorem. The major interest in this paper, however, is in extending the theory of universal coding to hierarchical structures of classes, where each class may have a different capacity. In this setting, one wishes to incur redundancy essentially as small as that corresponding to the active class, and not the union of classes. Our main result is that the redundancy of a code based on a two-stage mixture (first, within each class, and then over the classes), is no worse than that of any other code for \"most\" sources of \"most\" classes. If, in addition, the classes can be efficiently distinguished by a certain decision rule, then the best attainable redundancy is given explicitly by the capacity of the active class plus the normalized negative logarithm of the prior probability assigned to this class. These results suggest some interesting guidelines as for the choice of the prior. We also discuss some examples with a natural hierarchical partition into classes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532877/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5371655","volume":"42","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical universal coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical universal coding","sourcePdf":"00532877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0369S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","articleId":"532877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":532878,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

We use the memoryless property of the exponential distribution to develop a new noniterative algorithm for obtaining the optimal quantizer design. We show how to obtain the optimal ECSQ either with or without an additional constraint on the number of levels in the quantizer. In contrast to prior methods, which require a multidimensional iterative solution of a large number of nonlinear equations, the new method needs only a single sequence of solutions to one-dimensional nonlinear equations (in some Laplacian cases, one additional two-dimensional solution is needed). As a result, the new method is orders of magnitude faster than prior ones. We show that as the constraint on the number of levels in the quantizer is relaxed, the optimal ECSQ becomes a uniform threshold quantizer (UTQ) for exponential, but not for Laplacian sources. We then further examine the performance of the UTQ and optimal ECSQ, and also investigate some interesting alternatives to the UTQ, including a uniform-reconstruction quantizer (URQ) and a constant dead-zone ratio quantizer (CDZRQ).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.532878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11236","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1374","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/11236/00532878.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient scalar quantization of exponential and Laplacian random variables","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient scalar quantization of exponential and Laplacian random variables","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5371656","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient scalar quantization of exponential and Laplacian random variables","sourcePdf":"00532878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038446S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"127","articleId":"532878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":532881,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Several new and old lower bounds on the capacity are derived in a unified manner by assuming different front-end receiver filters, in particular the sampled whitened matched filter (SWMF) and the minimum mean-squared error-decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) filter. The features of the bounds are demonstrated and compared in several examples with binary and quaternary input signals. It is also shown that the effect of an ideal post-cursor or tail cancellation, in an information-preserving context, depends primarily on the front-end filter. While, as is well known, ideal post-cursor cancellation at the output of the SWMF decreases the information, the opposite trend is seen when an MMSE-DFE front filter is considered. This observation reflects the basic theoretical obstacles in precoding, i.e., ideal post-cursor cancellation in the presence of a pre-cursor. It is used to assess the inherent loss (in terms of information rates as compared to the rates achievable with the hypothetical ideal post-cursor cancellation) associated with any post-cursor cancellation technique such as precoding, DFE, or other variants, when operating in synergy with the MMSE-DFE front-end filter. The effect of the front-end filter on an ideally interleaved, precoded coded-modulation system is also addressed.","doi":"10.1109/18.532881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/11236/00532881.pdf","startPage":"1388","endPage":"1404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.532881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The intersymbol interference channel: lower bounds on capacity and channel precoding loss","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"The intersymbol interference channel: lower bounds on capacity and channel precoding loss","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532881/","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5371659","volume":"42","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The intersymbol interference channel: lower bounds on capacity and channel precoding loss","sourcePdf":"00532881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109975S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"85","articleId":"532881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":532882,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.S.

The search for near-optimal sequences is shown to have strong connections to the search for sequences with large products of Golay (1977) merit factor times the minimum of the energy density spectrum. Based on Legendre sequences and on Kronecker product sequences, long near-optimal binary sequences are found that have associated noise enhancement factors close to 1 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","volume":"42","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5371686","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the search for good aperiodic binary invertible sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the search for good aperiodic binary invertible sequences","sourcePdf":"00532908.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055527S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"39","articleId":"532908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":532909,"authors":[{"name":"M. van der Vlugt","affiliation":["Mathematical Institute, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands"],"firstName":"M.","lastName":"van der Vlugt","id":"37354147100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"532909","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532909","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chromium","Error correction codes","Hamming weight","Galois fields","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","dual codes","binary sequences","BCH codes","cyclic codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonBCH triple error correcting codes","weight distribution","dual codes","triple error correcting BCH codes","binary primitive BCH codes","binary cyclic codes"]}],"abstract":"We determine the weight distribution of the dual codes of a class of non-BCH triple-error-correcting codes.

In the heavy shadowed MSAT channel which is statistically close to the Rayleigh fading channel, a coded modulation system suffers very severe distortion due to randomly changing phase and the multipath fading. In this scheme, bandwidth efficient block modulation codes are used as the inner codes and Reed-Solomon codes of various error correcting capabilities are used as the outer codes. The inner and outer codes are concatenated in multiple levels. A systematic method for constructing multilevel concatenated modulation codes is presented and a multistage closest coset decoding for these codes is proposed. Specific multilevel concatenated 8-PSK modulation codes have been constructed. These codes are designed to remove the error floor phenomenon or lower the bit-error rate of the error floor caused by the large Doppler frequency shift due to the motion of vehicles. Simulation results show that these codes perform very well and achieve large coding gains over the uncoded reference modulation systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.1995.532922","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1995 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/4005/11520/00532922.pdf","startPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.1995.532922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel concatenated coded modulation schemes for the shadowed mobile satellite communication channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=532922","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-22 Sep 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532922/","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel concatenated coded modulation schemes for the shadowed mobile satellite communication channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5273858","conferenceDate":"17-22 Sept. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel concatenated coded modulation schemes for the shadowed mobile satellite communication channel","confLoc":"Whistler, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00532922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033576S","chronDate":"17-22 Sep 1995","isNumber":"11520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4005","articleId":"532922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":532923,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The different position of the isolating collector gap in the stray magnetic field causes the electron motion in the retarding region to be in one case adiabatic and in the other case nonadiabatic. The kind of motion within the retarding field influences strongly the behavior of the gyrotron with a depressed collector. In the case of nonadiabatic motion a significant amount of transverse momentum is given to the electrons reflected at the collector potential. This causes the reflected electrons to be trapped between the magnetic mirror and the collector. The electrons escape from the trap by diffusion across the magnetic field to the body of the tube thus contributing to the body current. Despite the high body current there is no observable influence of the collector voltage on the RF output power. In the case of adiabatic motion the reflected electrons do not gain a sufficient amount of transverse momentum to be trapped by the magnetic mirror. They pass the cavity toward the gun and they are trapped between the negative gun potential and the collector. The interaction with the RF field by electrons traveling through the cavity enhances the diffusion in the velocity space thus enabling the trapped electrons to overcome the potential barrier and escape toward the collector. Therefore the body current stays at low values since in this case the reflected electrons do not contribute to it. However, at higher collector voltages a reduction of RF power occurred and some noise in the electron beam was observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5382749","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Single-stage depressed collectors for gyrotrons","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-stage depressed collectors for gyrotrons","sourcePdf":"00532940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044519S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"11234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"49","articleId":"532940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":532948,"authors":[{"name":"V.L.

To zeroth order, the required number of amplifiers depends inversely on the parameter A=P/sub p/T/sub p///spl lambda//sup 2/, where /spl lambda/ is the wavelength, and P/sub p/ and T/sub p/ are, respectively, the power and duration of the amplifier output pulses. Thus, one goal of amplifier research is to maximize A while keeping other parameter values within bounds so as not to excessively increase the cost of either the individual amplifier system or the collider structure (e.g., amplifier voltage V/spl lsim/500 kV, wavelength /spl lambda//spl gsim/1 cm). Operating within these bounds, gyro-amplifiers have demonstrated values of A=11/spl times/10/sup 4/ W s/m/sup 2/, which compares favorably with the best values of A achieved by klystrons. The gyro-amplifier program which led to this accomplishment is reviewed. Some 20 different gyro-amplifier configurations have been examined on our 450 kV gyro-amplifier test facility during the past several years. These tubes fall into five major categories: first-, second-, and third-harmonic gyroklystrons, as well as first- and second-harmonic gyrotwystrons. Peak powers in excess of 30 MW with pulse duration of 0.8 /spl mu/s have been achieved at 19.76 GHz in the TE/sub 02/ mode via a two-cavity second-harmonic gyroklystron with a first-harmonic drive cavity. The peak efficiency and gain were 28% and 27 dB, respectively. At present, there is ongoing construction of a new three-cavity second-harmonic coaxial gyroklystron, driven by a 500-kV 720-A beam, which is predicted to have an output power well above 100 MW at 17.136 GHz with an intrinsic efficiency in excess of 40%. With the use of a depressed collector, achievable overall amplifier efficiency, which is of very great importance in the collider application, could be in the range of 50-65%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/532948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1996","accessionNumber":"5382757","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Gyro-amplifiers as candidate RF drivers for TeV linear colliders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gyro-amplifiers as candidate RF drivers for TeV linear colliders","sourcePdf":"00532948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089173S","chronDate":"Jun 1996","isNumber":"11234","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"85","articleId":"532948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":532951,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Increased arterial blood pressure is an early and common occurrence in diabetic nephropathy. Antihypertensive treatment reduces albuminuria and diminishes the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate thereby postponing end stage renal failure in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Enalapril is considered for use as a renal protective drug in normotensive diabetics with persistent microalbuminuria. In a short term experimental study, Enalapril has been shown to reduce the albumin exertion rate in adolescent diabetic patients with or without elevated blood pressure and its antiproteinuric effect independent of its effect on systemic blood pressure. Since these tests are quite expensive and time taking, we have formulated this problem in the framework of an artificial neural network (ANN) to measure the long term efficacy of Enalapril. Based upon the data available from testing of patients, the proposed ANN has been trained using a backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The network is used for the long term efficacy of Enalapril phantomly. The proposed network gives encouraging results.","doi":"10.1109/RCEMBS.1995.533013","pdfPath":"/iel3/3804/11132/00533013.pdf","startPage":"4/27","endPage":"4/28","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First Regional Conference, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society and 14th Conference of the Biomedical Engineering Society of India.

Experimental operation involving both a second-harmonic interaction with the TE/sub 21/ mode and a third-harmonic interaction with the TE/sub 31/ mode, both at 17 GHz, has been characterized.

The best measured phase stability of the TE/sub 31/ amplified pulse was /spl plusmn/10/spl deg/ over a 9-ns period. The phase stability was limited because the maximum RF power was attained when operating far from wiggler resonance. The second harmonic, TE/sub 21/ had a peak amplified power of 2 MW corresponding to 40 dB single-pass gain and 4% efficiency. The second-harmonic interaction showed stronger superradiant emission than the third-harmonic interaction.

This is done through some analysis which describes the use of simple and hold devices for frequency conversion within a radio. Through the use of a perfect multiplier a model is developed in order that the noise figure of a sample and hold device can be predicted. The results show that sample and hold devices have higher noise figures than mixers and hence their use can give rise to reduced receiver sensitivity. The analysis also demonstrates that their noise figure performance is considerably improved through the use of RF gain and filtering. This demonstrates that the ability to sample at RF can only realistically be achieved with appropriate consideration of the necessary RF gain and selectivity, and thus flexible receivers need programmable filters. Interestingly the paper also concludes that an ideal sampler has an infinite noise figure and is therefore useless.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19951116","publicationTitle":"1995 Sixth International Conference on Radio Receivers and Associated Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 Sixth International Conference on Radio Receivers and Associated Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3527/10611/00533430.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"56","doi":"10.1049/cp:19951116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of radio architectures employing sample and hold techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Sep 1995","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of radio architectures employing sample and hold techniques","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-27 Sept. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5119067","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533430/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity analysis of radio architectures employing sample and hold techniques","confLoc":"Bath, UK","sourcePdf":"00533430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028384S","chronDate":"26-27 Sep 1995","isNumber":"10611","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3527","citationCount":"4","articleId":"533430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":533431,"authors":[{"name":"L.P.

This \"guard interval\" consists of a redundant prefix cyclically appended to each bloc of modulated symbols so as to exploit the cyclic convolution property of the DFT. Therefore, besides decreasing the useful transmitted symbol rate, this technique is very specific to DFT-based OFDM systems. In order to implement a digital modulator, an oversampled version of the continuous signal that would be produced by the all-analog ideal modulator is often computed. This amounts to appending null symbols to the block of symbols to be modulated. This work shows that forcing the presence of these null symbols at the appropriate places on the receiver side is sufficient to equalize the channel. Here, a linear equalizer is adapted by minimizing a quadratic criterion based on the energy of the subband signals that should be zero. Since no knowledge upon the \"useful data\" is required, this method performs blind equalization. Moreover, it requires neither a guard interval nor any reference symbol. As a result, for a given channel bit-rate budget, the data rate is increased.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind equalization of OFDM systems based on the minimization of a quadratic criterion","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1996.533623","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3816/11160/00533623.pdf","startPage":"1318","endPage":"1322 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1996.533623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=533623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Blind equalization of OFDM systems based on the minimization of a quadratic criterion","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5443373","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind equalization of OFDM systems based on the minimization of a quadratic criterion","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00533623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034802S","chronDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3816","citationCount":"62","articleId":"533623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":533625,"authors":[{"name":"J.-F.

The utilisation of optical orthogonal codes (OOC) as signature sequences is investigated.

It is demonstrated that there exists an optimum PPM order, at a given number of users. Original results are presented that evaluate the dispersion in the optical diffuse infrared channel and its effects on optical orthogonal codes (OOC). A new equalisation technique is introduced and analysed in the context of this channel. The method is shown to be effective in reducing the resultant intersymbol interference (ISI).

The results indicate that good performance can be achieved with minimum hardware overheads.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1996.533653","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3816/11160/00533653.pdf","startPage":"1467","endPage":"1471 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1996.533653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of indoor infrared wireless networks utilising PPM CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=533653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533653/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of indoor infrared wireless networks utilising PPM CDMA","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5443401","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of indoor infrared wireless networks utilising PPM CDMA","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00533653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054022S","chronDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3816","citationCount":"4","articleId":"533653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":533654,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

We show that for certain classes of filters with moderately wide passbands, it is possible to increase the stopband suppression by up to 20 dB without increasing the number of multipliers, simply by increasing the number of delay elements, zeroing the appropriate taps, and optimizing the other taps using linear programming. Another use for sparse FIR filters is for the case where multipliers have failed. Graceful degradation can be achieved in some types of FIR filters by optimally adjusting the functional elements to compensate for the failed multipliers. This approach can also be used to minimize the peak sidelobe level for beamformers that may have failed elements.

We have developed a new, relatively simple approach to designing sparse cascaded filters, also described in the literature as interpolated FIR filters. Our method is heuristic in nature, but gives surprisingly good results without requiring iterative design or investigation of a large number of alternative parameterizations. The design uses the efficient and widely available Remez exchange algorithm along with some routines that we have written for Matlab. Although the resulting designs are not optimal in a minimax-error sense, they have reduced RMS error, which may be attractive for some applications. We give design examples, and study the effects of coefficient quantization.","doi":"10.1109/78.533713","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1923","endPage":"1931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11170/00533713.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.533713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to designing computationally efficient interpolated FIR filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Band pass filters","Passband","IIR filters","Delay","Quantization","Narrowband","Information filtering","Information filters","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","FIR filters","digital filters","filtering theory","cascade networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computationally efficient interpolated FIR filters","FIR filter design","sparse filter structure","sparse cascaded filters","heuristic method","Remez exchange algorithm","Matlab","RMS error reduction","coefficient quantization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A new approach to designing computationally efficient interpolated FIR filters","volume":"44","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5356436","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533713/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to designing computationally efficient interpolated FIR filters","sourcePdf":"00533713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043105S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11170","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","articleId":"533713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":533715,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.T.

An orthonormal basis may not, however, always be a suitable representation of a signal, particularly when time (or space) invariance is a required property. The conventional way around this problem is to use a redundant decomposition. We address the time-invariance problem for orthonormal wavelet transforms and propose an extension to wavelet packet decompositions. We show that it,is possible to achieve time invariance and preserve the orthonormality. We subsequently propose an efficient approach to obtain such a decomposition.

In order to place an estimator on this plane for comparison with the delta-sigma tradeoff curve, the estimator variance, bias gradient, and bias gradient norm must be evaluated.

It is equivalent to identifying the frequency response of the system by calculating the empirical cross-spectrum between the system's input and output, divided by the empirical auto-spectrum of the input process. However, if the additive noise at the system's output is correlated with the input process, e.g., in case of environmental noise that affects both system's input and output, the method may suffer from a severe bias effect. We present a modification of the cross-spectral method that exploits nonstationary features in the data in order to circumvent bias effects caused by correlated stationary noise.

Although advanced coding and modulation techniques as well as different cell cluster architectures have been implemented, a great increase in the channel capacity is needed, especially in large markets. Adaptive sensor processing has been introduced as a possible remedy to increase the channel capacity by using the directional sensitivity, which leads to a reduction of the interference. Some high-resolution algorithms are evaluated for the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for a cellular mobile radio environment whose cluster size is varied from K=7, K=4, and K=3; more signals and scattering scenarios that typically arise in urban areas are taken into account. This information is used to beamform toward the signal of interest, resulting in a decrease of the interference. Several signal estimation procedures are evaluated and compared, and it is observed that the DOAs, among other benefits, leads to even higher performance compared with the reference signal method. The computational aspects for the different signal processing, detection and estimation schemes are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533756/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","volume":"45","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5354870","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive array sensor processing applications for mobile telephone communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive array sensor processing applications for mobile telephone communications","sourcePdf":"00533756.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058344S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"34","articleId":"533756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":533757,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Practical systems that are envisioned must support different types of calls. These may include voice only, mixed voice and data, high-speed data, low-speed data, image transmission, and an array of intelligent network services. In addition there may be a mixture of platforms (such as persons, autos, buses, trains, boats, and planes) having a range of mobility characteristics. In such environments, the bandwidth and/or resources needed for different call sessions will not be identical. As a result, calls will generally encounter different blocking and hand-off constraints. These effects are in addition to differences in blocking and forced (call) termination probabilities that are attributable to differing platform mobilities and (resource) channel quotas. Cellular systems with mixed platforms that support calls with differing resource requirements are considered. Loss-type systems and hybrid delay-loss systems are treated. In each case, priority access to resources for hand-off calls is allowable. We identify a suitable state characterization and framework for a performance analysis that enables numerical computation of theoretical performance results. Example performance characteristics are obtained. These show carried traffic, blocking probability, and forced termination probability for each platform type and for each call type.","doi":"10.1109/25.533760","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/11171/00533760.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"458","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.533760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prioritized resource assignment for mobile cellular communication systems with mixed services and platform types","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Prioritized resource assignment for mobile cellular communication systems with mixed services and platform types","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5354874","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prioritized resource assignment for mobile cellular communication systems with mixed services and platform types","sourcePdf":"00533760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041714S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"59","articleId":"533760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":533761,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Wang","id":"37086990270"},{"name":"C.K.

The rate of phase change is such that phase change over two symbol intervals is negligible, but it is not necessarily negligible over a longer interval.

In addition to numerical results, we present results pertaining to capacity improvements achieved over the CLCR, derived from a simulation of a multiuser direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) mobile radio system.","doi":"10.1109/25.533766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/11171/00533766.pdf","startPage":"503","endPage":"521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.533766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sliding window decorrelating receiver for multiuser DS-CDMA mobile radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"A sliding window decorrelating receiver for multiuser DS-CDMA mobile radio networks","volume":"45","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5354880","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533766/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sliding window decorrelating receiver for multiuser DS-CDMA mobile radio networks","sourcePdf":"00533766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072824S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","articleId":"533766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":533767,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Ju Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Ju Chang","id":"37276906400"},{"name":"Jeh-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeh-Ho Lee","id":"37350939600"},{"name":"Fang-Ching Ren","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering and Center for Telecommunications Research, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fang-Ching Ren","id":"37339718300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"533767","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Phase change materials","Multiaccess communication","Delta modulation","Land mobile radio","Stability","Time division multiple access","Radio control","Frequency division multiaccess","Radio link"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","telecommunication control","power control","radio links","probability","pulse code modulation","telecommunication network reliability","channel capacity","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA cellular mobile radio system","uplink","SIR based power control","direct sequence-code division multiple access","link performance","system capacity","delta modulation","pulse code modulation","strength based power control","outage probability","simulation results","optimal design parameters","stepsize","control mode","PCM PC mechanisms","stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=533767","abstract":"Power control (PC) is an important issue in a direct sequence-code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) cellular mobile radio system. Higher link performance and greater system capacity cannot be achieved unless an appropriate PC mechanism is employed. In previous research, a delta-modulation (DM) realization of strength-based and SIR-based PC mechanisms for uplink communication has been studied by simulation. In order to obtain higher PC trackability, we study a pulse-code-modulation (PCM) realization of the above two PC mechanisms for the uplink of a DS-CDMA cellular mobile radio system. The simulation results presented indicate that the PC mechanisms with PCM realization for the uplink can achieve a lower outage probability and thus higher link performance than the PC mechanisms with DM realization. We also obtain optimal design parameters such as the stepsize and the control mode for the two PCM PC mechanisms. In addition, we compare the two PCM PC mechanisms in terms of their outage probability and stability and find that the strength-based mechanism has a higher outage probability but greater stability than the SIR-based mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/25.533767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/11171/00533767.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.533767","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of power control mechanisms with PCM realization for the uplink of a DS-CDMA cellular mobile radio system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Design of power control mechanisms with PCM realization for the uplink of a DS-CDMA cellular mobile radio system","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5354881","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of power control mechanisms with PCM realization for the uplink of a DS-CDMA cellular mobile radio system","sourcePdf":"00533767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046896S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"44","articleId":"533767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":533768,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The increasing demand for capacity motivates the study of alternate systems and enhancements to the adopted TDMA standards. In particular, CDMA techniques using direct sequence and slow frequency hopping have been suggested. We analyze the capacity of a slow-frequency-hopped TDMA-based cellular system via calculation of the outage probability. Expressions for the outage probability as a function of voice activity, power control, and antenna diversity are provided for mobile-to-base transmission. These expressions are used to evaluate the system capacity (users/MHz/cell) based on simulating mobile locations within 37 hexagonal cells. The sensitivity to power control error, voice activity factor, and soft capacity of the system is investigated.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/11171/00533768.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.533768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.533768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11171","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=533768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity analysis of a TDMA-based slow-frequency-hopped cellular system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","North America","Europe","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Frequency","Capacity planning","Probability","Mobile antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time division multiple access","frequency hop communication","channel capacity","cellular radio","digital radio","telecommunication standards","probability","telecommunication control","diversity reception","land mobile radio","power control","channel coding","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","slow-frequency-hopped cellular system","time-division multiple access","first generation digital cellular standards","North America","Europe","Japan","TDMA standards","CDMA","direct sequence","system capacity","outage probability","block coding","power control","antenna diversity","mobile to base transmission","power control error","voice activity factor","soft capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Capacity analysis of a TDMA-based slow-frequency-hopped cellular system","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5354882","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity analysis of a TDMA-based slow-frequency-hopped cellular system","sourcePdf":"00533768.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038802S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"34","articleId":"533768","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":533769,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this respect, the satellite downlink is also different from its terrestrial counterpart. A two-state fading channel model is considered. In the nonshadowed state, the signal envelope is characterized by Rician statistics and in the shadowed state by the Rayleigh statistics.

This technique applies the modified shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) method to find equivalent sources (images) in each launched ray tube and sums the receiving complex amplitude contributed by all images coherently. In addition, the vector effective antenna height (VEH) is introduced to consider the polarization-coupling effect resulting from the shape of the tunnels. We verify this approach by comparing the numerical results in two canonical examples where closed-form solutions exist. The good agreement indicates that our method can provide a good approximation of high-frequency radio propagation inside tunnels where reflection is dominant. We show that the propagation loss in tunnels can vary considerably according to the tunnel shapes and the traffic inside them. From the results we also find a \"focusing\" effect, which makes the power received in an arched tunnel higher than that in a rectangular tunnel. Besides, the deep fading that appears in a rectangular tunnel is absent in an arched tunnel. The major effect of the traffic is observed to be the fast fading due to the reflection/obstruction of vehicles. Additional considerations, such as time delay, wall roughness, and wedge diffraction of radio wave propagation in tunnels are left for future studies.","doi":"10.1109/25.533772","startPage":"570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/11171/00533772.pdf","endPage":"578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.533772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533772/","displayDocTitle":"SBR image approach for radio wave propagation in tunnels with and without traffic","volume":"45","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5354886","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SBR image approach for radio wave propagation in tunnels with and without traffic","sourcePdf":"00533772.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033843S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11171","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"102","articleId":"533772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":533773,"authors":[{"name":"Seong-Cheol Kim","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Seong-Cheol Kim","id":"37350233400"},{"name":"H.L.

Power supply noises can have a tremendous effect on system operation and performance. The circuit simulation of a system power distribution is very challenging since it requires accurate models of active devices, passive components, transmission lines, and a very large power distribution network. This paper presents the development of a high-frequency power distribution model for the simulation of simultaneous switching noise of a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) chip on a multilayered ceramic substrate. Measurements are performed on a CMOS chip with simultaneously switching off-chip drivers (OCD's).

A laser diode (LD) is passively positioned by utilizing a pair of alignment marks, each of which located on the LD and Si substrate, a single-mode fiber with a microhemispherical lens on the fiber facet is self-aligned on a Si-V groove.

One critical thermal path to be managed is from a VCSEL to a case (heat sink), which is affected by packaging technologies and materials The measured VCSEL-to-case resistance of a laser with 8-/spl mu/m aperture was 1650/spl deg/C/W, and that of a 20-/spl mu/m device was 1070/spl deg/C/W. These thermal resistances are much larger than those for the edge-emitting lasers; advanced device and packaging technologies are being developed to reduce these resistances. To study the packaging effects, a three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model has been developed and calibrated by the measured data. The calibrated model was used to understand the difference in thermal behavior: 1) between a wire-bonded and a flip-chip VCSEL module, 2) between a single-VCSEL and an 8/spl times/8 VCSEL module, and 3) between a bottom-cooled and a top-cooled module.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533893/","volume":"19","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5359161","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thermal management of VCSEL-based optoelectronic modules","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal management of VCSEL-based optoelectronic modules","sourcePdf":"00533893.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035773S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"10","articleId":"533893","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":533903,"authors":[{"name":"V.N.

Conduction failure mechanisms have been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The analysis shows that failure is dependent on competition between driving factors; thermal stress, elastic stress, expansion due to moisture absorption on one side, and the resistant factor, i.e., interatomic force.

In order to predict the growth of this IMC layer during the operating life of the solder joint and its effect on the thermal fatigue life, the formation characteristics of the IMC's in 0805 and 1206 LCCC solder joints are systematically studied in this investigation. Only the stable Cu/sub 6/Sn/sub 5/% /spl eta/-phase intermetallic compound was observed in all as-solidified solder joints as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). The mean layer thickness was found to increase almost linearly with reflow time up to about 200 s. The thickness of the interfacial IMC layer increased with increasing reflow temperature for 0805-type solder joints up to around 250/spl deg/C and reached a saturated thickness of 2.5 /spl mu/m beyond this temperature. Additional intermetallic formation due to higher reflow temperature or longer reflow time would appear as Cu-Sn whiskers in the bulk solder of the joint. The copper land pad size and quality of component lead metallization were also found to greatly affect the formation of Cu-Sn IMC in surface mount solder joints, and hence its reliability in terms of thermal fatigue life and mechanical properties.","doi":"10.1109/96.533909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part B","pdfPath":"/iel4/96/11172/00533909.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/96.533909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability studies of surface mount solder joints - effect of Cu-Sn intermetallic compounds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Reliability studies of surface mount solder joints - effect of Cu-Sn intermetallic compounds","volume":"19","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5359177","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability studies of surface mount solder joints - effect of Cu-Sn intermetallic compounds","sourcePdf":"00533909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026486S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"96","citationCount":"68","articleId":"533909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":533925,"authors":[{"name":"R.O.

The WAAS will aid GPS with the following three services. First, it will broadcast spread-spectrum ranging signals from communication satellites. The airborne WAAS receiver will add these new ranging signals to the GPS constellation of measurements. By so doing, the augmented position fix will be less sensitive to the failure of individual system components, thus improving time availability and continuity of service. Second, the WAAS will use a nationwide ground network to monitor the health of all satellites over our airspace and flag situations which threaten flight safety. This data will be modulated on to the WAAS ranging signals and broadcast to the users, thereby guaranteeing the integrity of the airborne position fix. Third, the WAAS will use the ground network to develop corrections for the errors which currently limit the accuracy of unaugmented GPS. This data will also be included on the WAAS broadcast and will improve position accuracy from approximately 100 m to 8 m. When complete, the augmented system will provide an accurate position fix from satellites to an unlimited number of aircraft across the nation. It will be the primary navigation system for aircraft in oceanic routes, enroute over our domestic airspace, in crowded metropolitan airspaces, and on airport approach.","doi":"10.1109/5.533954","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/11069/00533954.pdf","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.533954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide area augmentation of the Global Positioning System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=533954","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533954/","displayDocTitle":"Wide area augmentation of the Global Positioning System","volume":"84","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5350820","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide area augmentation of the Global Positioning System","sourcePdf":"00533954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048001S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"115","articleId":"533954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":533956,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Consequently, testing is an indispensable part of system design and implementation; yet it has proved to be a formidable task for complex systems. This motivates the study of testing finite stare machines to ensure the correct functioning of systems and to discover aspects of their behavior. A finite state machine contains a finite number of states and produces outputs on state transitions after receiving inputs. Finite state machines are widely used to model systems in diverse areas, including sequential circuits, certain types of programs, and, more recently, communication protocols. In a testing problem we have a machine about which we lack some information; we would like to deduce this information by providing a sequence of inputs to the machine and observing the outputs produced. Because of its practical importance and theoretical interest, the problem of testing finite state machines has been studied in different areas and at various times. The earliest published literature on this topic dates back to the 1950's. Activities in the 1960's mid early 1970's were motivated mainly by automata theory and sequential circuit testing. The area seemed to have mostly died down until a few years ago when the testing problem was resurrected and is now being studied anew due to its applications to conformance testing of communication protocols. While some old problems which had been open for decades were resolved recently, new concepts and more intriguing problems from new applications emerge. We review the fundamental problems in testing finite state machines and techniques for solving these problems, tracing progress in the area from its inception to the present and the stare of the art. In addition, we discuss extensions of finite state machines and some other topics related to testing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533956/","volume":"84","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"5350821","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Principles and methods of testing finite state machines-a survey","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principles and methods of testing finite state machines-a survey","sourcePdf":"00533956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100589S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"721","articleId":"533956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":533958,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The taxonomy is based on two criteria: the number of execution modes supported by the system and the number of machine models present in the system. Since these two criteria are orthogonal, four classes exist: Single Execution mode/Single machine Model (SESM), Single Execution modes/Multiple machine Models (SEMM), Multiple Execution modes/Single machine Model (MESM), and Multiple Execution modes/Multiple machine Models (MEMM). In Section II, heterogeneous computing concepts are viewed through three phases of the compilation and execution of any heterogeneous application: parallelism detection, parallelism characterization and resource allocation. Parallelism detection phase discovers fine-grain parallelism inside every task. This phase is not an exclusive feature of heterogeneous computing, so it will not be dealt with in greater detail. The assignment of parallelism characterization phase is to estimate the behavior of each task in the application on every architecture in the heterogeneous system. In the parallelism characterization domain, one original taxonomy is given. This taxonomy contains scheme classes such as vector and matrix static and dynamic, implicit and explicit, algorithmic and heuristic and numeric and symbolic. Resource allocation phase determines the place and the moment for execution of every task to optimize certain performance measure related to some criteria. In the resource allocation domain, the existing Casavant-Kuhl taxonomy is extended and used. This well known taxonomy is supplemented with scheme classes such as noncooperative competitive, noncooperative noncompetitive, and load sharing. In Section III, heterogeneous systems characterized with multiple execution modes (\"fully\" heterogeneous systems falling in the MESM and the MEMM class) are surveyed. The MESM class systems are described and illustrated with three case studies, two of which support SIMD/MIMD and one supports scalar/vector combination of execution modes. The MEMM class systems are described and illustrated with two representative examples of fully heterogeneous networks supporting multiple execution modes. The system software for heterogeneous computing systems is presented according to an original three-dimensional (3-D) taxonomy whose criteria rely on the level of heterogeneity support implementation, the programming approach, and the data access technique applied. In Section III, several representative heterogeneous applications are described with their computation requirements and the systems used for their execution. Each topic covered in the paper contains several concise examples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.533958","doi":"10.1109/5.533958","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/11069/00533958.pdf","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1144","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of heterogeneous computing: concepts and systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A survey of heterogeneous computing: concepts and systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/533958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"84","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5350822","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of heterogeneous computing: concepts and systems","sourcePdf":"00533958.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060392S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"24","articleId":"533958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":533960,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

This paper is concerned with underwater, ground and aerial vehicles operating in a fully autonomous (nonteleoperated) mode.

The distinction is one in which the AV is likely to be designed for autonomous operation rather than being adapted for it as would be the case for manned vehicles. We provide a survey of the technological progress that has been made in AV's, the current research issues and approaches that are continuing that progress, and the applications which motivate this work. It should be noted that issues of control are pervasive regardless of the kind of AV being considered, but that there are special considerations in the design and operation of AV's depending on whether the focus is on vehicles underwater on the ground, or in the air.

The main features are that the defining equations of motion for the process to be controlled are poorly known with respect to their functional forms, and that the functional forms, themselves, may undergo sudden and unexpected variation. It is well known that such systems are difficult to control, particularly when the effect of the control action enters nonlinearly.

Reliability becomes a concern when packages are exposed to a humid environment for a prolonged time and then processed through a reflow oven. Thermo-mechanical and moisture induced interfacial stresses generated between the die attach and die may lead to die delamination and package cracking. Current package level moisture evaluation methods are based on experimental weight gain measurements and visual inspection after reflow for cracking or delamination. This study presents a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation of the moisture weight gain or loss in plastic ball grid array (PBGA) packages as a function of time including the effects of package geometry and material selection. Experimental weight gain and bakeout data for a 68 I/O PBGA package are shown to closely match FEA model predictions. Diffusivity and solubility property data for common packaging materials are given as a function of temperature ranging from 23/spl deg/C to 150/spl deg/C. Solder pot dip tests performed at 230/spl deg/C indicate that popcorn failures result when the moisture concentration in the die attach region exceeds 0.0048 g/cm/sup 3/ for the specific package tested.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 May-1 Jun 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 May-1 June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5436521","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Moisture absorption and desorption predictions for plastic ball grid array packages","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moisture absorption and desorption predictions for plastic ball grid array packages","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00534560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033155S","chronDate":"29 May-1 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3801","citationCount":"12","articleId":"534560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":534584,"authors":[{"name":"N.V.

We present two different architectures for decoding systematic DI codes: (a) an enumeration-based decoder, and (b) a comparison-based decoder. We argue that enumeration-based decoders are often impractical for many realistic codes. Comparison-based decoders that detect arrival of a code word by comparing the received check bit with check bits evaluated using the received data are practical but suffer from the following limitation. If the decoder is to be implemented using asynchronous logic, i.e., if the gate and wire delays are arbitrary (unbounded but finite), then it is impossible to design a comparison-based decoder for any code that is more efficient than a dual-rail code. In other words, the encoded word must contain at least twice as many bits as the data. The paper shows that comparison-based decoders for codes that have the requisite level of redundancy can be implemented using asynchronous logic. The paper also shows that, by relaxing the delay assumptions, it is possible to implement decoders for delay-insensitive codes that are more efficient than dual-rail codes.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Annual Symposium on Fault Tolerant Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Annual Symposium on Fault Tolerant Computing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3791/11109/00534608.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations of VLSI implementation of delay-insensitive codes","doi":"10.1109/FTCS.1996.534608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTCS.1996.534608","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=534608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Limitations of VLSI implementation of delay-insensitive codes","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5352039","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 June 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations of VLSI implementation of delay-insensitive codes","confLoc":"Sendai, Japan","sourcePdf":"00534608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039958S","chronDate":"25-27 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3791","citationCount":"11","articleId":"534608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":534616,"authors":[{"name":"T.K.

As circuit technology became more powerful and practical, work on ECC progressed to implement more sophisticated codes. The result is a variety of robust ECC algorithms and implementations. Every commercially available data storage device incorporates ECC designed specifically for its particular media, transport, electronics and operating characteristics. As a result, today's data storage devices tolerate a broad range of harsh conditions. In this paper, we will discuss the various codes which have been employed in data storage devices; including tape, disks and solid-state recorders. We will then describe DATATAPE's new approach to implementing Reed-Solomon (RS) algorithms into programmable devices to achieve flexibility in ECC capability. The algorithms involved will be a function of media and operational characteristics.

The objectives of this paper are: to study the stability properties of DNNC; and to study the on-line adaptation properties of DNNC. In this study four basic assumptions are made. The process is modeled with continuous time functions. If the process is nonstationary, it is also necessary to assure that changes will be continuous and smooth over small intervals of time, i.e. that process parameters change in a continuous manner. The time between model adaptation is small relative to time scale of parameter changes. Process parameters will not change at once, but only a small subset of them.","doi":"10.1109/NAFIPS.1996.534717","pdfPath":"/iel3/3792/11110/00534717.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"133","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of North American Fuzzy Information Processing","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of North American Fuzzy Information Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAFIPS.1996.534717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic neural network control of nonlinear-time varying systems: stability analysis, optimal network structure, and on-line adaptation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534717/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic neural network control of nonlinear-time varying systems: stability analysis, optimal network structure, and on-line adaptation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5352147","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic neural network control of nonlinear-time varying systems: stability analysis, optimal network structure, and on-line adaptation","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00534717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036925S","chronDate":"19-22 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3792","articleId":"534717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":534722,"authors":[{"name":"Dipti Srinivasan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Dipti Srinivasan","id":"37087167600"},{"name":"C.S.

This paper examines the improvement that results from using the MAP auto-calibrated steering vectors in standard DF-based beamformers to estimate the received signal waveforms and suppress unwanted interference.

Difficulties of its application in wireless communications, however, are due largely to the characteristics of the propagation media-multipath delays and fast fading. The challenge is achieving blind equalisation using only a limited amount of data. We present a multiple objective optimization approach to fast blind channel equalization. By investigating first the performance (mean-square error) of the standard fractionally spaced constant modulus algorithm (CMA) equalizer in the presence of noise, we show that the CMA local minima exist near the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalizers. Consequently, the CMA may converge to a local minimum corresponding to a poorly designed MMSE receiver with a considerably large mean-square error. Based on the multiple objective optimization techniques, we propose next a blind channel estimator by exploiting simultaneously the second-order cyclostationary statistics and the constant modulus of QAM-type communication signals.

The channels can be represented as FIR filters which have to be identified and/or equalized for the transmitted symbols to be recovered. The problem of identifying/equalizing a digital communication channel based on its temporally or spatially oversampled output has gained much attention (single-input/multiple-output-SIMO-deconvolution). In this context, we propose a new joint data/channel estimation method. Our technique relies on the minimization of a bilinear MSE cost function, where the variables to be adjusted are the channel coefficient matrix and a linear equalizer. We show that this a priori choice of a linear equalization structure allows the derivation of a second-order unimodal criterion, leading to globally convergent identification/equalization schemes. The proposed method is completely blind in that (1) no assumption is required upon the transmitted sequence statistics or alphabet, and (2) it shows some robustness with respect to the channel order estimation problem (thus improving on most previous related works). It also allows the free choice of a delay in the equalizer so that output noise amplification can be optimized.","doi":"10.1109/SSAP.1996.534845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11127","startPage":"168","endPage":"171","pdfPath":"/iel3/3799/11127/00534845.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSAP.1996.534845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust blind joint data/channel estimation based on bilinear optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Context","Digital communication","Intersymbol interference","Equalizers","Finite impulse response filter","Cost function","Statistics","Noise robustness","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bilinear systems","digital radio","adaptive equalisers","parameter estimation","optimisation","signal sampling","deconvolution","convergence of numerical methods","delays","FIR filters","filtering theory","telecommunication channels","matrix algebra","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust blind joint data/channel estimation","bilinear optimization","digital communication channel identification","digital communication channel equalisation","spatially oversampled output","temporally oversampled output","single-input/multiple-output deconvolution","SIMO deconvolution","bilinear MSE cost function minimisation","channel coefficient matrix","linear equalizer","second-order unimodal criterion","globally convergent identification/equalization","channel order estimation","delay","output noise amplification","digital radio communications","propagation channels","intersymbol interference","ISI","FIR filters","transmitted symbols recovery","adaptive equaliser"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Robust blind joint data/channel estimation based on bilinear optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534845/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5424608","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust blind joint data/channel estimation based on bilinear optimization","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"00534845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04517S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3799","citationCount":"20","articleId":"534845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":534867,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In contrast to the standard FIR modelling we assume that the overall channel has an arbitrary finite order rational transfer function. Certain quite reasonable technical hypotheses allow one to adapt the existing linear prediction and subspace based approach and to implement a finite order zero-forcing equalizer (ZFE) in the noise-free case. The noise-free condition also yields a simple performance analysis which is quite accurate at low noise levels and provides a meaningful comparison of the proposed estimators. The robustness to additive noise is studied by computer simulations for both techniques. We focus on the deconvolution performance, i.e the residual ISI at the output of ZFE.","doi":"10.1109/SSAP.1996.534888","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3799/11127/00534888.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSAP.1996.534888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11127","startPage":"348","endPage":"351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple input, multiple output ARMA systems: second order blind identification for signal extraction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=534888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple input, multiple output ARMA systems: second order blind identification for signal extraction","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534888/","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5424651","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple input, multiple output ARMA systems: second order blind identification for signal extraction","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"00534888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03623S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3799","citationCount":"4","articleId":"534888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":534890,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The prewhitening step makes these algorithms sensitive to the presence of additive Gaussian noise. A higher-order-only technique is presented. The identification problem is approached in a (linear and multilinear) algebraic framework: our derivation starts with the observation that the solution can be obtained from the canonical decomposition (CANDECOMP) of a higher-order cumulant tensor. Next, it is demonstrated that the CANDECOMP components follow from the simultaneous diagonalization, by congruence transformation, of a set of matrices. A reformulation in terms of orthogonal unknowns leads to a simultaneous Schur decomposition, which is solved by a Givens-type iteration. The technique can be considered as the higher-order-only equivalent of the popular JADE-algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/SSAP.1996.534890","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3799/11127/00534890.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSAP.1996.534890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11127","startPage":"356","endPage":"359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independent component analysis based on higher-order statistics only","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=534890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Independent component analysis based on higher-order statistics only","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534890/","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5424653","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent component analysis based on higher-order statistics only","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"00534890.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030181S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3799","citationCount":"20","articleId":"534890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":534894,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Multiple antennas can provide a processing gain to increase the base station range and improve coverage. Also, by exploiting the spatial selectivity of an antenna array, interference may be reduced which in turn can be traded for increased capacity of the system. A wide range of wireless communication systems may benefit from spatial processing including high mobility cellular systems, low mobility short range systems, wireless local loop applications, satellite communications and wireless LAN. By employing an array of antennas, it is possible to multiplex channels in the spatial dimension just as in the frequency and time dimension. This is often referred to as spatial division multiple access (SDMA). To increase system capacity, spatially selective reception as well as spatially selective transmission must be achieved. Herein, we present some different approaches and techniques for spatial/temporal processing. Critical aspects of SDMA for both high mobility cellular systems and low mobility or movable systems are reviewed and the potential benefits examined.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3799/11127/00534916.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"473","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th Workshop on Statistical Signal and Array Processing","doi":"10.1109/SSAP.1996.534916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSAP.1996.534916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=534916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Array processing for wireless communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Wireless communication","Antenna arrays","Base stations","Wireless LAN","Multiaccess communication","Wireless networks","Interference","Satellite communication","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cellular radio","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","space division multiplexing","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communications","base stations","antenna arrays","spatial dimension","multiple antennas","processing gain","range","coverage","spatial selectivity","interference","capacity","spatial division multiple access","spatially selective reception","spatially selective transmission","spatial/temporal processing","high mobility cellular systems","low mobility systems","movable systems","wireless LAN","satellite communications","wireless local loop applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Array processing for wireless communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5430473","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Array processing for wireless communications","confLoc":"Corfu, Greece","sourcePdf":"00534916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060152S","chronDate":"24-26 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3799","citationCount":"41","articleId":"534916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":534921,"authors":[{"name":"A.

For a given bandwidth allocation, pyramid broadcasting schemes substantially reduce the viewer latency (waiting) time as compared with conventional broadcasting schemes. Nevertheless, such pyramid schemes typically have substantial storage requirements at the client end, and this results in set top boxes needing disks with high transfer rate capabilities. We present a permutation based pyramid scheme in which the storage requirements and disk transfer rates are greatly reduced, and yet the viewer latency is smaller as well. Under the proposed approach, each video is partitioned into contiguous segments of geometrically increasing sizes and each segment is further divided into blocks, where a block is the basic unit of transmission. As in the original pyramid scheme, frequencies of transmission for the different segments of a video vary in a manner inversely proportional to their size. Instead of transmitting the block in each segment in sequential order, the proposed scheme transmits these blocks in a prespecified cyclic permutation to save on storage requirements in the client end. Performance analyses are provided to quantify the benefits of the new scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3793/11111/00534963.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"126","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MMCS.1996.534963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMCS.1996.534963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=534963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A permutation-based pyramid broadcasting scheme for video-on-demand systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Videos","Bandwidth","Multimedia communication","Delay","Buffer storage","Performance analysis","Operations research","Broadcast technology","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive television","interactive video","television broadcasting","multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permutation based pyramid broadcasting scheme","video on demand systems","periodic broadcasting","near video on demand","bandwidth allocation","viewer latency time","storage requirements","set top boxes","transfer rate capabilities","disk transfer rates","prespecified cyclic permutation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-23 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"A permutation-based pyramid broadcasting scheme for video-on-demand systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5357960","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-23 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A permutation-based pyramid broadcasting scheme for video-on-demand systems","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"00534963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034462S","chronDate":"17-23 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3793","citationCount":"149","articleId":"534963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":534971,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The buffer manager is responsible for buffer replacement to free memory in order to accommodate new data blocks from the disk. An optimal buffer replacement algorithm is one which yields the lowest number of cache misses and, as a result, the lowest number of disk I/Os. In general, optimal buffer replacement algorithms require future knowledge, and therefore cannot be realized. Thus, most storage systems use approximation algorithms such as the least-recently-used (LRU) and most-recently-used (MRU) buffer replacement algorithms. In this paper, we show that both of these algorithms yield poor performance when they are used in storage systems that provide support for continuous media data. We present two new buffer replacement algorithms-BASIC and DISTANCE-which reduce the cache misses by up to 30% as compared to LRU and MRU. Furthermore, in the simulation experiments we conducted, our new algorithms resulted in at most a 9.7% increase in cache misses as compared to the optimal algorithm when the videos are sufficiently long (i.e. longer than 30 minutes). Moreover, we show that the DISTANCE scheme incurs an overhead which is comparable to those of the LRU and MRU schemes. Our conclusion is that DISTANCE is a very suitable candidate for a buffer replacement scheme in storage systems that deal with continuous media data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11111","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3793/11111/00534971.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MMCS.1996.534971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMCS.1996.534971","startPage":"172","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffer replacement algorithms for multimedia storage systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-23 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534971/","displayDocTitle":"Buffer replacement algorithms for multimedia storage systems","conferenceDate":"17-23 June 1996","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5352088","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer replacement algorithms for multimedia storage systems","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"00534971.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061717S","chronDate":"17-23 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3793","citationCount":"32","articleId":"534971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":534983,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

Since viewers may defect if they experience long waits, a good video scheduling policy needs to consider not only the batch size but also the viewer defection probabilities and wait times. Two conventional scheduling policies for batching are first-come-first-served (FCFS) and maximum queue length (MOL). Neither of these policies lead to entirely satisfactory results. MQL tends to be too aggressive in scheduling popular videos by only considering the queue length to maximize batch size, while FCFS has the opposite effect. We introduce the notion of factored queue length and propose a batching policy that schedules the video with the maximum factored queue length. We refer to this as the MFQ policy. The factored queue length is obtained by weighting each video queue length with a factor which is biased against the more popular videos. An optimization problem is formulated to solve the best weighting factors for the various videos. A simulation is developed to compare the proposed MFQ policy with FCFS and MQL. Our study shows that MFQ yields excellent empirical results in terms of standard performance measures such as average latency time, defection rates and fairness.","doi":"10.1109/MMCS.1996.534983","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3793/11111/00534983.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMCS.1996.534983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimal batching policies for video-on-demand storage servers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-23 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"On optimal batching policies for video-on-demand storage servers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5352099","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-23 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimal batching policies for video-on-demand storage servers","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"00534983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053066S","chronDate":"17-23 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3793","citationCount":"130","articleId":"534983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":534992,"authors":[{"name":"Yuh-Lin Chang","affiliation":["Matsushita Information Technology Laboratory, Panasonic Technologies, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Yuh-Lin Chang","id":"37350429200"},{"name":"Wenjun Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, USA"],"lastName":"Wenjun Zeng","id":"37286472700"},{"name":"I.

The goal of our research project is to develop a prototype system for automatic indexing of sports videos. The novelty of our work is that we propose to integrate speech understanding and image analysis algorithms for extracting information. The main thrust of this work comes from the observation that in news or sports video indexing, usually speech analysis is more efficient in detecting events than image analysis. Therefore, in our system, the audio processing modules are first applied to locate candidates in the whole data. This information is passed to the video processing modules, which further analyze the video. The final products of video analysis are in the form of pointers to the locations of interesting events in a video. Our algorithms have been tested extensively with real TV programs, and results are presented and discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/3793/11111/00534992.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"313","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Systems","doi":"10.1109/MMCS.1996.534992","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMCS.1996.534992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11111","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=534992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated image and speech analysis for content-based video indexing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech analysis","Data mining","Image analysis","Multimedia databases","Prototypes","Machine assisted indexing","Event detection","Information analysis","Testing","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia computing","information retrieval","interactive video","sport","audio-visual systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content based video indexing","multimedia database","automatic extraction","indexing information","raw data","video contents","automatic indexing","sports videos","speech understanding","image analysis algorithms","speech analysis","image analysis","audio processing modules","video processing modules","interesting events","real TV programs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/534992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-23 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"Integrated image and speech analysis for content-based video indexing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5357963","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-23 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated image and speech analysis for content-based video indexing","confLoc":"Hiroshima, Japan","sourcePdf":"00534992.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034066S","chronDate":"17-23 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3793","citationCount":"38","articleId":"534992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":535013,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The response is obtained by simulating an op amp using a SPICE circuit simulator. The response is then used to study the effect of transistor parameter mismatch on circuit performance. This technique models the parameter mismatch effect by creating an addition parameter term. The amount of deviation is a function of fabrication process, bias condition and device type (PMOS or NMOS). The integration method is illustrated in this paper. The modeling method allows parameter variation information to be shared by different nominal device models. The methodology discussed here can be applied to any new circuit topology; hence it is flexible. In addition, the sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative measure while keeping the number of required simulation to the minimum. Therefore, it is readily extended to design automation environment. A unity gain buffer CMOS op amp is used as an example to illustrate the concepts behind this technique.","doi":"10.1109/SOUTHC.1996.535094","publicationTitle":"Southcon/96 Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"Southcon/96 Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel5/3803/11131/00535094.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOUTHC.1996.535094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible parameter mismatch sensitivity analysis for VLSI design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535094/","displayDocTitle":"A flexible parameter mismatch sensitivity analysis for VLSI design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5399110","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible parameter mismatch sensitivity analysis for VLSI design","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00535094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038636S","chronDate":"25-27 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3803","articleId":"535094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":535110,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

However, parallel implementation depends on an appropriate structure in the coefficient matrix; for systems arising from discretization of the Poisson equation, a red-black ordering of the unknowns is suitable. One difficulty in utilizing SOR is the necessity of choosing a good value for the relaxation parameter, /spl omega/. We present a neural network for solving the Poisson equation applied to electrostatics. The neural network learns a good value for /spl omega/ as it solves the linear system. The algorithm is based on the standard parallel SOR method.

Statistical research investigates the nature of the variability of the speech waveform from a signal processing viewpoint. This approach relates to the processing of speech in order to obtain measurements of speech characteristics which demonstrate manageable variabilities across a wide range of the talker population, in the presence of noise or competing speakers as well as the interaction of speech with the channel through which it is transmitted, and under the inherent interaction of the information content of speech itself (i.e., the contextual factor). Physiological research aims at constructing accurate models of the articulatory and auditory process, helping to limit the signal space for speech processing. In the perceptual realm, work focuses on understanding the psychoacoustic and possibly the psycholinguistic aspects of the speech communication process that the human so conveniently conducts. By studying this working analysis/recognition system, insights may be garnered that will lead to improved methods of speech processing. Conversely by studying the limitations of this system, particularly how it reduces the information rate of the received signal through, for example, masking and adaptation improvements may be made in the efficiency of speech coding schemes without impacting the quality of the reconstructed speech. Thus comprehension of speech production and perception impacts methods of speech processing, and vice-versa. This paper enunciates such a position, focusing on how modern time-frequency signal analysis methods could help expedite needed advances in these areas.","doi":"10.1109/5.535241","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/11260/00535241.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.535241","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-frequency analysis and auditory modeling for automatic recognition of speech","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535241","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Time-frequency analysis and auditory modeling for automatic recognition of speech","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535241/","volume":"84","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5379183","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-frequency analysis and auditory modeling for automatic recognition of speech","sourcePdf":"00535241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128391S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"39","articleId":"535241","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":535256,"authors":[{"name":"I.J.

Wireless LANs have found homes in buildings where installing wires would expose asbestos or destroy historic architecture. They have also proved valuable to companies that often relocate and want networks they can take with them. Another common use is for connecting wired LANs that are physically separated. The growth has been fueled by the desire to add wireless adjuncts to wired LANs, so that mobile workers can keep in constant contact with corporate networks over short distances. The author discusses the befits of wireless LANs. The radio based wireless LAN is discussed including multipath interference and data bottlenecks.

In each case, a core, first order clock recovery circuit is realized by two gated ring oscillators, indirectly frequency-tuned by a phase-locked loop using a third replica oscillator and a local reference signal. Instantaneous phase locking is guaranteed by restarting the gated oscillators every time input data transitions occur. This method has been demonstrated to be precise enough to handle input data patterns containing hundreds of bits between transitions without errors. In addition, the circuit is small and dissipates low power. However, the recovered clock signal thus obtained inherits all jitter present in the input data signal. This shortcoming has been overcome in the present designs by two different methods. The results are the total elimination of jitter propagation and the generation of clean data and clock output signals. The first chip operates at 150 Mb/s. Since the data is demultiplexed into 8 channels, the local reference signal runs eight times slower than the transmission rate. This allows ample time for jitter-rejection processing. The second chip operates at 30 Mb/s without a demultiplexer. The jitter rejection is accomplished with an elastic store based on five 1 b registers.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535269","startPage":"44","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings ISSCC '95 - International Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3909/11339/00535269.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ISSCC '95 - International Solid-State Circuits Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"150/30 Mb/s CMOS non-oversampled clock and data recovery circuits with instantaneous locking and jitter rejection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","displayDocTitle":"150/30 Mb/s CMOS non-oversampled clock and data recovery circuits with instantaneous locking and jitter rejection","conferenceDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5125040","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535269/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"150/30 Mb/s CMOS non-oversampled clock and data recovery circuits with instantaneous locking and jitter rejection","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00535269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050595S","chronDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","isNumber":"11339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3909","citationCount":"12","articleId":"535269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":535273,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In the basic TPC scheme, by prohibiting the transmissions from the users with relatively high propagation loss to their connecting hub stations, the level of multiple access interference is decreased, and hence the throughput characteristics are improved. In the proposed schemes, the prohibition condition becomes more intelligent by considering the level of the offered traffic loads to the hub stations.

The ultra-thin gate oxide reliability was determined using tunnel current injection stressing measurements. A soft breakdown mechanism is demonstrated for these ultra-thin gate oxide layers. The soft breakdown phenomenon corresponds with an anomalous increase of the stress induced leakage current and the occurrence of fluctuations in the current. The soft breakdown phenomenon is explained by the decrease of the applied power during the stressing for thinner oxides so that thermal effects are avoided during the breakdown of the ultra-thin oxide capacitor. It is proposed that multiple tunnelling via generated electron traps in the ultra-thin gate oxide layer is the physical mechanism of the electron transport after soft breakdown. The statistical distributions of the charge to dielectric breakdown and to soft breakdown for a constant current stress of the ultra-thin oxides are compared. It is shown that for accurate ultra-thin gate oxide reliability measurements it is necessary to take the soft breakdown phenomenon into account.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5377822","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Soft breakdown of ultra-thin gate oxide layers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft breakdown of ultra-thin gate oxide layers","sourcePdf":"00535341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03871S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"272","articleId":"535341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535349,"authors":[{"name":"H.I.

The structure consists of a silicon field-effect transistor with nano-crystals of germanium or silicon placed in the gate oxide in close proximity of the inversion surface. Electron charge is stored in these isolated 2-5 nm size nano-crystals which are separated from each other by greater than 5 nm of SiO/sub 2/ and from the inversion layer of the substrate surface by less than 5 nm of SiO/sub 2/. Direct tunneling of charge from the inversion layer and its storage in the nano-crystal causes a shift in the threshold voltage which is detected via current sensing. The nano-crystals are formed using implantation and annealing or using direct deposition of the distributed floating gate region. Threshold shift of 0.3 V is obtained in Ge-implanted devices with 2 nm of SiO/sub 2/ injection layer by a 4 V write pulse of 300 ns duration. The nano-crystal memories achieve improved programming characteristics as a nonvolatile memory as well as simplicity of the single poly-Si-gate process.

There is, however, a distributed feedback provided through the opposite propagation directions of the signal and idler. The threshold pump intensities for the oscillators can be achieved by the lasers currently available based on quasi-phase matching in several structures.

Such a circuit configuration allows the combination of planar millimeter-wave M(H)MICs and NRD components in one system for the best use of different technologies.","doi":"10.1109/8.535377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/11263/00535377.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.535377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11263","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical and experimental investigations of aperture coupled unidirectional dielectric radiator arrays (UDRA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analytical and experimental investigations of aperture coupled unidirectional dielectric radiator arrays (UDRA)","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5377778","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical and experimental investigations of aperture coupled unidirectional dielectric radiator arrays (UDRA)","sourcePdf":"00535377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04011S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"11","articleId":"535377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":535387,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

As with previously reported fourth-order schemes, the methodology is founded on the principle that correction derivatives (i.e., three derivatives in time) can be converted into vector spatial derivatives. From the error analysis and phase-velocity data, it is argued that this approach will significantly minimize the dispersion errors while still maintaining minimal memory requirements. This claim is also supported by data obtained from FDTD simulations. Using a one-dimensional plasma slab problem as the test case, we show that the bandwidth and dynamic range associated with this fourth-order scheme are significantly improved with respect to its second-order counterpart. The impact of other error mechanisms, namely material boundary-related errors, is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/8.535387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/11263/00535387.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.535387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11263","startPage":"1283","endPage":"1289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A higher order FDTD method for EM propagation in a collisionless cold plasma","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A higher order FDTD method for EM propagation in a collisionless cold plasma","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535387/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5377788","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A higher order FDTD method for EM propagation in a collisionless cold plasma","sourcePdf":"00535387.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054377S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"53","articleId":"535387","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535396,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

CRDL reduces power consumption by utilizing a charge recycling technique with the speed comparable to those of conventional dynamic logic circuits. It has an additional benefit of improved noise margin due to inherently static operation. The noise margin problem of true single-phase-clock latch (TSPC) is also eliminated when a CRDL logic circuit is connected to it. Two swing-suppressed-input latches (SSILs), which are introduced for use with CRDL, have better performance than the conventional transmission gate latch. Moreover, a pipeline configuration with CRDL in a true two-phase clocking scheme shows completely race-free operation with no constraints on logic composition. Eight-bit Manchester carry chains and full adders were fabricated using a 0.8 /spl mu/m single-poly double-metal n-well CMOS technology to verify the relative performance of the proposed logic family.

We show that the energy of a processor depends on its performance, so we chose the energy-delay product to compare different processors. To improve the energy-delay product we explore methods of reducing energy consumption that do not lead to performance loss (i.e. wasted energy), and explore methods to reduce delay by exploiting instruction level parallelism. We found that careful design reduced the energy dissipation by almost 25%. Pipelining can give approximately a 2/spl times/ improvement in energy-delay product. Superscalar issue, however, does not improve the energy-delay product any further since the overhead required offsets the gains in performance. Further improvements will be hard to come by since a large fraction of the energy (50-80%) is dissipated in the clock network and the on-chip memories. Thus, the efficiency of processors will depend more on the technology being used and the algorithm chosen by the programmer than the micro-architecture.","doi":"10.1109/4.535411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/11273/00535411.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.535411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy dissipation in general purpose microprocessors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Energy dissipation in general purpose microprocessors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535411/","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5382687","volume":"31","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy dissipation in general purpose microprocessors","sourcePdf":"00535411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045481S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"350","articleId":"535411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":535412,"authors":[{"name":"H.

TMD can be exploited to reduce the signal voltage-swing and to realize a charge-recycling bus (CRB) architecture. This enables a dramatic power reduction without the throughput-loss due to time-multiplexing, while maintaining the same number of signal wires compared to a single signal line (SSL) scheme. This is because the differential transfer scheme inherently has a more capability in terms of throughput and noise tolerance compared to SSL. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TMD with DTD and TMD with CRB (TM-CRB), power consumption comparisons were made between SSL, the parallel architecture, TMD with DTD, and TM-CRB. For all measurements, the same throughput conditions were used based on the simulated and measured data of the 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS devices. This paper presents why TM-CRB can reduce the power dissipation on heavily loaded bus lines to less than 1/31 and 1/8, with bus activity of 100% and 25%, respectively, while maintaining the same number of signal wires, compared to SSL.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/11273/00535412.pdf","startPage":"1285","endPage":"1294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.535412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.535412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11273","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A signal-swing suppressing strategy for power and layout area savings using time-multiplexed differential data-transfer scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wires","Parallel architectures","Circuits","Throughput","Energy consumption","Threshold voltage","HDTV","Wiring","Random access memory","Bismuth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","system buses","time division multiplexing","integrated circuit layout","capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-swing suppressing strategy","bus capacitance imbalance","layout area savings","time-multiplexed differential data-transfer scheme","shared complementary wires","data-transition detector circuit","charge-recycling bus architecture","power reduction","power consumption comparison","0.5 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"A signal-swing suppressing strategy for power and layout area savings using time-multiplexed differential data-transfer scheme","volume":"31","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5382688","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signal-swing suppressing strategy for power and layout area savings using time-multiplexed differential data-transfer scheme","sourcePdf":"00535412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038297S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"5","articleId":"535412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":535414,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Most facsimile machines operating on public switched telephone networks use the Group 3 (G3) facsimile compression standards, in which images are entropy-coded. Although the synchronization codeword end of line (EOL) is employed, a transmission error in a codeword may cause the current codeword, the subsequent codewords in the current line, even the codewords in the subsequent lines to be misinterpreted, resulting in a great degradation of the received image. The objective of the proposed error detection and correction approaches is to completely or partially eliminate transmission errors in G3 facsimile images, requiring no extra transmission bit rate and without changing the transmitter and the receiver. The proposed approaches are based on the error checking conditions derived from the relationship between the current line and the previous line as well as the constraints on compressed image data. A corrupted line is detected if any of the error checking conditions is satisfied. When a corrupted line is detected, a sequence of bit inversions and redecoding operations are performed on the current corrupted line and/or its previous lines so that at least one possible (feasible) redecoding solution can be found. Then, the best solution is selected by using some selection criterion. Based on simulation results, the proposed approaches can recover the original or high-quality facsimile images from their corresponding corrupted facsimile images. This shows the feasibility of the proposed approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and correction of transmission errors in facsimile images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.535434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11250/00535434.pdf","startPage":"938","endPage":"948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.535434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Detection and correction of transmission errors in facsimile images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5371828","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and correction of transmission errors in facsimile images","sourcePdf":"00535434.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039341S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"10","articleId":"535434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":535435,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

The specific system analyzed consists of a Rayleigh-fading, diffuse multipath channel, with several data pulse shapes considered. An adaptive maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) algorithm based on the per-survivor processing (PSP) technique is analyzed and compared to an algorithm based on correct symbol feedback. The results show that significant performance degradation is suffered when suboptimal FE processing is used. Some of the issues which may complicate matters in practice are examined with an emphasis on application in packet mobile radio systems.

By using a multiple-symbol observation interval and a simple metric calculator, the power efficiency is improved over a receiver that uses a single-symbol observation interval. Performance bounds on the bit error probability are derived by defining a set of characteristic distances for CPM signals, and showing that TC-CPM is equivalent to a TCM scheme. Our results show that, with the same observation length, the proposed receiver is less than 0.5 dB inferior to a coherent receiver for which perfect channel information is needed.

The dual-mode structure consists of an auxiliary adaptive filter that estimates the channel during the training cycle. The converged filter weights are used to initialize a parallel bank of filters that are adapted blindly during the data cycle. When the symbol timing is known, this filter bank generates error residuals that are used to perform approximate maximum a posteriori symbol detection (MAPSD) and provide reliable decisions of the transmitted signal. For channels with timing jitter, joint estimation of the channel parameters and the symbol timing using an extended Kalman filter algorithm is proposed. Various methods are described to reduce the computational complexity of the MAP detector, usually at the cost of some performance degradation. Also, a blind MAPSD algorithm for combining signals from spatially diverse receivers is derived. This diversity MAPSD (DMAPSD) algorithm, which can be easily modified for the dual-mode TDMA application, maintains a global set of MAP metrics even while blindly tracking the individual spatial channels using local error estimates. The performance of these single-channel and diversity MAPSD dual-mode algorithms are studied via computer simulations for various channel models, including a mobile radio channel simulator for the IS-54 digital cellular TDMA standard.","doi":"10.1109/26.535438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.535438","endPage":"987","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11250/00535438.pdf","startPage":"976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive MAPSD algorithms for symbol and timing recovery of mobile radio TDMA signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535438/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive MAPSD algorithms for symbol and timing recovery of mobile radio TDMA signals","volume":"44","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"5371832","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive MAPSD algorithms for symbol and timing recovery of mobile radio TDMA signals","sourcePdf":"00535438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060054S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","articleId":"535438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":535440,"authors":[{"name":"T.R.

It is shown that the decoder may be implemented efficiently using a Viterbi algorithm which operates on a time-varying trellis with a number of states which is exponential in the product of the number of users in the system and the constraint length of the codes used (for the rate 1/2 code case). The asymptotic efficiency of this receiver relative to an uncoded coherent binary phase shift keying (BPSK) receiver (termed asymptotic multiuser coding gain, or AMCG) is then upper and lower bounded. The AMCG parameter unifies the asymptotic coding gain parameter and the asymptotic multiuser efficiency parameter which are traditional figure of merit parameters for single-user coded systems and multiuser uncoded systems, respectively.

A major technical factor is the channel response behavior (multipath) in the indoor environment as a function of the frequency band, building type and radio system architecture. The consequences of designing indoor wireless systems with directional antennas at one or both ends of a line-of-sight (LOS) link are investigated. We determine how narrow the beamwidth must be so that the maximum data rate is not limited by multipath effects. For such beamwidths, simple unequalized two-level frequency shift keying (FSK) or phase shift keying (PSK) modems can be used in place of the more costly and complex \"anti-multipath\" modems, and data rates above 1 Gb/s may be achieved. The channel impulse response in an empty room is estimated using geometrical optics, observing that with directional antennas, multipath rays must arrive from the same direction as the LOS ray. The link outage probability is then estimated as a function of the antenna beamwidth, and guidelines are established for the selection of the frequency band and antenna placement. Experiments using a 19-GHz 622-Mb/s binary phase shift keying (BPSK) link and 15/spl deg/ beamwidth horn antennas in an office building with plaster walls and large metallized windows have demonstrated error-free performance on both LOS and non-LOS (NLOS) links.","doi":"10.1109/26.535443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11250/00535443.pdf","startPage":"1034","endPage":"1043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.535443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gigabit/s indoor wireless systems with directional antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535443/","displayDocTitle":"Gigabit/s indoor wireless systems with directional antennas","volume":"44","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5371837","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gigabit/s indoor wireless systems with directional antennas","sourcePdf":"00535443.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036042S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","articleId":"535443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535444,"authors":[{"name":"C.

DCR chips reported are for constant-amplitude modulation systems such as FSK or GMSK. However, no DCR chip for QPSK systems has been reported yet,because a 2nd-order nonlinearity often strongly deteriorates a receiver sensitivity for QPSK systems. That is, amplitude modulation components in QPSK are converted down into spurious baseband signals, while FSK and/or GMSK systems do not suffer from 2nd-order nonlinearity. A DCR chip including an LNA is fabricated for a feasibility study of DCR for QPSK systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.9 GHz Si direct conversion receiver IC for QPSK modulation systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ISSCC '95 - International Solid-State Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535464","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings ISSCC '95 - International Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3909/11339/00535464.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","displayDocTitle":"A 1.9 GHz Si direct conversion receiver IC for QPSK modulation systems","conferenceDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5125071","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.9 GHz Si direct conversion receiver IC for QPSK modulation systems","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00535464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03633S","chronDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","isNumber":"11339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3909","citationCount":"44","articleId":"535464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":535469,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This wide bandwidth has been achieved by introducing a symmetric flexural resonance (sometimes called a \"flapping\" resonance) in the head-piece of the Tonpilz transducer. This flexural resonance is exploited by lip-mounting of the transducer as opposed to the more traditional nodal mount. Each transducer is characterized by high-power handling, high-electroacoustic efficiency, broad bandwidth (low-Q), and high-electromechanical coupling. These are characteristics which are usually associated with designs employing more complicated electrical or mechanical matching techniques. An array of these transducers was constructed and displays low-ripple (<3 dB) transmission of one-octave 20-40 kHz signals. A comparison with a recent broad-band design by Inoue et al. [1993] which uses a matching plate is also made to illustrate the inherent simplicity of the flexural resonance approach.","doi":"10.1109/58.535479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/11257/00535479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.535479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11257","startPage":"782","endPage":"790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiresonance design of a Tonpilz transducer using the finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiresonance design of a Tonpilz transducer using the finite element method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5378600","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiresonance design of a Tonpilz transducer using the finite element method","sourcePdf":"00535479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072723S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11257","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"32","articleId":"535479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535505,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

The trade-off between speed-and-gain in the design of the op amps is overcome by designing a simple and compact amplifier with a limited but precisely controlled gain. The finite gain effect is taken into account in the filter design by adjusting the capacitor ratio. In addition the filter uses nMOS-only switches therefore requiring a standard two-phase clock. Finally the clock-to-bandwidth ratio is equal to 10, so a fairly non-critical anti-aliasing filter is needed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5125103","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 150 Msample/s 20 mW BiCMOS switched-capacitor biquad using precise gain op amps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 150 Msample/s 20 mW BiCMOS switched-capacitor biquad using precise gain op amps","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00535527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031292S","chronDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","isNumber":"11339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3909","citationCount":"7","articleId":"535527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":535529,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It is strongly desired that camera systems in the future be adaptable to various applications in terms of the inter-operability among the applications. To meet this demand, this multi-use CCD can be used for various applications, by use of \"adaptive extraction of image area\".

Such file memories must have low power dissipation, high data transfer rate and low cost. A low chip-yield problem is reported to occur in the manufacture of large capacity DRAMs. To address both device requirements and yield limitations, new circuit technologies have been developed for 1 Gb DRAMs. By implementing a time-shared offset cancel sensing scheme and adopting a diagonal bit-line (DBL) cell, the chip size is reduced to 70% of that of a conventional DRAM. A defective word-line Hi-Z standby scheme and a flexible multi-macro architecture produces about twice the yield as that resulting from conventional architecture. 32 b I/Os with a pipeline circuit technique realizes a 400 MB/s data transfer rate.

With this architecture, both fast lock time and low jitter are achieved by the system transfer function being changed; it is unnecessary to vary the values of system parameters in an attempt to reduce lock time. The HSPLL uses a reconfigurable delay line (RDL) that, depending upon the state of its switch circuit (SC), can operate either as a voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL) or a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). When the RDL is operating as a VCDL (i.e. when the total circuit is a VCDL-PLL, a first-order system), lock time is fast and jitter is low, but it is difficult to generate a frequency-multiplied signal. This makes the VCDL-PLL configuration appropriate for the unlocked state. Then, at the instant that the HSPLL changes from the unlocked state to the locked, the condition of the SC is changed to create a VCO-PLL, a second-order system in which it is easy to generate a frequency-multiplied signal but difficult to achieve fast lock time (i.e. a situation well-suited to a locked state). This HSPLL architecture allows use of the respective advantages of both VCDL- and VCO-PLLs without having to suffer from their various disadvantages. The HSPLL is implemented in 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS and two-layer metal technology. 2010 transistors are integrated into a 480/spl times/450 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ die area.

Compared to other pipeline ADCs, a two-stage subranging flash architecture minimizes the number of analog and digital pipeline delays, but requires a large number of comparators in the coarse and fine flash converters to implement a high-resolution design. An architecture to implement the coarse and fine A/D converters requires only eleven absolute value or magnitude amplifiers, referred to as magamps, to realize a 12 b 50 MSample/s two-stage sub-ranging ADC. The gain alignment of the coarse and fine converters and the subtraction DAC rely on the statistical matching of the process, and 12 b linearity is obtained without laser trim. The ADC is fabricated on a high-speed dielectrically isolated complementary bipolar process that allows for more than 80 dB harmonic suppression up to an analog input frequency of 20 MHz while keeping the total ADC power dissipation at 575 mW from a single +5 V supply.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"12b 50MSample/s two-stage A/D converter","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ISSCC '95 - International Solid-State Circuits Conference","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535555","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings ISSCC '95 - International Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3909/11339/00535555.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","displayDocTitle":"12b 50MSample/s two-stage A/D converter","conferenceDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5131857","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"12b 50MSample/s two-stage A/D converter","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00535555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061685S","chronDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","isNumber":"11339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3909","citationCount":"23","articleId":"535555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":535556,"authors":[{"name":"A.

CCIR601 standards recommend the equi-ripple gain and group delay characteristics for filtering NTSC and PAL signals. Currently, these characteristics are approximated by expensive hybrids that are not programmable for various applications. This paper introduces a method for integrating such filters using current-mode transimpedance-based structures. A single-chip solution demonstrated here matches the requirements with less than /spl plusmn/0.25 dB gain ripple, /spl plusmn/20 ns group delay variation in the passband, and more than 40 dB attenuation in the stop band. The cut-off frequency, nominally set at 5.5 MHz, is continuously programmable over a decade. The IC can drive 2 Vpp signals into 75 /spl Omega/ load drawing 35 mA quiescent current. Comparable integrated filters using other techniques require substantially larger currents.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.1995.535563","startPage":"296","endPage":"297","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings ISSCC '95 - International Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/3909/11339/00535563.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ISSCC '95 - International Solid-State Circuits Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully-integrated continuous-time programmable CCIR 601 video filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","displayDocTitle":"A fully-integrated continuous-time programmable CCIR 601 video filter","conferenceDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5131865","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535563/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully-integrated continuous-time programmable CCIR 601 video filter","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00535563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028893S","chronDate":"15-17 Feb. 1995","isNumber":"11339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3909","citationCount":"7","articleId":"535563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":535564,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To understand circuit delay and power dissipation dependence on power supply voltage (V/sub DD/) and threshold voltage of MOSFETs (V/sub TH/), a typical logic circuit is investigated. Fanout is chosen to be 5 which corresponds to the statistical average of gate load in ASICs. A simulated delay dependence on V/sub DD/ and V/sub TH/ is presented. The same V/sub TH/ is chosen for nMOS and pMOS. It is shown that if V/sub TH/ is reduced to 0.3V, V/sub DD/ can be decreased down to 2V while maintaining the speed at V/sub TH/=0.7V and V/sub DD/=3V which is the typical operation condition for high-speed LSIs.

An equally important issue is how to use customer costs of electric supply interruptions as surrogates to appropriately quantify reliability worth. Postal or in-person surveys of electric customers are often used to determine interruption costs. The results obtained from the surveys are transformed into customer damage functions which are applicable to individual customer classes and sectors. Standard customer damage functions use aggregate or average customer costs for selected outage durations. This paper develops a practical alternative to the customer damage function method of describing the interruption cost data. The alternate technique, which is designated as the probability distribution approach, is capable of recognizing the dispersed nature of the data. The proposed probability distribution method is illustrated in this paper using the interruption cost data collected in a 1991 survey of the Canadian residential sector.","doi":"10.1109/59.535595","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/11253/00535595.pdf","startPage":"1236","endPage":"1244","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.535595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed nature of residential customer outage costs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Distributed nature of residential customer outage costs","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5372422","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed nature of residential customer outage costs","sourcePdf":"00535595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037305S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"25","articleId":"535595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535596,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The model is an on-off two-state model with the on period consisting of a sequence of document transmission requests from an individual subscriber. Actual traffic data with over 20000 data points was used to fit distributions to the model. The on and off periods are found to be of heavy-tailed Weibull and Pareto distributions, respectively. The inter-arrival times of requests within the on periods can be described with another Weibull distribution. This empirical model can be used as a realistic basis for network capacity planning for the future access networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1996.535600","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3816/11160/00535600.pdf","startPage":"1797","endPage":"1802 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1996.535600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical model of WWW document arrivals at access link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535600/","displayDocTitle":"Empirical model of WWW document arrivals at access link","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5443464","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical model of WWW document arrivals at access link","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00535600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042879S","chronDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3816","citationCount":"32","articleId":"535600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535605,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Second, it is shown that the proposed multirate multiuser receiver is considerably less complex than a low rate system with comparable information capacity.

Based on the observation of the impact of fading on the statistical properties of the multiple access interference, we include the fading channel multipath intensity profile in the Erlang capacity formula. In comparison with the previous work, a lower numerical value of the Erlang capacity is obtained for the current IS-95 system. The optimum multipath intensity profile to achieve the highest capacity is shown. A closed form expression for the required signal energy to interference power density ratio as a function of the number of transmission paths and receiver antennas is derived. To increase the system capacity, an artificial multipath transmission scheme is investigated using the new capacity formula.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3816/11160/00535607.pdf","startPage":"1829","endPage":"1833 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1996.535607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1996.535607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of fading on the Erlang capacity of the IS-95 CDMA cellular system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Multiaccess communication","Power control","Rayleigh channels","Base stations","Signal processing","Multiple access interference","Error analysis","Laboratories","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","fading","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","code division multiple access","channel capacity","receiving antennas","multipath channels","statistical analysis","telecommunication links","diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission diversity performance","IS-95 CDMA cellular system","fading effect","reverse link","statistical properties","optimum multipath intensity profile","multiple access interference","fading channel multipath intensity profile","closed form expression","signal energy to interference power density ratio","transmission paths","receiver antennas","system capacity","artificial multipath transmission","Erlang capacity formula","closed loop power control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","displayDocTitle":"The effect of fading on the Erlang capacity of the IS-95 CDMA cellular system","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5443470","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of fading on the Erlang capacity of the IS-95 CDMA cellular system","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00535607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052954S","chronDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3816","citationCount":"1","articleId":"535607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":535608,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Spread spectrum CDMA techniques have attracted much attention to be employed in such a system. Different techniques of CDMA could be used to map low, medium and high bit rate data into the same allocated bandwidth, including pure or broad-band CDMA, FDM/FH/CDMA, TDM/TH/CDMA or a hybrid of these systems. This paper investigates multi-rate broad band CDMA using multi-user interference statistics for both Gaussian and Rayleigh fading channels. Approximation of multi-user interference, in general, helps in theoretical approaches to error performance evaluation and, in particular, is quite useful for a simulation approach in a fading channel. Some results of a multi-rate broad-band CDMA with 2 services (low and high bit rates) is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1996.535608","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3816/11160/00535608.pdf","startPage":"1834","endPage":"1838 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1996.535608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multi-rate broad band CDMA in a fading channel using multi-user/multi-path interference approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535608/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multi-rate broad band CDMA in a fading channel using multi-user/multi-path interference approximation","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5443471","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multi-rate broad band CDMA in a fading channel using multi-user/multi-path interference approximation","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00535608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027283S","chronDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3816","citationCount":"2","articleId":"535608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":535609,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the forward traffic channels (from the base station to the mobiles), the speech encoder rate can be reduced to four different sub-rates, depending on the speech activity in the transmitter. At the receiver, the decoder does not know which one of the four speech encoder sub-rates the transmitter used. This paper focuses on the IS-95A system that uses the 13 kbps speech encoder and describes an algorithm to determine the encoder rate used for the transmitted sequence, with high confidence, so that the appropriate Viterbi decoder can be applied only once and not four times as is done by conventional decoders. This can reduce the overall decoder complexity by about a factor of two to fourteen, depending on the speech encoder sub-rate used. It can also reduce the power consumption in the decoder.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1996.535610","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICC/SUPERCOMM '96 - International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/3816/11160/00535610.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1996.535610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11160","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1848 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-rate detection for the IS-95A CDMA forward traffic channels using the 13 kbps speech coder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-rate detection for the IS-95A CDMA forward traffic channels using the 13 kbps speech coder","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535610/","conferenceDate":"23-27 June 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5443473","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-rate detection for the IS-95A CDMA forward traffic channels using the 13 kbps speech coder","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00535610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026343S","chronDate":"23-27 Jun 1996","isNumber":"11160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3816","citationCount":"7","articleId":"535610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535636,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Generators are equipped with automatic voltage regulators to cope with sudden and random voltage changes caused by natural load fluctuations or failures. Other devices like capacitors, inductors, transformers with on load tap changers are installed on the network. Faced with the evolution of the network and operating conditions, electricity utilities are more and more interested in overall and coherent control systems, automatic or not. These systems are expected to co-ordinate the actions of local facilities for a better voltage control (more stable and faster reaction) inside different areas of the network in case of greater voltage and VAr variations. They afford a better use of existing reactive resources. Also, installation of new devices can be avoided allowing economy of investment. With this in mind, EDF has designed a system called Co-ordinated Secondary Voltage Control (CSVC). It is an automatic closed loop system with a dynamic of a few minutes. It takes into account the network conditions (topology, loads), the voltage limits and the generator operating constraints. This paper presents improvements which allow the CSVC to control the voltage profile and different kinds of reactive means on a large-scale power system, Furthermore, this paper presents a solution to spread out investment costs over several years, considering a deployment gradually extended.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/11253/00535670.pdf","startPage":"1295","endPage":"1303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.535670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.535670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved voltage control on large-scale power system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Large-scale systems","Power system control","Power systems","Control systems","Investments","Power system dynamics","Regulators","Fluctuations","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage control","voltage regulators","closed loop systems","reactive power control","economics","power system control","investment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale power system","electric power transmission system","Co-ordinated Secondary Voltage Control","automatic closed loop system","VAr variations","reactive resources","voltage profile","investment costs","automatic voltage regulators","random voltage changes","sudden voltage changes","natural load fluctuations","capacitors","inductors","transformers","on load tap changers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","displayDocTitle":"An improved voltage control on large-scale power system","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5372428","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved voltage control on large-scale power system","sourcePdf":"00535670.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042403S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"141","articleId":"535670","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535672,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Using a dynamic model of the system, voltage stability is measured totally, considering a suitable stability index for the whole system, and locally, by defining appropriate voltage-margins for detecting the area of the system where the instability phenomenon arises. A three-layer feedforward neural network is trained to give, as outputs to a pre-defined set of input variables, the expected values of the above defined indices. The neural network is designed by using a fast learning strategy that allows the optimal number of hidden neurons to be easily determined. Moreover, it is shown that, in the operation mode, the system power-margin and the bus power-margins can be easily evaluated using the value of the voltage stability index given by the designed NN. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on the IEEE 118-bus test system.","doi":"10.1109/59.535674","startPage":"1332","endPage":"1341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.535674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11253","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/11253/00535674.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network-based method for voltage security monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535674/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network-based method for voltage security monitoring","volume":"11","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5372432","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network-based method for voltage security monitoring","sourcePdf":"00535674.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036543S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"35","articleId":"535674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":535675,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The Newton-Raphson (NR) method for evaluating the transformation matrices as smooth functions of frequency is introduced. A different technique which utilizes a conventional diagonalization algorithm and a correlation technique for tracking the order of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues is used to confirm the validity of the NR method. Transformation matrices for typical line configurations are evaluated and discussed. The paper concludes that the NR method is more efficient and appropriate for use in the time domain frequency-dependent line models in the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP).","doi":"10.1109/59.535695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.535695","endPage":"1546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/11253/00535695.pdf","startPage":"1538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-dependent transformation matrices for untransposed transmission lines using Newton-Raphson method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535695/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-dependent transformation matrices for untransposed transmission lines using Newton-Raphson method","volume":"11","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5372454","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-dependent transformation matrices for untransposed transmission lines using Newton-Raphson method","sourcePdf":"00535695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042145S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"112","articleId":"535695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535697,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

The mixture distribution is viewed as a contaminated Gaussian density. Using this model and the model-fitting (MF) estimator, we propose a recursive algorithm called the Gaussian mixture density decomposition (GMDD) algorithm for successively identifying each Gaussian component in the mixture. The proposed decomposition scheme has advantages that are desirable but lacking in most existing techniques. In the GMDD algorithm the number of components does not need to be specified a priori, the proportion of noisy data in the mixture can be large, the parameter estimation of each component is virtually initial independent, and the variability in the shape and size of the component densities in the mixture is taken into account. Gaussian mixture density modeling and decomposition has been widely applied in a variety of disciplines that require signal or waveform characterization for classification and recognition. We apply the proposed GMDD algorithm to the identification and extraction of clusters, and the estimation of unknown probability densities. Probability density estimation by identifying a decomposition using the GMDD algorithm, that is, a superposition of normal distributions, is successfully applied to automated cell classification. Computer experiments using both real data and simulated data demonstrate the validity and power of the GMDD algorithm for various models and different noise assumptions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.535841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11319","startPage":"1293","endPage":"1302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/11319/00535841.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian mixture density modeling, decomposition, and applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Gaussian mixture density modeling, decomposition, and applications","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5383926","pubMedId":"18285218","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian mixture density modeling, decomposition, and applications","sourcePdf":"00535841.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022976S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"117","articleId":"535841","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":535843,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A subband coder with jointly optimized multistage residual quantizers and entropy coders is introduced and applied to image coding. The high performance of the coder is attributed to its ability to exploit statistical dependencies within and across the subbands. The efficiency of the multistage residual quantization structure and the effectiveness of the statistical modeling algorithm result in an attractive balance among the reproduction quality, rate, and complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5383928","pubMedId":"18285220","displayDocTitle":"A jointly optimized subband coder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A jointly optimized subband coder","sourcePdf":"00535843.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076244S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"17","articleId":"535843","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":535846,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The analysis shows that standard regularization penalties induce space-variant local impulse response functions, even for space-invariant tomographic systems. Paradoxically, for emission image reconstruction, the local resolution is generally poorest in high-count regions. We show that the linearized local impulse response induced by quadratic roughness penalties depends on the object only through its projections. This analysis leads naturally to a modified regularization penalty that yields reconstructed images with nearly uniform resolution. The modified penalty also provides a very practical method for choosing the regularization parameter to obtain a specified resolution in images reconstructed by penalized-likelihood methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial resolution properties of penalized-likelihood image reconstruction: space-invariant tomographs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.535846","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/11319/00535846.pdf","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.535846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11319","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=535846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535846/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Spatial resolution properties of penalized-likelihood image reconstruction: space-invariant tomographs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5383931","pubMedId":"18285223","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial resolution properties of penalized-likelihood image reconstruction: space-invariant tomographs","sourcePdf":"00535846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04385S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"406","articleId":"535846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":535850,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These channels are then combined such that each combination, which we refer to as decomposition filter, results in zero-crossings at the locations of edges corresponding to different directions and resolutions, and inherently performs regularization against noise. By applying a zero-crossing detector on the outputs of the decomposition filters, edge maps of desired resolution and direction are obtained. In addition, with the application of the Teager's energy operator at the analysis stage, it is possible to obtain a reduction in unwanted zero-crossings.

The neural estimator is based on the use of an adaptive perceptron consisting of a linear adaptive neuron called Adaline. The learning parameters in the proposed algorithm are adjusted to force the error between the actual and desired outputs to satisfy a stable difference error equation. The estimator tracks the Fourier coefficients of the signal data corrupted with noise and decaying DC components very accurately. Adaptive tracking of harmonic components of a power system can easily be performed using this algorithm. Several numerical tests have been conducted for the adaptive estimation of harmonic components, total harmonic distortion and power quality of power system signals mixed with noise and decaying DC components.","doi":"10.1109/PEDES.1996.535876","startPage":"770","endPage":"775 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Power Electronics, Drives and Energy Systems for Industrial Growth","pdfPath":"/iel3/3837/11204/00535876.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Power Electronics, Drives and Energy Systems for Industrial Growth","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDES.1996.535876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power quality assessment using an adaptive neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power quality","Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Power system harmonics","Power harmonic filters","Difference equations","Harmonic distortion","Power system transients","Distortion measurement","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power supply quality","power system harmonics","harmonic distortion","power system analysis computing","adaptive estimation","perceptrons","Fourier analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power quality assessment","adaptive neural network","harmonic components estimation","power system signals","adaptive perceptron","Adaline linear adaptive neuron","learning parameters","algorithm","difference error equation","Fourier coefficients","adaptive tracking","total harmonic distortion","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/535876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Jan 1996","displayDocTitle":"Power quality assessment using an adaptive neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-11 Jan. 1996","accessionNumber":"5399385","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power quality assessment using an adaptive neural network","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"00535876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035696S","chronDate":"8-11 Jan 1996","isNumber":"11204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3837","citationCount":"4","articleId":"535876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":535878,"authors":[{"name":"D.H.

The ground conductivity plays a role in both the evaluation of the lightning radiated fields and of the line parameters. To be calculated by means of a rigorous theory, both fields and line constants need important computation time, which, for the problem of interest, is still prohibitive. The aim of this paper is to discuss and analyze the various simplified approaches and techniques that have been proposed for the calculation of the fields and the line constants when the ground cannot be assumed as a perfectly conducting plane. Regarding the radiated electromagnetic field, it is shown that the horizontal electric field, the component which is most affected by the ground finite conductivity, can be calculated in an accurate way using the Cooray-Rubinstein simplified formula. The presence of an imperfectly conducting ground is included in the coupling equations by means of two additional terms: the longitudinal ground impedance and the transverse ground admittance, which are both frequency-dependent. The latter can generally be neglected for typical overhead lines, due to its small contribution to the overall transverse admittance of the line. Regarding the ground impedance, a comparison between several simplified expressions used in the literature is presented and the validity limits of these expressions are established. It is also shown that for typical overhead lines the wire impedance can be neglected as regard to the ground impedance.","doi":"10.1109/15.536054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.536054","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/11258/00536054.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of a lossy ground on lightning-induced voltages on overhead lines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Influence of a lossy ground on lightning-induced voltages on overhead lines","volume":"38","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5371730","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536054/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of a lossy ground on lightning-induced voltages on overhead lines","sourcePdf":"00536054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078034S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"296","articleId":"536054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":536061,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The obtained results are compared with analytical and measured data in different configurations.","doi":"10.1109/15.536061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/11258/00536061.pdf","startPage":"318","endPage":"326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.536061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetic field attenuation of nonlinear shields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536061/","displayDocTitle":"Magnetic field attenuation of nonlinear shields","volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5371736","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetic field attenuation of nonlinear shields","sourcePdf":"00536061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038206S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"27","articleId":"536061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":536066,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The environment could be, for example, the interior of a car, a condition of exposure which is largely diffused nowadays. The presence of reflecting surfaces near the phone modifies the current distribution on, and the emitting properties of, the phone antenna. Therefore, the distribution of the absorbed power inside the head is different from that absorbed in the free space exposure condition. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been used to evaluate the SAR in a realistic anatomically based model of the human head for different antenna-handset configurations and for different antenna-head distances. The environmental effects have been simulated through partially or totally reflecting walls located in various positions with reference to the phone. It is found that the presence of a horizontal reflecting wall over the head decreases the SAR values in the part of the head directly exposed to the phone antenna, while it increases the SAR values in the part not directly exposed. On the contrary, the presence of a vertical wall, located in proximity of the phone and parallel to it, raises the SAR values everywhere into the head.","doi":"10.1109/15.536066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/11258/00536066.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.536066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11258","startPage":"357","endPage":"366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of the SAR distribution in the human head for cellular phones used in a partially closed environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the SAR distribution in the human head for cellular phones used in a partially closed environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5377837","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the SAR distribution in the human head for cellular phones used in a partially closed environment","sourcePdf":"00536066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071512S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"75","articleId":"536066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536068,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method can be employed to model radiation from printed circuit boards and shielding enclosures with complex geometries, but difficulties in modeling wires and cables of arbitrary radii are encountered. Modeling the wire by setting the axial component of the electric field to zero in the FDTD method results in an effective wire radius that is determined by the mesh discretization. Neglecting the wire radius in applications, such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) or printed circuit board modeling, may result in gross errors because near-field quantities are typically sensitive to wire thickness. Taflove et al. (1988) have developed a subcellular FDTD algorithm for modeling wires that has been shown to work well for plane wave scattering. The method uses a quasistatic field approximation to model wires with a well defined radius independent of the mesh dimensions. The wire model is reviewed and investigated for application to common-mode radiation from cables attached to printed circuit boards, where the source is often a noise voltage at the connector. Also investigated is energy coupling to attached cables through enclosure apertures resulting in common-mode radiation from the cable. The input impedance for a center-fed dipole antenna, as well as a monopole connected to a conducting half-sheet, is computed with FDTD methods and compared to moment method input impedance results. A simulation of a shielding enclosure with an attached cable demonstrates the utility of FDTD analysis in modeling common-mode radiation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/11258/00536068.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"387","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/15.536068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.536068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD modeling of common-mode radiation from cables","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Cables","Wire","Printed circuits","Solid modeling","Electromagnetic interference","Impedance","FCC","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","electromagnetic interference","cables (electric)","wires (electric)","printed circuits","electromagnetic shielding","packaging","approximation theory","electric impedance","dipole antennas","monopole antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["common-mode radiation","cables","FDTD modeling","printed circuit boards","shielding enclosures","FCC Class A limits","FCC Class B limits","finite difference time domain","FDTD method","center-fed dipole antenna","electric field","wire radius","mesh discretization","input impedance","EMI","near-field quantities","wire thickness","subcellular FDTD algorithm","plane wave scattering","quasistatic field approximation","wire model","noise voltage","monopole antenna","EMC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"FDTD modeling of common-mode radiation from cables","volume":"38","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5371742","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD modeling of common-mode radiation from cables","sourcePdf":"00536068.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038798S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"54","articleId":"536068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":536069,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This method utilizes near-field data to determine an equivalent magnetic current source over a fictitious surface which encompasses the antenna. This magnetic current, once determined, can be used to ascertain the near and the far fields. This method demonstrates that once the values of the electromagnetic field are known over an arbitrary geometry, its values for any other region can be obtained. An electric field integral equation is developed to relate the near fields to the equivalent magnetic current. A moment method procedure is employed to solve the integral equation by transforming it into a matrix equation. A least squares solution via singular value decomposition is used to solve the matrix equation. Computations with both synthetic and experimental data, where the near field of several antenna configurations are measured over various geometric surfaces, illustrate the accuracy of this method.","doi":"10.1109/15.536088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/11258/00536088.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.536088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11258","startPage":"536","endPage":"542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-field to near/far-field transformation for arbitrary near-field geometry, utilizing an equivalent magnetic current","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-field to near/far-field transformation for arbitrary near-field geometry, utilizing an equivalent magnetic current","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536088/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5377855","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-field to near/far-field transformation for arbitrary near-field geometry, utilizing an equivalent magnetic current","sourcePdf":"00536088.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029543S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"96","articleId":"536088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":536103,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Soo Han","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Seung-Soo Han","id":"37087291528"},{"name":"Li Cai","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Li Cai","id":"37860318900"},{"name":"G.S.

PECVD systems are controlled by many operating variables, including RF power, pressure, gas flow rate, reactant composition, and substrate temperature. The wide variety of processing conditions, as well as the complex nature of particle dynamics within a plasma, makes tailoring Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ film properties very challenging, since it is difficult to determine the exact relationship between desired film properties and controllable deposition conditions. In this study, silicon nitride PECVD modeling using neural networks has been investigated. The deposition of Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ was characterized via a central composite experimental design, and data from this experiment was used to train optimized feed-forward neural networks using the back-propagation algorithm. From these neural process models, the effect of deposition conditions on film properties has been studied. It was found that the process parameters critical to increasing hydrogenation and therefore enhancing carrier lifetime in polysilicon solar cells are temperature, silane, and ammonia flow rate. The deposition experiments were carried out in a Plasma Therm 700 series PECVD system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536103/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5366680","volume":"9","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling the growth of PECVD silicon nitride films for solar cell applications using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling the growth of PECVD silicon nitride films for solar cell applications using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00536103.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083627S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"25","articleId":"536103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":536114,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

By performing the motion estimation in the wavelet space, a quite modest computational complexity is ensured.","doi":"10.1109/30.536188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/11320/00536188.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.536188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11320","startPage":"800","endPage":"807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image compression using an overcomplete discrete wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image compression using an overcomplete discrete wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5378047","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression using an overcomplete discrete wavelet transform","sourcePdf":"00536188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062418S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"11","articleId":"536188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":536194,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Alturaigi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Alturaigi","id":"37344714400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"536194","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"abstract":"One of the most well-known adaptive algorithms that adjust conveniently the parameters of the TV ghost canceler is the least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The convergence rate of this algorithm is slow. In this paper a parallel processing technique to speed up the computation of the least square (LS) algorithm is studied. The technique is based on mapping the recursive modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm into two levels of linear systolic arrays. The arrays structure as well as the computation time are described. The performance of the system in terms of computational saving and the array utilization are evaluated. The system is shown to be composed of identical modules which makes it suitable for VLSI technology implementation.

The most popular class of verification methodologies, fault-injection, is fraught with a host of limitations. Methods which are rapid enough to be feasible are not based on actual hardware faults. On the other hand, methods which are based on gate-level faults require enormous time resources. This research tries to bridge that gap by developing a new fault-injection methodology for processors based on a register-transfer-language (RTL) fault model. The fault model is developed by abstracting the effects of low-level faults to the RTL level. This process attempts to be independent of implementation details without sacrificing coverage, the proportion of errors generated by gate-level faults that are successfully reproduced by the RTL fault model. A prototype tool, ASPHALT, is described which automates the process of generating the error patterns. The IBM RISC-Oriented Micro-Processor (ROMP) is used as a basis for experimentation. Over 1.5 million transient faults are injected using a gate-level model. Over 97% of these are reproduced with the RTL model at a speedup factor of over 500:1. These results show that the RTL fault model may be used to greatly accelerate fault-injection experiments without sacrificing accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/12.536231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/11374/00536231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.536231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11374","startPage":"881","endPage":"891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A methodology for the rapid injection of transient hardware errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A methodology for the rapid injection of transient hardware errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536231/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5382705","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A methodology for the rapid injection of transient hardware errors","sourcePdf":"00536231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041055S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"31","articleId":"536231","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":536245,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Cheng Hsu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chih-Cheng Hsu","id":"37348403600"},{"name":"W.W.

It supports the answering of conceptual image queries involving similar-to predicates, spatial semantic operators, and references to conceptual terms. Interested objects in the images are represented by contours segmented from images. Image content such as shapes and spatial relationships are derived from object contours according to domain specific image knowledge. A three layered model is proposed for integrating image representations, extracted image features, and image semantics. With such a model, images can be retrieved based on the features and content specified in the queries. The knowledge based query processing is based on a query relaxation technique. The image features are classified by an automatic clustering algorithm and represented by Type Abstraction Hierarchies (TAHs) for knowledge based query processing. Since the features selected for TAH generation are based on context and user profile, and the TAHs can be generated automatically by a clustering algorithm from the feature database, our proposed image retrieval approach is scalable and context sensitive. The performance of the proposed knowledge based query processing is also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5378928","volume":"8","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A knowledge-based approach for retrieving images by content","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A knowledge-based approach for retrieving images by content","sourcePdf":"00536245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036055S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"44","articleId":"536245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":536256,"authors":[{"name":"Chihping Wang","affiliation":["Informix Software, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chihping Wang","id":"37384350000"},{"name":"Ming-Syan Chen","affiliation":["Electrzcal Engineering Department, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Syan Chen","id":"37280976600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-4347"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2191"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3865"}],"articleNumber":"536256","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the complexity of distributed query optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536256","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Query processing","Data communication","Polynomials","Cost function","Marine vehicles","Interleaved codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed databases","query processing","optimisation","computational complexity","distributed databases","database theory","relational databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed query optimization","joins","semijoins","distributed query processing","NP-hardness","polynomial-time algorithms","optimization problem","binary decisions","sum product optimization","Knapsack","NP-completeness","problem transformation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/69.536256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel3/69/11375/00536256.pdf","startPage":"650","endPage":"662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.536256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11375","abstract":"While a significant amount of research efforts has been reported on developing algorithms, based on joins and semijoins, to tackle distributed query processing, there is relatively little progress made toward exploring the complexity of the problems studied. As a result, proving NP-hardness of or devising polynomial-time algorithms for certain distributed query optimization problems has been elaborated upon by many researchers. However, due to its inherent difficulty, the complexity of the majority of problems on distributed query optimization remains unknown. In this paper we generally characterize the distributed query optimization problems and provide a frame work to explore their complexity. As it will be shown, most distributed query optimization problems can be transformed into an optimization problem comprising a set of binary decisions, termed Sum Product Optimization (SPO) problem. We first prove SPO is NP-hard in light of the NP-completeness of a well-known problem, Knapsack (KNAP). Then, using this result as a basis, we prove that five classes of distributed query optimization problems, which cover the majority of distributed query optimization problems previously studied in the literature, are NP-hard by polynomially reducing SPO to each of them. The detail for each problem transformation is derived. We not only prove the conjecture that many prior studies relied upon, but also provide a frame work for future related studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5383800","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"On the complexity of distributed query optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the complexity of distributed query optimization","sourcePdf":"00536256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046123S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"26","articleId":"536256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":536271,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We show that GLVQ can behave incorrectly because its learning rates are reciprocally dependent on the sum of squares of distances from an input vector to the node weight vectors. Finally, we propose a new family of models-the GLVQ-F family-that remedies the problem. We derive competitive learning algorithms for each member of the GLVQ-F model and prove that they are invariant to all scalings of the data. We show that GLVQ-F offers a wide range of learning models since it reduces to LVQ as its weighting exponent (a parameter of the algorithm) approaches one from above. As this parameter increases, GLVQ-F then transitions to a model in which either all nodes may be excited according to their (inverse) distances from an input or in which the winner is excited while losers are penalized. And as this parameter increases without limit, GLVQ-F updates all nodes equally. We illustrate the failure of GLVQ and success of GLVQ-F with the IRIS data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5383833","pubMedId":"18263504","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Repairs to GLVQ: a new family of competitive learning schemes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repairs to GLVQ: a new family of competitive learning schemes","sourcePdf":"00536304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042365S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"49","articleId":"536304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":536305,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Chi Teng","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Chin-Chi Teng","id":"37087164324"},{"name":"B.W.

These mechanisms are used to reduce the number of hidden units of an ANN when trained by the cascade-correlation learning algorithm (CAS). Since CAS adds hidden units incrementally as learning proceeds, it is difficult to predict the number of hidden units required when convergence is reached. Further, learning must be restarted when the number of hidden units is larger than expected. Our key idea in this paper is to provide alternatives in the learning process and to select the best alternative dynamically based on run-time information obtained. Mixed-mode learning (MM), our first algorithm, provides alternative output matrices so that learning is extended to find one of the many one-to-many mappings instead of finding a unique one-to-one mapping. Since the objective of learning is relaxed by this transformation, the number of learning epochs can be reduced. This in turn leads to a smaller number of hidden units required for convergence. Population-based learning for ANN's (PLAN), our second algorithm, maintains alternative network configurations to select at run time promising networks to train based on error information obtained and time remaining. This dynamic scheduling avoids training possibly unpromising ANNs to completion before exploring new ones. We show the performance of these two mechanisms by applying them to solve the two-spiral problem, a two-region classification problem, and the Pima Indian diabetes diagnosis problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5383834","pubMedId":"18263505","volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automated learning for reducing the configuration of a feedforward neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated learning for reducing the configuration of a feedforward neural network","sourcePdf":"00536305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069356S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"16","articleId":"536305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":536306,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Chien Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Chi-Chien Lee","id":"37087283853"},{"name":"J.P. de Gyvez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"J.P.","lastName":"de Gyvez","id":"37266910700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"536306","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":507},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Color","Cellular neural networks","Application software","Neural network hardware","Software performance","Software prototyping","Image processing","Multi-layer neural network","Biomedical image processing","Image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","cellular neural nets","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color image processing","cellular neural networks","low-level hardware simulations","behavioral simulator","software prototype","multilayer structure","postprocessor","pixelwise logical operations","medical image processing","image restoration","weather forecasting"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536306","abstract":"When low-level hardware simulations of cellular neural networks (CNNs) are very costly for exploring new applications, the use of a behavioral simulator becomes indispensable. This paper presents a software prototype capable of performing image processing applications using CNNs. The software is based on a CNN multilayer structure in which each primary color is assigned to a unique layer. This allows an added flexibility as different processing applications can be performed in parallel. To be able to handle a full range of color tones, two novel color mapping schemes were derived. In the proposed schemes the color information is obtained from the cell's state rather than from its output. This modification is necessary because for many templates CNN has only binary stable outputs from which only either a fully saturated or a black color can be obtained. Additionally, a postprocessor capable of performing pixelwise logical operations among color layers was developed to enhance the results obtained from CNN. Examples in the areas of medical image processing, image restoration, and weather forecasting are provided to demonstrate the robustness of the software and the vast potential of CNN.","doi":"10.1109/72.536306","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1098","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.536306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/11388/00536306.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color image processing in a cellular neural-network environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536306/","displayDocTitle":"Color image processing in a cellular neural-network environment","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5383835","pubMedId":"18263506","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color image processing in a cellular neural-network environment","sourcePdf":"00536306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03851S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"33","articleId":"536306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":536307,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Moon Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Moon Park","id":"37087144523"},{"name":"Myeon-Song Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myeon-Song Choi","id":"37087215218"},{"name":"K.Y.

Additionally, the system is augmented with sliding control so as to ensure global stability if and when the state moves outside the region of state space spanned by the basis functions, and to ensure robustness to disturbances that arise due to the network inherent approximation errors and to the fact that for limiting the network size, a minimal number of basis functions are actually being used.

For off-line training, the proposed network and algorithm is able to achieve \"one-shot\" training as opposed to most iterative training algorithms in the literature. An online training algorithm is also presented. Similar to most of the backpropagation type of learning algorithms, the given algorithm also interpolates the training data. To eliminate outlier data which may appear in some erroneous training data, a robust weighted least squares method is proposed. The robust weighted least squares learning algorithm can eliminate outlier samples and the algorithm approximates the training data rather than interpolates them. The advantage of the designed network architecture is also mathematically proved.

It can be trained by the estimation-maximization (EM) or generalized EM (GEM) algorithms, considering state trajectories as missing data, which decouples temporal credit assignment and actual parameter estimation. The model presents similarities to hidden Markov models (HMMs), but allows us to map input sequences to output sequences, using the same processing style as recurrent neural networks. IOHMMs are trained using a more discriminant learning paradigm than HMMs, while potentially taking advantage of the EM algorithm. We demonstrate that IOHMMs are well suited for solving grammatical inference problems on a benchmark problem.

We use mutual information as a tool for comparing the performance of our rule with Kohonen's self-organizing (feature) map algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/72.536323","startPage":"1299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/11388/00536323.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.536323","endPage":"1305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topographic map formation by maximizing unconditional entropy: a plausible strategy for \"online\" unsupervised competitive learning and nonparametric density estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536323/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Topographic map formation by maximizing unconditional entropy: a plausible strategy for \"online\" unsupervised competitive learning and nonparametric density estimation","volume":"7","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5383852","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","pubMedId":"18263523","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topographic map formation by maximizing unconditional entropy: a plausible strategy for \"online\" unsupervised competitive learning and nonparametric density estimation","sourcePdf":"00536323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066611S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"27","articleId":"536323","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":536363,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The multimedia traffic needs to be delivered to end-systems, networks, and end-users in a form that they can handle while satisfying the constraints imposed by the multimedia application. Quality-of-service (QoS) mechanisms that can ensure full quality media playout at high-performance workstations, while at the same time providing appropriately filtered lower quality media for playout at other end-systems, are required. Existing multicast support mechanisms are deficient for this purpose, in a heterogeneous environment, because they work on a common denominator premise where the quality delivered depends on the least capable link or node involved in the multicast session. This paper begins by discussing video compression; it proposes and analyzes the use of filtering mechanisms as means of supporting disparate receiver capabilities and QoS requirements. The paper describes the implementation of a number of filtering mechanisms and highlights the communications architecture within which these mechanisms are built. This architecture constitutes a specific network topology and a new protocol family developed within a UNIX-like operating system.","doi":"10.1109/49.536366","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/11389/00536366.pdf","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.536366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filters: QoS support mechanisms for multipeer communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536366/","displayDocTitle":"Filters: QoS support mechanisms for multipeer communications","volume":"14","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5382308","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filters: QoS support mechanisms for multipeer communications","sourcePdf":"00536366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060036S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"87","articleId":"536366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":536367,"authors":[{"name":"K.

QoS parameters are translated between application and network requirements by the QoS broker, thus integrating media and network QoS management into a single entity. Admission control uses a schedulability test derived from application requirements. A novel task priority and precedence-based scheme is used to represent complex application requirements and ensure correct feasible schedules. A prototype of OMEGA has been implemented using workstations connected by a 155 Mb/s dedicated ATM local-area network (LAN). To simplify implementation, we assumed networked multimedia application with periodic media streams, specifically a master/slave telerobotics application. This application employs media with highly diverse QoS requirements (e.g., interarrival times, loss rate, and bandwidth) and therefore provides a good platform for testing how closely one can achieve QoS guarantees with workstation hosts and cell-switching. Experience with this implementation has helped to identify new challenges to extending these techniques to a larger domain of applications and systems, and suggests promising new research questions.","doi":"10.1109/49.536367","startPage":"1263","endPage":"1279","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/11389/00536367.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.536367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, implementation, and experiences of the OMEGA end-point architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Workstations","Local area networks","Streaming media","Quality of service","Admission control","Prototypes","Nonhomogeneous media","Master-slave","Telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","asynchronous transfer mode","local area networks","performance evaluation","telerobotics","scheduling","computer network management","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design","implementation","OMEGA end-point architecture","end-to-end quality-of-service","distributed applications","QoS broker","network QoS management","admission control","schedulability test","task priority and precedence-based scheme","feasible schedules","dedicated ATM local-area network","LAN","multimedia application","periodic media streams","master/slave telerobotics","cell-switching","155 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536367/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Design, implementation, and experiences of the OMEGA end-point architecture","volume":"14","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5382309","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, implementation, and experiences of the OMEGA end-point architecture","sourcePdf":"00536367.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0495S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"48","articleId":"536367","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":536381,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The new strategy establishes a link between the two modulations.

The subject matter raises interest due to the potential combination of two of the hottest topics in communications of the mid-1990s, but at the same time raises a natural question as to its viability, and sometimes even its desirability. In this article the authors survey potential applications of wireless ATM and describe what is usually meant by wireless ATM, why it may make sense, and some of the proposals to build systems based on it. The emphasis in this article is on the physical layer, the data link layer, and the access layer. The authors also present general observations on each of these layers, and some research solutions to these problems. Mobility issues and interoperability with the existing networks are addressed. Finally, the authors list some of the proposals to build wireless ATM systems from the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/11392/00536476.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/98.536476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.536476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11392","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless ATM: limits, challenges, and proposals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","ISDN","Asynchronous transfer mode","Standardization","Local area networks","FDDI","Wide area networks","Circuits","Communication standards","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open systems","asynchronous transfer mode","wide area networks","wireless LAN","subscriber loops","protocols","land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless ATM","viability","desirability","applications","physical layer","data link layer","access layer","mobility","interoperability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Wireless ATM: limits, challenges, and proposals","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5386646","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless ATM: limits, challenges, and proposals","sourcePdf":"00536476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046072S","chronDate":"Aug 1996","isNumber":"11392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"115","articleId":"536476","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":536477,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Access is via a radio system with carrier frequencies within the 20 to 60 GHz range, because of the relative abundance of available bandwidth in this range. The system design is shaped by a set of service requirements, by the characteristics of indoor millimeter wave radio channels, and by the constraints and opportunities of the relevant device technologies. The design includes a multi-access microcellular architecture accommodating ATM traffic with a wide range of broadband and narrowband bit rates and services in an office environment. A modern configuration incorporating bandwidth spreading, signal processing, and coding measures to provide immunity to the effects of radio channel fading, multipath, shadowing, interference and noise, and millimeter-wave component limitations has been developed.

The reference architecture for wireless ATM consists of two major components: (a) a \"radio access layer\" for extension of ATM services over a wireless medium and (b) a \"mobile ATM\" infrastructure network capable of supporting terminal migration. Design considerations for both the radio access layer (e.g. physical layer, medium access control and data link control) and mobile ATM (e.g. handoff control, location management and routing/QoS control) are discussed, and key technical issues are identified in each case.

While the modeling of VBR video sources has received significant attention, there is no widely accepted model which lends itself to mathematical analysis. Furthermore, new video compression standards are emerging, such as the MPEG family. A detailed statistical analysis of a long sample of a movie encoded with an MPEG-1 algorithm highlights that traffic generated by an MPEG-1 encoder has both a high degree of burstiness (peak/average ratio greater than five) and a strong long-term correlation (positive correlation lasts for ten/twenty minutes). In this paper, we propose and analyze a Markov model which captures both the burstiness and the temporal dependencies of MPEG traffic. Furthermore, we show that our model is a flexible traffic generator which is suitable for studying statistical multiplexing issues. Specifically, we study both the multiplexing of a VBR video source with low priority traffic and the multiplexing of several VBR video sources. The results obtained show that the long-term correlation significantly affects the tail of the delay distribution even for lightly loaded networks. The presence of a long range dependence in the MPEG traffic significantly reduces the gain in terms of network utilization which can be achieved with statistical multiplexing of i.i.d. sources.","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/11389/00536491.pdf","startPage":"1455","endPage":"1471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.536491","doi":"10.1109/49.536491","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536491","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Traffic control","Video compression","Mathematical model","Telecommunication traffic","Large-scale systems","B-ISDN","Mathematical analysis","Statistical analysis","Motion pictures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","source coding","telecommunication standards","statistical analysis","telecommunication traffic","variable rate codes","correlation methods","Markov processes","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MPEG-1 correlations","video-sources statistical multiplexing","variable bit-rate video","broadband-integrated services networks","B-ISDN","VBR video sources","video compression standards","MPEG","statistical analysis","movie","burstiness","traffic","Markov model","traffic generator","delay distribution","network utilization","long range dependence","i.i.d. sources","independent identically distributed sources"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536491/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Study of the impact of MPEG-1 correlations on video-sources statistical multiplexing","accessionNumber":"5382321","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","volume":"14","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of the impact of MPEG-1 correlations on video-sources statistical multiplexing","sourcePdf":"00536491.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049068S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"29","articleId":"536491","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":536496,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

An algorithm is described to obtain the slope correction from a SAR interferogram, which also enables retrieval of the full scattering geometry. Since the SAR image and interferogram are derived from the same data set, there is no need to match the image with the calibration data. There is also no need for phase unwrapping since the algorithm only uses the fringe frequencies. A maximum-likelihood estimator for the fringe frequency is analyzed and the algorithm is illustrated by processing ERS-1 SAR data. The example demonstrates that the spatial resolution and calibration error are adequate for most applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5395497","displayDocTitle":"Radiometric slope correction of synthetic-aperture radar images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiometric slope correction of synthetic-aperture radar images","sourcePdf":"00536527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066806S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"158","articleId":"536527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":536528,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The technique is computationally much less expensive than previous profiling schemes and has been designed specifically to allow for tractability of assumptions. In this paper, the emphasis is placed upon passive microwave applications, but the combination of passive with active microwave sensors, infrared sensors, or other a priori information can be adapted easily to the framework described. The technique is based upon a Bayesian approach. The authors use many realizations of the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model to establish a prior probability density function of rainfall profiles. Detailed three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations are used to determine the upwelling brightness temperatures from the cloud model to establish the similarity of radiative signatures and thus the probability that a given profile is actually observed. In this study, the authors show that good results may be obtained by weighting profiles from the prior probability density function according to their deviation from the observed brightness temperatures. Examples of the retrieval results are shown for oceanic as well as land situations. Microwave data from the Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) instrument are used to illustrate the retrieval structure results for high-resolution data while SSM/I is used to illustrate satellite applications. Simulations are performed to compare the expected retrieval performance of the SSM/I instrument with that of the upcoming TMI instrument aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) to be launched in August 1997. These simulations show that correlations of /spl sim/0.77 may be obtained for 10-km retrievals of the integrated liquid water content based upon SSM/I channels. This correlation increases to /spl sim/0.90 for the same retrievals using the TMI channels and resolution. Due to the lack of quantitative validation data, hydrometeor profiles cannot be compared directly but are instead converted to an equivalent reflectivity structure and compared to existing radar observations where possible.","doi":"10.1109/36.536538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.536538","endPage":"1232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/11515/00536538.pdf","startPage":"1213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplified scheme for obtaining precipitation and vertical hydrometeor profiles from passive microwave sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536538/","displayDocTitle":"A simplified scheme for obtaining precipitation and vertical hydrometeor profiles from passive microwave sensors","volume":"34","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5395508","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplified scheme for obtaining precipitation and vertical hydrometeor profiles from passive microwave sensors","sourcePdf":"00536538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047504S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"396","articleId":"536538","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536542,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Using P-band data, tests of this technique have been made for an area in the Black Forest near Villingen/Schwenningen in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. The radar measured slope and derived elevation profiles have low rms errors and high correlation values when compared with a stereo-photograph digital-elevation map (DEM) for the area. This algorithm is capable of adaptively making transitions from the forested areas to nearby regions with open-terrain. Subsequent tests of the algorithm have been conducted using polarimetric SAR L-band data for a mountainous, nonforested, region in the Mojave Desert (Ft. Irwin, CA) where an accurate DEM also was available. Complete elevation and slope mapping of the terrain in two dimensions using this technique is possible when azimuthal elevation profiles are produced throughout the range extent of the SAR image.","doi":"10.1109/36.536542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/11515/00536542.pdf","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.536542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of topography using polarimetric SAR images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536542/","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of topography using polarimetric SAR images","volume":"34","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395512","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of topography using polarimetric SAR images","sourcePdf":"00536542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055891S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"114","articleId":"536542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":536543,"authors":[{"name":"C.Y.

Simulation results show that stereo sound signals interfere with a multiplexing signal under multipath conditions. LMSK (level controlled MSK) is proposed as a modulation scheme to ensure good transmission quality. It is shown that an error correction scheme using a product code of (272190) codes has a good performance for mobile reception. Field tests on the DARC for mobile reception are conducted in the service area of the NHK Tokyo FM station.

Regarding program production, a digital outside-broadcasting-link (OBL), in particular, from mobile source is required to gather digital video and audio sources in severe multipath environments. The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme is robust under multipath fading conditions. A digital OFDM modem for OBL in the 800 MHz band has been developed to enable stable transmission of digital sources from moving vehicles. In the experimental OFDM-OBL, the compressed digital video and audio data are distributed to 572 carriers in the 9 MHz bandwidth, using differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) modulation for each carrier. In computer simulation and indoor/outdoor experiments, it is confirmed that digital OFDM-OBL can stably transmit signals, even under severe multipath fading conditions, while pictures transmitted with conventional FM-OBL are seriously degraded. This paper describes the features of the OFDM modem for the digital OBL which transmits program sources from moving vehicles, and also discusses aspects of gathering digital program sources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital outside-broadcasting-link using OFDM modulation scheme","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","doi":"10.1109/11.536590","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/11398/00536590.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.536590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Digital outside-broadcasting-link using OFDM modulation scheme","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5388228","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital outside-broadcasting-link using OFDM modulation scheme","sourcePdf":"00536590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056806S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"3","articleId":"536590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":536594,"authors":[{"name":"O.W.

As a result, the SFDTD approach is shown to be generally effective and robust for resonant structures.","doi":"10.1109/22.536612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/11400/00536612.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.536612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11400","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of the spatial finite-difference and temporal differential (SFDTD) formulation to cylindrical structure problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of the spatial finite-difference and temporal differential (SFDTD) formulation to cylindrical structure problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536612/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5388245","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of the spatial finite-difference and temporal differential (SFDTD) formulation to cylindrical structure problems","sourcePdf":"00536612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070711S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"2","articleId":"536612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536613,"authors":[{"name":"Joong Chang Chun","affiliation":["Korea Telecom, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joong Chang Chun","id":"38253504500"},{"name":"Wee Sang Park","affiliation":["Microwave Application Research Center, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wee Sang Park","id":"37290799200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"536613","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Patch antennas","Feeds","Integrated circuit interconnections","Microwave circuits","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip discontinuities","S-parameters","finite difference time-domain analysis","equivalent circuits","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double step microstrip discontinuity","substrate","3D FDTD method","finite-difference time-domain method","thickness changes","longitudinal direction","patch antenna feeds","interconnections","microwave planar circuit modules","equivalent circuit","scattering parameters"]}],"abstract":"The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been applied to the analysis of a double step microstrip discontinuity having thickness changes in the longitudinal direction.

The packaging technique uses low-temperature (320/spl deg/C) electrostatic bonding of a custom-made glass capsule (Corning 7740, 2/spl times/2/spl times/8 mm/sup 3/) to fine grain polysilicon in order to form a hermetically sealed cavity. High-density on-chip multiple polysilicon feedthroughs (200 per millimeter) are used for connecting external sensors and actuators to the electronic circuitry inside the package. A high degree of planarity over feedthrough areas is obtained by using grid-shaped polysilicon feedthrough lines that are covered with phosphosilicate glass (PSG), which is subsequently reflown at 1100/spl deg/C in steam for 2 h. Saline and DI water soak tests at elevated temperatures (85 and 95/spl deg/C) were performed to determine the reliability of the package. Preliminary results have shown a mean time to failure (MTTF) of 284 days and 118 days at 85 and 95/spl deg/C, respectively, in DI water. An Arrhenius diffusion model for moisture penetration yields an expected lifetime of 116 years at body temperature (37/spl deg/C) for these packages. In vivo tests in guinea pigs and rats for periods ranging from one to two months have shown no sign of infection, inflammation, or tissue abnormality around the implanted package.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5383920","displayDocTitle":"A hermetic glass-silicon micropackage with high-density on-chip feedthroughs for sensors and actuators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hermetic glass-silicon micropackage with high-density on-chip feedthroughs for sensors and actuators","sourcePdf":"00536623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11221S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"101","articleId":"536623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536640,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Summerfield","affiliation":["Australian Photonics Cooperative Research Centre, Photonics Research Laboratory Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Summerfield","id":"37265300700"},{"name":"R.S.

We demonstrate that there is an input pump power at which the noise figure of the frequency converter is a minimum, and a corresponding input signal power for which the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a maximum. We report bit-error-rate measurements which show that there is a trade-off between maximizing the output SNR, and minimizing intersymbol interference in the SOA.

Then the performance of the WTAF is studied by the help of learning curves for three different convergence factors: (1) constant convergence factor, (2) time-varying convergence factor, and (3) exponentially weighted convergence factor. The exponentially weighted convergence factor is proposed to introduce scale-based variation to the weight update equation.

The analysis holds under mild assumptions on the inputs and the cost function. The method of analysis is based on an asymptotic analysis of fixed stepsize adaptive algorithms and gives almost sure results regarding the behavior of the parameter estimates, whereas previous stochastic analyses typically considered mean and mean square behavior. The parameter estimates are shown to enter a small neighborhood about the optimum value and remain there for a finite length of time. Furthermore, almost sure exponential bounds are given for the rate of convergence of the parameter estimates. The asymptotic distribution of the parameter estimates is shown to be Gaussian with mean equal to the optimum value and covariance matrix that depends on the input statistics. Specific adaptive algorithms that fall under the framework of this paper are signed error least mean square (LMS), dual sign LMS, quantized state LMS, least mean fourth, dead zone algorithms, momentum algorithms, and leaky LMS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11401/00536676.pdf","startPage":"2186","endPage":"2194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.536676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.536676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of stochastic gradient-based adaptive filtering algorithms with general cost functions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Adaptive filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Parameter estimation","Least squares approximation","Adaptive algorithm","Cost function","Convergence","Covariance matrix","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","least mean squares methods","stochastic processes","adaptive filters","parameter estimation","covariance matrices","Gaussian distribution","Gaussian processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic analysis","stochastic gradient-based adaptive filtering algorithms","fixed stepsize adaptive algorithms","parameter estimate","optimum value","exponential bounds","convergence","symptotic distribution","Gaussian","covariance matrix","input statistics","error least mean square","dual sign LMS","quantized state LMS","least mean fourth","dead zone algorithms","momentum algorithms","leaky LMS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic analysis of stochastic gradient-based adaptive filtering algorithms with general cost functions","volume":"44","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5389837","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic analysis of stochastic gradient-based adaptive filtering algorithms with general cost functions","sourcePdf":"00536676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039565S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"34","articleId":"536676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":536680,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

We proposed a new class of fast subspace tracking (FST) algorithms that overcome these problems by exploiting the matrix structure inherent in multisensor processing. These algorithms simultaneously track an orthonormal basis for the signal subspace and preserve signal eigenstructure information while requiring only O(Nr) operations per update (where N is the number of channels, and r is the effective rank). Because of their low computational complexity, these algorithms have applications in both recursive and block data processing. Because they preserve the signal eigenstructure as well as compute an orthonormal basis for the signal subspace, these algorithms may be used in a wide range of sensor array applications including bearing estimation, beamforming, and recursive least squares. We present a detailed description of the FST algorithm and its rank adaptive variation (RA-FST) as well as a number of enhancements. We also demonstrate the FST's rapid convergence properties in a number of application scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/78.536680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11401","startPage":"2229","endPage":"2244","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11401/00536680.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.536680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast, rank adaptive subspace tracking and applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Sensor arrays","Array signal processing","Least squares approximation","Matrix decomposition","Computational complexity","Direction of arrival estimation","Real time systems","Data processing","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","adaptive signal processing","recursive estimation","least squares approximations","computational complexity","convergence of numerical methods","tracking","matrix algebra","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rank adaptive subspace tracking","computational complexity","subspace based algorithms","real-time systems","fast subspace tracking algorithms","matrix structure","multisensor processing","orthonormal basis","signal subspace","signal eigenstructure information","block data processing","recursive data processing","sensor array applications","bearing estimation","beamforming","recursive least squares","FST algorithm","rank adaptive FST algorithm","adaptive array processing","parallel algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Fast, rank adaptive subspace tracking and applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5389841","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast, rank adaptive subspace tracking and applications","sourcePdf":"00536680.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032405S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"71","articleId":"536680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":536681,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The FML algorithm was motivated by the desire to analyze data that have many closely spaced components, such as the NMR spectroscopy data of human blood plasma. The computational efficiency of FML lies in reducing the multidimensional search involved in ML estimation into multiple 1-D searches. This is achieved by using our knowledge of the shape of the compressed likelihood function (CLF) in the parameter space. The proposed FML algorithm is an iterative method that decomposes the original data into its constituent signal components and estimates the parameters of the individual components efficiently using our knowledge of the shape of the CLF. The other striking features of the proposed algorithm are that it provides procedures for initialization, has a fast converging iteration stage, and makes use of the information extracted in preliminary iterations to segment the data suitably to increase the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The computational complexity and the performance of the proposed algorithm are compared with other existing methods such as those based on linear prediction, KiSS/IQML, alternating projections (AP), and expectation-maximization (EM).","doi":"10.1109/78.536681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.536681","startPage":"2245","endPage":"2259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11401/00536681.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of parameters of exponentially damped sinusoids using fast maximum likelihood estimation with application to NMR spectroscopy data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of parameters of exponentially damped sinusoids using fast maximum likelihood estimation with application to NMR spectroscopy data","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5389842","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536681/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of parameters of exponentially damped sinusoids using fast maximum likelihood estimation with application to NMR spectroscopy data","sourcePdf":"00536681.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046872S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","articleId":"536681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":536695,"authors":[{"name":"M.G.

After a RAM chip is reconfigured, physically adjacent spare cells may no longer have consecutive logical addresses.

Test algorithms used to test reconfigured RAM's and scrambled address RAM's for the detection of physical neighborhood pattern sensitive faults have to consider that the physical and logical neighborhoods are different and that the address mapping of the reconfigured RAM is no longer available. In this paper, we present a test algorithm that detects static five-cell physical neighborhood pattern sensitive faults in reconfigured RAMs and RAMs with scrambled address lines.

For difficult faults, the computation of global implications is iterated, which finds more implications than previous approaches and subsumes structural heuristics such as unique sensitization. Without random tests or fault simulation, TEGUS completes on every fault in the ISCAS networks, demonstrating its robustness, and is ten times faster for those networks which have been completed by previous algorithms.

The objective is to minimize the rectangular area of the entire layout. By formulating the problem appropriately, it becomes a geometric programming problem.

This paper presents a rational approach to construct thermal circuit networks equivalent to a discretization of the heat equation by the finite element method. Elemental thermal circuit networks are developed, which correspond to the linear and cubic Hermite elements in the 1-D case, to the triangular and rectangular elements in the 2-D case, and to the tetrahedral and cube elements in the 3-D case. These thermal circuit networks are to be connected to the electrical networks of power electronic systems to provide complete electrothermal models that can be conveniently used in any circuit simulator package.

The design equations are derived using the time-domain analysis and Fourier series technique. The rectifier operates as a full-wave rectifier with two diodes and a one-secondary winding transformer overcoming the limitations of class D current-driven full-bridge and center-tapped rectifiers and preserving their advantages. The rectifier operates with lower conduction losses than the center tapped rectifier. Moreover, the diodes turn on at zero di/sub D//dt, low d/spl nu//sub D//dt, and turn off at low di/sub D//dt. As a consequence, switching losses are reduced and this rectifier is suitable for a high-frequency and high-efficiency operation. Integrated inductors can be used to reduce the size, volume, and cost of the circuit. A breadboard of the rectifier was designed and tested for a constant output voltage V/sub 0/=12 V, and an output current I/sub 0/ ranging from no-load to 12 A. The rectifier was driven by an off-line AC-AC converter operated at an input r.m.s. voltage varying from 176-270 V and a minimum frequency of 550 kHz. The predicted results are in good agreement with those measured. A full-load efficiency of 89.4% was achieved for the entire AC-DC converter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zero current switching","Rectifiers","Diodes","Voltage","Equations","Time domain analysis","Fourier series","Switching loss","Inductors","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rectifying circuits","AC-DC power convertors","Fourier series","losses","switching circuits","nonlinear network analysis","nonlinear network synthesis","time-domain analysis","equivalent circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-driven two-inductor rectifier","ZCS full-wave rectifier","zero-current-switching","design equations","time-domain analysis","Fourier series technique","conduction losses","switching losses reduction","high-frequency operation","high-efficiency operation","AC-DC converter","12 V","176 to 270 V","550 kHz","89.4 percent","0 to 12 A"]}],"doi":"10.1109/81.536744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/11403/00536744.pdf","startPage":"745","endPage":"759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.536744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of a current-driven two-inductor ZCS low di/sub D//dt full-wave rectifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of a current-driven two-inductor ZCS low di/sub D//dt full-wave rectifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536744/","volume":"43","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5389899","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of a current-driven two-inductor ZCS low di/sub D//dt full-wave rectifier","sourcePdf":"00536744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053125S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"8","articleId":"536744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":536747,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

In this paper, we focus on digit-serial, high-speed architectures with programmable coefficients. To achieve high performance goals, we consider both of algorithm level and architecture implementation level of FIR filters. In algorithm level, we reformulate the FIR formulation in bit-level and take the associative property of the addition in both the digit-serial multiplications and filter formulations. In architecture level, we considered issues to implement the reformulated results efficiently. The issues include addition implementation, data flow arrangements, and treatment of sign-extensions. Based on the above considerations, we can obtain a filter architecture with accumulation-free tap structure and properties of short latency, flexible pipelinability and high speed. Comparing the cost and performance with previous designs, we find that the proposed architecture reduces the hardware cost of a programmable FIR filter to only half that of previous designs without sacrificing performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/11460/00536760.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.536760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.536760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new hardware-efficient architecture for programmable FIR filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Costs","Delay","Signal processing algorithms","Hardware","Digital signal processing","Very large scale integration","Video signal processing","Pulse shaping methods","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","programmable filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-efficient architecture","programmable FIR filter","high-speed architecture","algorithm","design","bit-level","digit-serial multiplication","data flow","sign-extension","addition","accumulation-free tap structure","latency","pipelinability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"A new hardware-efficient architecture for programmable FIR filters","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5403667","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new hardware-efficient architecture for programmable FIR filters","sourcePdf":"00536760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057306S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"34","articleId":"536760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":536763,"authors":[{"name":"H.O.

The linear displacement, angular velocity, and linear acceleration of the foot, shank, and thigh segments were directly measured using three IKSs. The results clearly showed the heel strike impact in both walking and running, illustrating the high frequency components that exist in those activities. This paper illustrates the limitations of standard position measurements to capture transients associated with phase transitions, not only in acceleration estimates, but also in the determination of segmental angular velocities. An error analysis was conducted to determine the relative contribution of the accelerometer and the angular rate sensor to the determination of the segmental center of mass (COM) acceleration. The results suggest that in practical kinesiological applications, adding either an accelerometer or an angular rate sensor can remarkably increase the accuracy of segmental COM-acceleration estimates.","doi":"10.1109/86.536775","startPage":"193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/11404/00536775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.536775","endPage":"200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The study of kinematic transients in locomotion using the integrated kinematic sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","displayDocTitle":"The study of kinematic transients in locomotion using the integrated kinematic sensor","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5390378","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","pubMedId":"8800223","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The study of kinematic transients in locomotion using the integrated kinematic sensor","sourcePdf":"00536775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044966S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"31","articleId":"536775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":536776,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

These involve: (1) a \"pull\" test in which the limb is slowly moved throughout its range of motion while measuring angles (with an electrogoniometer) and torques (with a hand-held dynamometer) to determine passive stiffness and (2) a \"pendulum\" test in which the limb is moved against gravity and then dropped, while again measuring angles and torques. By limiting the extent of the movement and choosing a direction (flexion or extension) that minimizes reflex responses, the mechanical parameters can be determined accurately and efficiently using computer programs. In the sample of subjects studied (nine with disability related to spinal cord injury, head injury, or stroke, and nine with no neurological disability), the inertia of the lower leg was significantly reduced in the subjects with disability (p<0.05) as a result of atrophy, but the stiffness and viscosity were within normal limits. The values of inertia were also compared with anthropometric data in the literature. The identification of these passive parameters is particularly important in designing systems for functional electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles, but the methods may be widely applicable in rehabilitation medicine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536776/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5390379","pubMedId":"8800224","volume":"4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Estimating mechanical parameters of leg segments in individuals with and without physical disabilities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating mechanical parameters of leg segments in individuals with and without physical disabilities","sourcePdf":"00536776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076293S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"88","articleId":"536776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536807,"authors":[{"name":"M.N.

By providing the cost, performance and reliability levels of monolithic integration, they offer potential advantages over multi-chip modules assembled with packaging technology. This paper studies the required process technology, as well as design, test and packaging issues, for integrating wide varieties of systems. The goal is to delineate the necessary steps in bringing Integrated Systems to market within a realistic period. With monolithic integration as the ultimate aim, a multi-chip entry point is identified that can start system technology on a learning curve of cost reduction using the same scaling principles that drive integrated circuits. Three challenges to be surmounted are identified in streamlining the I/O's and progressing along a learning curve, namely I/O scaling, I/O loading, and full-functional test. The \"composite IC\" is the entry point. A large chip, containing only global interconnects and power distribution, acts as a silicon backplane. Subsystem-chips, such as digital microprocessors or sensors, are flip-chip mounted using the accuracy of MEMS processing to fabricate \"snap-together\" physical and electrical interfaces with high reproducibility. While similar to conventional MCM's, this chip-to-chip connection has few compromises over on-chip connections. By keeping the fabrication responsibility within one organization, just as in monolithic chips, there is no need for incoming inspection. Added ESD protection and test-head loading are avoided on interior nodes by a new intra-factory method of testing.","doi":"10.1109/16.536814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/11487/00536814.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.536814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11487","startPage":"1678","endPage":"1687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Systems [systems on a chip]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Systems [systems on a chip]","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395328","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Systems [systems on a chip]","sourcePdf":"00536814.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029857S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"8","articleId":"536814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":536815,"authors":[{"name":"V.P.

The Neuron MOS transistor is a recently discovered device principle which has a number of input gates that couple capacitively to a floating gate. The floating gate potential controls the current of a transistor channel. This device can be used in logic circuits. A threshold current through the Neuron MOS transistor can be defined that causes a switching of the output of the logic circuits as soon as the channel current surmounts or falls below the specified value. We designed two different multiplier cells, one based on a Neuron MOS inverter, and the other on a Neuron MOS n-MOSFET which is used as one input device of a comparator circuit. Functionality of both cells is proven for data rates up to 50 MHz which represents the first high-speed measurement of a circuit based on this new design principle. A perspective for the upper speed limit found at more than 500 MHz is given by simulation. The new design principle has a layout area reduced by more than a factor of two compared to usual multiplier cells. Moreover, it is shown, that depending on the design chosen, high speed operation leads to considerable power savings. In view of those advantages it is concluded that the principle of threshold logic qualifies for a major breakthrough for packing density improvement of CMOS-based applications.","doi":"10.1109/16.536816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/11487/00536816.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.536816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11487","startPage":"1700","endPage":"1708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the application of the Neuron MOS transistor principle for modern VLSI design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the application of the Neuron MOS transistor principle for modern VLSI design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536816/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395330","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the application of the Neuron MOS transistor principle for modern VLSI design","sourcePdf":"00536816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131602S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"32","articleId":"536816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536818,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

In the case of low voltage (<100 V) power rectifiers, the silicon P-i-N rectifier has been displaced by the silicon Schottky rectifier, and it is projected that the silicon TMBS rectifier will be the preferred choice in the future. In the case of high voltage (>100 V) power rectifiers, the silicon P-i-N rectifier continues to dominate but significant improvements are expected by the introduction of the silicon MPS rectifier followed by the GaAs and SiC based Schottky rectifiers. Equally important developments are occurring in power switch technology. The silicon bipolar power transistor has been displaced by silicon power MOSFETs in low voltage (<100 V) systems and by the silicon IGBTs in high voltage (>100 V) systems. The process technology for these MOS-gated devices has shifted from V-MOS in the early 1970s to DMOS in the 1980s, with more recent introduction of the UMOS technology in the 1990s. For the very high power systems, the thyristor and GTO continue to dominate, but significant effort is underway to develop MOS-gated thyristors (MCTs, ESTs, DG-BRTs) to replace them before the turn of the century. Beyond that time frame, it is projected that silicon carbide based switches will begin to displace these silicon devices.","doi":"10.1109/16.536818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/11487/00536818.pdf","startPage":"1717","endPage":"1731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.536818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trends in power semiconductor devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536818/","displayDocTitle":"Trends in power semiconductor devices","volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395332","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trends in power semiconductor devices","sourcePdf":"00536818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058995S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"296","articleId":"536818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":536819,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

Current laboratory systems are capable of transcribing continuous speech from any speaker with average word-error rates between 5% and 10%. If speaker adaptation is allowed, then after 2 or 3 minutes of speech, the error rate will drop well below 5% for most speakers. LVR systems had been limited to dictation applications since the systems were speaker dependent and required words to be spoken with a short pause between them. However, the capability to recognize natural continuous-speech input from any speaker opens up many more applications. As a result, LVR technology appears to be on the brink of widespread deployment across a range of information technology (IT) systems. This article discusses the principles and architecture of current LVR systems and identifies the key issues affecting their future deployment. To illustrate the various points raised, the Cambridge University HTK system is described. This system is a modem design that gives state-of-the-art performance, and it is typical of the current generation of recognition systems.

This is known as the \"mismatched condition.\" Studies have shown [l] that most contemporary systems achieve good recognition performance if the conditions during training are similar to those during operation (matched conditions). Frequently, mismatched conditions axe present in which the performance is dramatically degraded as compared to the ideal matched conditions. A common example of this mismatch is when training is done on clean speech and testing is performed on noise- or channel-corrupted speech. Robust speech techniques [2] attempt to maintain the performance of a speech processing system under such diverse conditions of operation. This article presents an overview of current speaker-recognition systems and the problems encountered in operation, and it focuses on the front-end feature extraction process of robust speech techniques as a method of improvement. Linear predictive (LP) analysis, the first step of feature extraction, is discussed, and various robust cepstral features derived from LP coefficients are described. Also described is the afJine transform, which is a feature transformation approach that integrates mismatch to simultaneously combat both channel and noise distortion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536825/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","volume":"13","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"5389832","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust speaker recognition: a feature-based approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust speaker recognition: a feature-based approach","sourcePdf":"00536825.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0605S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"213","articleId":"536825","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":536856,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The magnetic forces act to push the arc off the contacts into an arc chute, which consists of a number of metal plates. The arc chute causes the arc to be split into a number of smaller arcs, thereby facilitating the process of extinguishing the arc. In the last 20 years, the technology of circuit breakers has dramatically advanced, now including mature devices based on gas-blast (such as SF/sub 6/) and vacuum interruption. At the same time, the technology of power electronic devices has evolved rapidly, leading to suggestions of a purely static circuit breaker based on solid-state electronic devices. Recently, several different proposals have appeared for current-limiting devices to be used in conjunction with or in replacement of conventional circuit breakers. The technologies involved in these proposals have ranged from very familiar (series reactors) to quite innovative (conductive polymer devices). Several of these proposed technologies have been used to a limited extent in commercial products, but they are very likely to see increasing applications as the technology matures. This paper begins with a short review of conventional circuit breaker action for background, then reviews the recent literature for current-limiting technologies that could be applied to low-voltage electric power systems. The paper concludes with a description of work underway for further development of conductive polymer current limiters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395398","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"32","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"Review of technologies for current-limiting low-voltage circuit breakers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review of technologies for current-limiting low-voltage circuit breakers","sourcePdf":"00536858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035221S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1996","isNumber":"11488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"48","articleId":"536858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536867,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The eradication of such sensors has been the subject of many publications. This paper describes the principles and implementation of a new algorithm for combined flux-linkage and position estimation in permanent magnet motors. The algorithm uses the machine's flux-linkage versus current versus position characteristic and is thus able to take account of machine nonlinearities. The position estimator utilizes the characteristic in a generalized nonintrusive estimation scheme, which is effective over the whole range of operating conditions. The paper shows implementation of the estimator as embedded code in a digital signal processor-based drive system. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm under steady-state and transient conditions, when the drive is operating closed loop sensorless, i.e., with the rotor position being provided by the position estimator.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.536870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11488","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1097","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/11488/00536870.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of permanent magnet motor drives using a new position estimation technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1996","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Control of permanent magnet motor drives using a new position estimation technique","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395410","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of permanent magnet motor drives using a new position estimation technique","sourcePdf":"00536870.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066104S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1996","isNumber":"11488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"65","articleId":"536870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":536873,"authors":[{"name":"V.

A square wave is added to each of the phase voltage commands in the pulse dropping region. Addition of the square wave maintains the fundamental component gain of the PWM in the pulse dropping region and extends the PWM linearity all the way to the six-step mode of operation. The method eliminates the need to overmodulate the phase voltage commands to extend linearity, resulting in increased dynamic range for the associated control. The magnitude of the square wave is governed by a function of the modulation index. Analytical expressions are derived for the required function. A simple approximation of this function is suggested and its effectiveness demonstrated for actual implementation.

Each encoder and decoder includes a set of CMACs having different widths of generalization region. A CMAC with a wider generalization region is used to learn a lower frequency component of the original image. The training signals for each CMAC are progressively transmitted to a decoder. Compression is achieved by decreasing the number of training signals for CMAC with a wider generalization region, and by making quantization intervals wider for CMAC with a smaller generalization region. CMACs in the decoder are trained on the training signals to be transmitted. The output is recursively added to the other so that the quality of image reconstruction is gradually improved. The proposed method, unlike the conventional hierarchical coding methods, uses no filtering technique in both decimation and interpolation processes, and has the following advantages: (i) it does not suffer from problems of blocking effect; (ii) the computation includes no multiplication; (iii) the coarsest reconstructed image is quickly produced; (iv) the total number of transmitted data is equal to the number of the original image pixels; (v) all the reconstructed images are equal to the original image in size; (vi) quantization errors introduced at one level can be taken into account at the next level, allowing lossless progressive image transmission.","doi":"10.1109/83.536888","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1401","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/11519/00536888.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.536888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical image coding via cerebellar model arithmetic computers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Digital arithmetic","Decoding","Image reconstruction","Image communication","Quantization","Frequency","Filtering","Interpolation","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","visual communication","image reconstruction","quantisation (signal)","cerebellar model arithmetic computers","decoding","learning (artificial intelligence)","interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical image coding","cerebellar model arithmetic computers","progressive image transmission","learning capability","CMAC","cerebellar model articulation controller","encoder","decoder","generalization region","frequency component","training signals","compression","quantization intervals","image reconstruction","decimation","interpolation","blocking effect","quantization errors","lossless progressive image transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical image coding via cerebellar model arithmetic computers","volume":"5","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5397020","pubMedId":"18290057","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical image coding via cerebellar model arithmetic computers","sourcePdf":"00536888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03548S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"33","articleId":"536888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":536890,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Chang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Agricultural Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Young-Chang Chang","id":"37087761743"},{"name":"J.F.

The calibration scheme concentrated on comprehensively estimating and removing the RGB errors without specifying error sources and their effects. The algorithm for color calibration was based upon the use of a standardized color chart and developed as a preprocessing tool for color image analysis. According to the theory of image formation, RGB errors in color images were categorized into multiplicative and additive errors. Multiplicative and additive errors contained various error sources-gray-level shift, a variation in amplification and quantization in camera electronics or frame grabber, the change of color temperature of illumination with time, and related factors. The RGB errors of arbitrary colors in an image were estimated from the RGB errors of standard colors contained in the image. The color calibration method also contained an algorithm for correcting the nonuniformity of illumination in the scene. The algorithm was tested under two different conditions-uniform and nonuniform illumination in the scene. The RGB errors of arbitrary colors in test images were almost completely removed after color calibration. The maximum residual error was seven gray levels under uniform illumination and 12 gray levels under nonuniform illumination. Most residual RGB errors were caused by residual nonuniformity of illumination in images, The test results showed that the developed method was effective in correcting the variations in RGB color values caused by vision system components.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/11519/00536890.pdf","startPage":"1414","endPage":"1422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.536890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.536890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RGB calibration for color image analysis in machine vision","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Image analysis","Image color analysis","Machine vision","Lighting","System testing","Additives","Layout","Algorithm design and analysis","Quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","computer vision","image colour analysis","error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RGB calibration","color image analysis","machine vision","color calibration method","RGB color values","vision system components","algorithm","standardized color chart","preprocessing tool","additive errors","multiplicative errors","error sources","gray-level shift","color temperature","error estimation","illumination nonuniformity","maximum residual error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","displayDocTitle":"RGB calibration for color image analysis in machine vision","volume":"5","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5397022","pubMedId":"18290059","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RGB calibration for color image analysis in machine vision","sourcePdf":"00536890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04386S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"77","articleId":"536890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":536891,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wen-Rong Wu","id":"37087156588"},{"name":"Shieh-Chung Wei","affiliation":["Southen Information System, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shieh-Chung Wei","id":"37087759494"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"536891","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":251},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotation and gray-scale transform-invariant texture classification using spiral resampling, subband decomposition, and hidden Markov model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536891","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gray-scale","Spirals","Hidden Markov models","Two dimensional displays","Mirrors","Filter bank","Markov random fields","Wavelet transforms","Gabor filters","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image texture","image classification","hidden Markov models","image sampling","quadrature mirror filters","band-pass filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gray-scale transform-invariant texture classification","spiral resampling","subband decomposition","hidden Markov model","rotation","2D texture images","1D signals","quadrature mirror filter bank","sampled signal decomposition","high-order autocorrelation functions","vector sequence","simulations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/83.536891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/11519/00536891.pdf","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.536891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11519","abstract":"This paper proposes a new texture classification algorithm that is invariant to rotation and gray-scale transformation.

Local shape variability is accommodated by applying a vector-field transformation to the underlying material coordinate system of the template while constraining the transformation to be smooth (globally positive definite Jacobian). Smoothness is guaranteed without specifically penalizing large-magnitude deformations of small subvolumes by constraining the transformation on the basis of a Stokesian limit of the fluid-dynamical Navier-Stokes equations. This differs fundamentally from quadratic penalty methods, such as those based on linearized elasticity or thin-plate splines, in that stress restraining the motion relaxes over time allowing large-magnitude deformations. Kinematic nonlinearities are inherently necessary to maintain continuity of structures during large-magnitude deformations, and are included in all results. After initial global registration, final mappings are obtained by numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations associated with the constrained optimization problem. Automatic regridding is performed by propagating templates as the nonlinear transformations evaluated on a finite lattice become singular. Application of the method to intersubject registration of neuroanatomical structures illustrates the ability to account for local anatomical variability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deformable templates using large deformation kinematics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.536892","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/11519/00536892.pdf","startPage":"1435","endPage":"1447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.536892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Deformable templates using large deformation kinematics","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5397024","pubMedId":"18290061","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deformable templates using large deformation kinematics","sourcePdf":"00536892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052097S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"744","articleId":"536892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":536897,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A detailed comparison of the proposed method and the commonly used transfer function method reveals that the proposed approach is simple and potentially more powerful.","doi":"10.1109/26.536913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11489/00536913.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.536913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of renewal theory in the analysis of ARQ protocols","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"On the use of renewal theory in the analysis of ARQ protocols","volume":"44","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5395434","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536913/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of renewal theory in the analysis of ARQ protocols","sourcePdf":"00536913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025062S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"85","articleId":"536913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":536914,"authors":[{"name":"K.B.

A concatenated receiver for such a system consists of a chain of independently working estimators ended with an outer detector. Each stage of the receiver chain corresponds to a certain code in the system. Maximum likelihood sequence detection with a concatenated receiver requires soft information consisting of symbol aposteriori probabilities to be transferred between the receiver stages. In this paper the optimal inner estimator is derived and further simplified into a new asymptotically optimal one by imposing a tree structure on the inner code. By mapping several suboptimal inner estimators onto the tree structure and noting which approximations they make, a theoretical performance ranking is obtained. The asymptotical performance of the optimal concatenated detector at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is investigated. The decision variables underlying the pairwise error event probability are shown to be asymptotically Gaussian and consequently a free Euclidean distance can be found for the optimal concatenated detector.","doi":"10.1109/26.536915","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11489/00536915.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.536915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"1086","endPage":"1095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft information transfer for sequence detection with concatenated receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Soft information transfer for sequence detection with concatenated receivers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536915/","volume":"44","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395436","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft information transfer for sequence detection with concatenated receivers","sourcePdf":"00536915.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054792S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","articleId":"536915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":536917,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.

Starting from an error probability criterion, we first derive a near-optimum receiver for this channel that admits a detector-estimator decomposition, has certain asymptotic optimality properties and a complexity which is independent of the length of the observation interval. The performance of this detector is analytically characterized and contrasted with that of the optimal multiuser detector for the time-invariant (or static) CDMA Rayleigh-fading channel when it is implemented over the time-varying channel. Notable among our conclusions is the fact that, unlike the static channel multiuser detector, the time-varying channel detector is able to withstand not only the estimated interference from the other system users, but also, the residual interference (that cannot be estimated) arising out of imperfect estimation of the interferer fading parameters. Using estimation error covariance information, this detector shows flexibility in accommodating a wide range of interferer fading conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving near-optimum asymptotic efficiency and fading resistance over the time-varying Rayleigh-faded CDMA channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.536919","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11489/00536919.pdf","startPage":"1130","endPage":"1143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.536919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536919/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Achieving near-optimum asymptotic efficiency and fading resistance over the time-varying Rayleigh-faded CDMA channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395440","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving near-optimum asymptotic efficiency and fading resistance over the time-varying Rayleigh-faded CDMA channel","sourcePdf":"00536919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035714S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","articleId":"536919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":536920,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The structure of the CD3-OFDM demodulator is described, based on a new channel estimation loop exploiting the error correction capability of a forward error correction (FEC) decoder and frequency and time domain filtering to mitigate the effects of noise and residual errors. In contrast to the conventional coherent OFDM demodulation schemes, CD3-OFDM does not require the transmission of a comb of pilot tones for channel estimation and equalization, therefore yielding a significant improvement in spectrum efficiency (typically between 5-15%). The performance of the system with QPSK modulation is analyzed by computer simulations, on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and frequency selective channels, under static and mobile reception conditions. For convolutional coding rate 1/2, the results indicate that CD3-OFDM allows one to achieve a very fast adaptation to the channel characteristics in a mobile environment (maximum tolerable Doppler shift of about 80 Hz for an OFDM symbol duration of 1 ms, as differential demodulation) and an E/sub b//N/sub 0/ performance similar to coherent demodulation (e.g., E/sub b//N/sub 0/=4.3 dB at bit-error rate (BER)=2/spl middot/10/sup -4/ on the AWGN channel). Therefore, CD3-OFDM can be suitable for digital sound and television broadcasting services over selective radio channels, addressed to fixed and vehicular receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","volume":"44","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395441","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"CD3-OFDM: a novel demodulation scheme for fixed and mobile receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CD3-OFDM: a novel demodulation scheme for fixed and mobile receivers","sourcePdf":"00536920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035242S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"162","articleId":"536920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":536921,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

It is shown that for increasing levels of diversity the soft-limiter becomes quite effective, resulting in a receiver performance that approaches a maximum likelihood (ML) soft decision receiver with perfect jammer state information.","doi":"10.1109/26.536922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11489/00536922.pdf","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.536922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-limiter RAKE receivers for coded DS/DPSK systems over pulse jammed multipath-fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536922/","displayDocTitle":"Soft-limiter RAKE receivers for coded DS/DPSK systems over pulse jammed multipath-fading channels","volume":"44","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395443","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-limiter RAKE receivers for coded DS/DPSK systems over pulse jammed multipath-fading channels","sourcePdf":"00536922.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03446S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","articleId":"536922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":536923,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

The most commonly used analysis tools for code acquisition, namely the direct and the flow-graph approaches, are extended to the MAX/TC criterion. An accurate but simple approximation to the acquisition time probability density function is found in terms of a gamma distribution, which is shown to yield much better accuracy than the Gaussian distribution.

The second set of approaches are integrated approaches that perform both the equalization and decoding operations together.

The asymptotic efficiency of this receiver relative to an uncoded coherent binary phase shift keying (BPSK) receiver (termed asymptotic multiuser coding gain, or AMCG) is used as a performance criterion throughout. Also, computer simulations are used whenever the computation of the AMCG is not feasible. It is shown that a number of the approaches which are introduced achieve a high performance level with a moderate complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Multiaccess communication","Decoding","Multiuser detection","Feedback","Binary phase shift keying","Performance gain","Computer simulation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","radio receivers","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","radiofrequency interference","decision feedback equalisers","phase shift keying","estimation theory","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutionally coded asynchronous DS-CDMA","suboptimum multiuser receivers","receiver performance","multiuser interference","near-far problem","optimal receiver","partitioned approaches","multiuser interference equalization","decoding","integrated approaches","decision feedback equalizer","linear equalizer","trellis/tree-based approach","asymptotic efficiency","uncoded coherent binary phase shift keying","BPSK receiver","asymptotic multiuser coding gain","computer simulations","sequence estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536924","doi":"10.1109/26.536924","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11489/00536924.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.536924","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suboptimum multiuser receivers for convolutionally coded asynchronous DS-CDMA systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Suboptimum multiuser receivers for convolutionally coded asynchronous DS-CDMA systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536924/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","volume":"44","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395445","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suboptimum multiuser receivers for convolutionally coded asynchronous DS-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00536924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086712S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"82","articleId":"536924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":536927,"authors":[{"name":"F.I.

Our objective is to design efficient coding/decoding schemes for the transmission of the CELP line spectral parameters (LSPs) over very noisy channels. We begin by quantifying the amount of \"residual redundancy\" inherent in the LSPs of Federal Standard 1016 CELP. This is done by modeling the LSPs as first- and second-order Markov chains. Two models for LSP generation are proposed; the first model characterizes the intraframe correlation exhibited by the LSPs, while the second model captures both intraframe and interframe correlation. By comparing the entropy rates of the models thus constructed with the CELP rates, it is shown that as many as one-third of the LSP bits in every frame of speech are redundant. We next consider methods by which this residual redundancy can be exploited by an appropriately designed channel decoder. Before transmission, the LSPs are encoded with a forward error control (FEC) code; we consider both block (Reed-Solomon) codes and convolutional codes. Soft-decision decoders that exploit the residual redundancy in the LSPs are implemented assuming additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and independent Rayleigh fading environments. Simulation results employing binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) indicate coding gains of 2-5 dB over soft-decision decoders that do not exploit the residual redundancy.","doi":"10.1109/89.536927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/11518/00536927.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.536927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel codes that exploit the residual redundancy in CELP-encoded speech","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536927/","displayDocTitle":"Channel codes that exploit the residual redundancy in CELP-encoded speech","volume":"4","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5397455","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel codes that exploit the residual redundancy in CELP-encoded speech","sourcePdf":"00536927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034559S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"106","articleId":"536927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536928,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

We have developed a novel speaker-dependent lipreading system that uses hidden Markov models. An audiovisual system known as Lipreading to Enhance Automatic Perception of Speech (LEAPS) is described, in which the lipreading system is used in conjunction with an audio ASR system in order to improve the accuracy of the latter, especially under degraded acoustical conditions.

It focuses on the parallel model combination (PMC) scheme, which has been shown to be a powerful technique for achieving noise robustness. Most experiments reported on PMC to date have been on small, 10-50 word vocabulary systems. Experiments on the Resource Management (RM) database, a 1000 word continuous speech recognition task, reveal compensation requirements not highlighted by the smaller vocabulary tasks. In particular, that it is necessary to compensate the dynamic parameters as well as the static parameters to achieve good recognition performance. The database used for these experiments was the RM speaker independent task with either Lynx Helicopter noise or Operation Room noise from the NOISEX-92 database added. The experiments reported here used the HTK RM recognizer developed at CUED modified to include PMC based compensation for the static, delta and delta-delta parameters. After training on clean speech data, the performance of the recognizer was found to be severely degraded when noise was added to the speech signal at between 10 and 18 dB. However, using PMC the performance was restored to a level comparable with that obtained when training directly in the noise corrupted environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5397457","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Robust continuous speech recognition using parallel model combination","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust continuous speech recognition using parallel model combination","sourcePdf":"00536929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05043S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"267","articleId":"536929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536930,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By combining a numerical solution for the EDFA and an analytical expression for FWM components generated through the cascade, the model allows a realistic system analysis which includes gain peaking effect, amplified spontaneous emission accumulation and the effect of dispersion management on the four-wave mixing efficiency. The FWM power distribution at the end of the multi-amplifier transmission link is computed taking into account the phase relation between FWM light amplitudes generated within different sections of the link. The transmission of many WDM channels, evenly spaced around 1547.5 nm, has been analyzed for various dispersion management techniques and propagation distances. Numerical results point out the importance of such a model for a realistic design of WDM optical communication systems and networks. A proper choice of chromatic dispersion, amplifier characteristics, span length, input signal powers and wavelengths, combined with the use of gain equalizing filters, allows to maximize the transmission distance ensuring acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and limited SNR variation among channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536960/","volume":"14","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"5387889","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of four-wave mixing and gain peaking in amplified WDM optical communication systems and networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of four-wave mixing and gain peaking in amplified WDM optical communication systems and networks","sourcePdf":"00536960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063204S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"68","articleId":"536960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536961,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

In this paper, the induced performance degradation is quantified, both experimentally and analytically, and solution paths are identified. It is concluded that the total crosstalk level of noise generating parasitics in a generalized optical network must be held below -25 dB for a penalty of less than 1 dB-a further 2 to 4 dB may lead to network failure; otherwise, means of suppressing the noise by RF rejection at the receiver must be invoked.

Optical orthogonal codes (OOC's) are employed as signature sequences, and parallel optic-fiber delay line encoders and correlators are adopted in the transmitters and the receivers, respectively. The upper bound on the bit error probability of PPM/CDMA is derived under the condition that the receiver slot timing shifts from the transmitter timing clock. The bit error probability performance is evaluated for some values of the number of slots per frame, average signal photocount, and the number of simultaneous users. It is shown that as the number of slots per frame increases, the timing offset should be restricted to be smaller to achieve low bit error probability. Further, when the timing offset is small, the improvement of the bit error probability performance with the increase of the number of slots per frame under the photocount per second constraint is shown to be larger than that under the photocount per symbol constraint.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication systems with PPM signaling","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.536963","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/11497/00536963.pdf","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.536963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=536963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536963/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"Communication systems with PPM signaling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5387892","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication systems with PPM signaling","sourcePdf":"00536963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028915S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","articleId":"536963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":536965,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This switch can easily handle multicast switching because it is based on a broadcast-and-select network. Compared to an alternative switch that uses a cell-interleave time-division multiplexing scheme, the proposed optical switch has a much simpler structure. It does not need a cell compressor at each input and a cell expander at each output, which greatly reduces hardware complexity. Feasibility analyzes showed that a 64/spl times/64 photonic ATM switch with 2.5 Gb/s input/output is possible using the proposed technology. In an experimental demonstration, 4 b cells were selected from a 55 Gb/s bit-interleave multiplexed cell stream by using a new nonlinear optical fiber switch. With its high switch throughput, our switch is a strong candidate for future large-capacity optical switching nodes.","doi":"10.1109/50.536965","startPage":"1979","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/11497/00536965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.536965","endPage":"1985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ultrafast photonic ATM switch based on bit-interleave multiplexing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536965/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","displayDocTitle":"An ultrafast photonic ATM switch based on bit-interleave multiplexing","volume":"14","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5387894","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ultrafast photonic ATM switch based on bit-interleave multiplexing","sourcePdf":"00536965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061876S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"16","articleId":"536965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":536966,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The high index layer on the polished fiber endface and the index matching material, which are important connector parameters, are investigated by measuring the return loss from one perpendicular fiber endface coated with the material and by etching the fiber endface. It is useful to apply two materials with different refractive indices to derive the refractive index and thickness of high index layers on perpendicular fiber endfaces. The index matching material we use has a refractive index of 1.467 at 20/spl deg/C and a thermal coefficient of -2.9/spl times/10/sup -4///spl deg/C at 1.3 /spl mu/m. We performed return loss calculations and experiments of the four contact type connectors.

A consequent increase in the number of on-chip faults as well as the growing importance of quality-metrics such as reliability and fault-tolerance are making on-chip fault-tolerance mandatory. On-chip realization of a computation is fault-secure if an observable error in the computation is detected. Components used in life-critical systems should be secured against all faults. While fault-security can be realized by duplicating the computation on disjoint hardware and voting on the result(s), such straightforward strategies entail appreciable hardware overhead. This paper presents computer-aided behavioral synthesis of fault-secure microarchitectures which require less than proportional increase in hardware. The strategy selects intermediate computations for additional voting. The resulting class of fault-secure microarchitectures supplants the enormous hardware requirements of naive fault-secure strategies with enhanced hardware utilization afforded by securing the intermediate computations. Experimental results show that fault-security can be implemented at a less than proportional increase in hardware overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/536993/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","volume":"45","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5401801","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Time-constrained scheduling during high-level synthesis of fault-secure VLSI digital signal processors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-constrained scheduling during high-level synthesis of fault-secure VLSI digital signal processors","sourcePdf":"00536993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022533S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"21","articleId":"536993","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":536994,"authors":[{"name":"Y.G.

A formalism is introduced to represent the FTAM by a set of assertions. This formalism enables an execution tree to be generated, where each path from the root to a leaf of the tree is a well-defined formula. The set of well-defined formulas constitutes a useful framework that fully characterizes the test sequence. The input patterns of the test sequence (fault and activation domains) then are determined to fewer specific structural criteria over the execution tree (activation of proper sets of paths). This provides a framework for generating a functional deterministic test for programs that implement complex FTAM. This methodology has been used to extend a debugging tool aimed at testing fault tolerance protocols developed by BULL France. It has been applied successfully to the injection of faults in the inter-replica protocol that supports the application-level fault-tolerance features of the architecture of the ESPRIT-funded Delta-4 project. The results of these experiments are analyzed in detail. In particular, even though the target protocol had been independently verified formally, the application of the proposed testing strategy revealed two fault-tolerance deficiency faults.","doi":"10.1109/24.537015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.537015","endPage":"455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/11550/00537015.pdf","startPage":"443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault injection for formal testing of fault tolerance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537015/","displayDocTitle":"Fault injection for formal testing of fault tolerance","volume":"45","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"5401808","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault injection for formal testing of fault tolerance","sourcePdf":"00537015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02997S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"22","articleId":"537015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":537016,"authors":[{"name":"T.M.

The goal is to predict the number of faults. Ten software product measures were gathered from a large commercial software system. Principal components were then extracted from these measures. We trained two neural networks, one with the observed (raw) data, and one with principal components. We compare the predictive quality of the two competing models using data collected from two similar systems. These systems were developed by the same organization, and used the same development process. For the environment we studied, applying principal-components analysis to the raw data yields a neural-network model whose predictive quality is statistically better than a neural-network model developed using the raw data alone. The improvement in model predictive quality is appreciable from a practitioner's point of view. We concur with published literature regarding the number of hidden layers needed in a neural-network model. A single hidden layer of neurons yielded a network of sufficient generality to be useful when predicting faults. This is important, because networks with more hidden layers take correspondingly more time to train. The application of alternative network architectures and training algorithms in software engineering should continue to be investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5401809","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using neural networks to predict software faults during testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using neural networks to predict software faults during testing","sourcePdf":"00537016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051448S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"15","articleId":"537016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":537030,"authors":[{"name":"B.H.

Because biosignals recorded on the body surface reflect the internal behaviour and status of the organism or its parts, they are ideally suited to provide essential information of these organs to the clinician without any invasive measures. But how are the recorded time courses of the signals to be interpreted with regard to a diagnostic decision? What are the essential features and in what code is the information hidden in the signals? These questions are typical of so-called pattern-recognition tasks. This article reviews pattern recognition as it applies to medical diagnostics and discusses the concept of wavelet networks as a means of biosignal classification. An example is presented in which this approach was used for classifying preprocessed ECG signals to identify patients who were at high-risk of developing ventricular tachycardia (VT).","doi":"10.1109/51.537066","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/11553/00537066.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"111","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.537066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classifying biosignals with wavelet networks [a method for noninvasive diagnosis]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Classifying biosignals with wavelet networks [a method for noninvasive diagnosis]","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5400995","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classifying biosignals with wavelet networks [a method for noninvasive diagnosis]","sourcePdf":"00537066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054699S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1996","isNumber":"11553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"84","articleId":"537066","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":537089,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It converts complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional data into simple geometric relationships on a low-dimensional display. As it thereby compresses information while preserving the most important topological and metric relationships of the primary data elements on the display, it may also be thought to produce some kind of abstractions. The term self-organizing map signifies a class of mappings defined by error-theoretic considerations. In practice they result in certain unsupervised, competitive learning processes, computed by simple-looking SOM algorithms. Many industries have found the SOM-based software tools useful. The most important property of the SOM, orderliness of the input-output mapping, can be utilized for many tasks: reduction of the amount of training data, speeding up learning nonlinear interpolation and extrapolation, generalization, and effective compression of information for its transmission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"84","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5403772","displayDocTitle":"Engineering applications of the self-organizing map","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Engineering applications of the self-organizing map","sourcePdf":"00537105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11735S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"541","articleId":"537105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":537107,"authors":[{"name":"G.V.

The results we have reported to date, however, have been based exclusively upon simulation studies. In this paper, we establish that dynamic gradient training methods can be successfully used for synthesizing neural network controllers directly on instances of real systems. In particular we describe the application of dynamic gradient methods for training a time-lagged recurrent neural network feedback controller for the problem of engine idle speed control on an actual vehicle, discuss hardware and software issues, and provide representative experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/5.537107","startPage":"1407","endPage":"1420","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/11562/00537107.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.537107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic neural network methods applied to on-vehicle idle speed control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Vehicle dynamics","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Nonlinear systems","Automotive engineering","Control system synthesis","Network synthesis","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","neurocontrollers","nonlinear dynamical systems","internal combustion engines","velocity control","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic neural network","vehicle idle speed control","dynamic gradient methods","nonlinear dynamical systems","neurocontrol","time-lagged recurrent neural network","feedback control","automotive engine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537107/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic neural network methods applied to on-vehicle idle speed control","volume":"84","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5403774","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic neural network methods applied to on-vehicle idle speed control","sourcePdf":"00537107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056446S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"56","articleId":"537107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":537108,"authors":[{"name":"B.E.

We specifically address the difficult problem of localizing multiple targets using only passive sensors, i.e. the sensors detect only bearing angles. Thus, target positions must be found through triangulation. An efficient solution to this problem has been of particular interest in air defence applications. In this paper, we describe two different neural network based approaches for solving this passive tracking problem. In particular, we demonstrate the use of a Hopfield neural network to preface the subsequent development of the multiple elastic modules (MEM) model. The MEM model is presented as a significant extension to current self-organizing neural networks. We describe the unique features of the MEM model, including nonhomogeneous adaptive temperature field for escaping from poor local optima, and locking and expectation features used for dealing with dynamic real-world problems. Applications of the MEM model to other areas including computer vision, are also briefly described.","doi":"10.1109/5.537110","startPage":"1442","endPage":"1457","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.537110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11562","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/11562/00537110.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network optimization for multi-target multi-sensor passive tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537110/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network optimization for multi-target multi-sensor passive tracking","volume":"84","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5403777","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network optimization for multi-target multi-sensor passive tracking","sourcePdf":"00537110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042076S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"25","articleId":"537110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":537111,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Qian","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Qian","id":"37086997460"},{"name":"L.P.

The objective is to restore image degradation due to photon scattering and collimator photon penetration with the gamma camera and allow improved quantitative external measurements of radionuclides in vivo. The specific clinical model proposed is the imaging of bremsstrahlung radiation using /sup 32/P and /sup 90/Y. The theoretical basis for four-channel multiresolution wavelet decomposition of the nuclear image into different subimages is developed with the objective of isolating the signal from noise. A fuzzy rule is generated to train a membership function using least mean squares to obtain an optimal balance between image restoration and the stability of the neural network, while maintaining a linear response for the camera to radioactivity dose. A multichannel modified Hopfield neural network architecture is then proposed for multichannel image restoration using the dominant signal subimages.","doi":"10.1109/5.537111","startPage":"1458","endPage":"1473","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/11562/00537111.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.537111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet-based neural network with fuzzy-logic adaptivity for nuclear image restoration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Image restoration","Cameras","Nuclear medicine","Nuclear measurements","Degradation","Electromagnetic scattering","Particle scattering","Optical collimators","In vivo"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radioisotope imaging","computerised tomography","image restoration","Hopfield neural nets","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy logic","medical image processing","image resolution","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet-based neural network","fuzzy logic","nuclear image restoration","image restoration","nuclear medicine gamma camera","nuclear medicine tomographic imaging","bremsstrahlung radiation","Hopfield neural network","radioactivity dose","least mean squares"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet-based neural network with fuzzy-logic adaptivity for nuclear image restoration","volume":"84","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5403778","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet-based neural network with fuzzy-logic adaptivity for nuclear image restoration","sourcePdf":"00537111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036268S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"23","articleId":"537111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":537112,"authors":[{"name":"N.G.

Our algorithm uses an adaptive approach based upon the users' desired video quality Q, and achieves compression ratios of up to 500:1 for moving gray-scale images, based on a combination of motion detection, compression, and temporal subsampling of frames. This leads to a compression ratio of over 1000:1 for full-color video sequences with the addition of the standard 4:1:1 spatial subsampling ratios in the chrominance images. The signal-to-noise ratio ranges from 29 dB to over 34 dB. Compression is performed using a combination of motion detection, neural networks, and temporal subsampling of frames. A set of neural networks is used to adaptively select the desired compression of each picture block as a function of the reconstruction quality. The motion detection process separates out regions of the frame which need to be retransmitted. Temporal subsampling of frames, along with reconstruction techniques, lead to the high compression ratios.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/11562/00537116.pdf","startPage":"1529","endPage":"1543","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.537116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.537116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low bit-rate video compression with neural networks and temporal subsampling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video compression","Neural networks","Image coding","Motion detection","Mathematical model","Image reconstruction","Standards development","Gray-scale","Video sequences","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image reconstruction","motion estimation","image sequences","feedforward neural nets","recurrent neural nets","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low bit-rate video compression","data compression","recurrent neural networks","temporal subsampling","point-process","gray-scale moving images","motion detection","full-color video sequences","chrominance images","image reconstruction","feedforward networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Low bit-rate video compression with neural networks and temporal subsampling","volume":"84","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5403783","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low bit-rate video compression with neural networks and temporal subsampling","sourcePdf":"00537116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050696S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"62","articleId":"537116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":537117,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Xu","affiliation":["The Informatics Group Computer Science and Mathematics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"lastName":"Ying Xu","id":"37087221911"},{"name":"R.J.

We describe a gene localization and modeling system, called GRAIL. GRAIL is a multiple sensor-neural network-based system. It localizes genes in anonymous DNA sequence by recognizing features related to protein-coding regions and the boundaries of coding regions, and then combines the recognized features using a neural network system. Localized coding regions are then \"optimally\" parsed into a gene model. Through years of extensive testing GRAIL consistently achieves about 90% of coding portions of test genes with a false positive rate of about 10% A number of genes for major genetic diseases have been located through the use of GRAIL, and over 1000 research laboratories worldwide use GRAIL on regular bases for localization of genes on their newly sequenced DNA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GRAIL: a multi-agent neural network system for gene identification","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.537117","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/11562/00537117.pdf","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.537117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11562","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537117","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","displayDocTitle":"GRAIL: a multi-agent neural network system for gene identification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"84","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5403784","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GRAIL: a multi-agent neural network system for gene identification","sourcePdf":"00537117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039236S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"35","articleId":"537117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":537122,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A new design scheme has been reported for parallel implementation of the CA based SbEC/DbED and DbEC/DbED code that is analogous to the conventional R-S code. Both the encoder and decoder of this code can be efficiently implemented with an array of CA (CAA) with high throughput. The design is ideally suited for high speed memory systems built with byte organized RAM chips. Extension of the scheme to detect/correct a larger number of byte errors has also been reported. Throughput of the decoder to handle tbyte errors (t/spl les/4) can be found to be substantially better than that of a conventional R-S decoder. The proposed decoder provides a simple, modular and cost effective design that is ideally suited for VLSI implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5401852","volume":"45","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CAA decoder for cellular automata based byte error correcting code","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CAA decoder for cellular automata based byte error correcting code","sourcePdf":"00537123.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0333S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"21","articleId":"537123","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":537127,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Zhang","affiliation":["AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., Kirkland, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Ming Zhang","id":"37351153000"},{"name":"S.

We propose a dynamic prioritized conflict resolution algorithm in which, when a collision occurs, all colliding messages are retransmitted according to their priority. When a new message arrives, it is allowed to participate in the algorithm as soon as it finds its priority is higher than that of some broadcast message. Using a time-slotted model, for any arrival pattern and priority distribution, we show that our algorithm runs in expected linear time, i.e., O(r), where r is the total number of message transmitted. We also show that the expected waiting time for any message x is O(rank(x)+log s), where rank(x) is the expected number of messages with higher priority which transmit while x is waiting, and s is the minimum of the total number of messages participating in the algorithm and the total number of nodes in the network. The analysis presented in this work also includes an improved analysis of our original (static) prioritized conflict resolution algorithm. This work is applicable to multimedia communications where different priority values could be assigned to different kinds of traffic, and our algorithm ensures that the high-priority real-time traffic has the minimum delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","volume":"45","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5401861","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic prioritized conflict resolution on multiple access broadcast networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic prioritized conflict resolution on multiple access broadcast networks","sourcePdf":"00537132.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047876S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"2","articleId":"537132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":537144,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This architecture has been designed to take advantage of temporal communication locality. This can be done by establishing a circuit between nodes that are going to communicate frequently. Messages using those circuits face no contention. By combining circuit switching, pre-established physical circuits and wave pipelining across channels and switches, it is possible to increase network bandwidth considerably, also reducing latency for communications that use pre-established physical circuits. This router architecture also allows to reduce the overhead of the software messaging layer in multicomputers by offering a better hardware support.

However, some blocks that have no temporal locality actually cause program execution degradation by displacing blocks that do manifest temporal behavior. In this paper, we present a simple but efficient novel hardware design called the non-temporal streaming (NTS) cache that supplements the conventional direct-mapped cache with a parallel fully associative buffer. Every cache block loaded into the main cache is monitored for temporal behavior by a hardware detection unit. Cache blocks identified as nontemporal are allocated to the buffer on subsequent requests. Our simulations show that the NTS Cache not only provides a performance improvement over the conventional direct-mapped cache, but can also save on-chip area. For some numerical programs like FFTPDE, APPSP and APPBT from the NAS benchmark suite, an integral NTS Cache of size 9 KB (i.e., 8 KB direct-mapped cache plus 1 KB NT buffer) performs as well as a 16 KB conventional direct-mapped cache.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing conflicts in direct-mapped caches with a temporality-based design","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 ICPP Workshop on Challenges for Parallel Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.1996.537156","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 ICPP Workshop on Challenges for Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3853/11246/00537156.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"163 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.1996.537156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11246","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Reducing conflicts in direct-mapped caches with a temporality-based design","conferenceDate":"12-16 Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5376079","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing conflicts in direct-mapped caches with a temporality-based design","confLoc":"Ithaca, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00537156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039755S","chronDate":"12-16 Aug 1996","isNumber":"11246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3853","citationCount":"55","articleId":"537156","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":537166,"authors":[{"name":"Jae-Dong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Kent University, Kent, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Jae-Dong Lee","id":"37350930600"},{"name":"K.E.

In today's traffic, these speed commands could be communicated to drivers, who would then have to respond to them. This raise human factors issues that need further investigation in order to assess the possible benefits. In an automated highway, speed commands cn be communicated to the vehicle's computer control system and followed directly without human errors or delays.

The switch positions of the power module are determined by the calculated stator flux and motor torque.","doi":"10.1109/PEDES.1996.537279","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Power Electronics, Drives and Energy Systems for Industrial Growth","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Power Electronics, Drives and Energy Systems for Industrial Growth","pdfPath":"/iel3/3837/11203/00537279.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDES.1996.537279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11203","startPage":"37","endPage":"43 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The next generation motor control method, DTC direct torque control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The next generation motor control method, DTC direct torque control","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Jan 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537279/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Jan. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5391070","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The next generation motor control method, DTC direct torque control","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"00537279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094921S","chronDate":"8-11 Jan 1996","isNumber":"11203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3837","citationCount":"115","articleId":"537279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":537295,"authors":[{"name":"K.G.

We used a combination of automated and supervised segmentation methods to define regions of interest based on neuroanatomical knowledge. We also used 3D surface rendering techniques to create a brain atlas that would allow us to visualize complex 3D brain structures. We further linked this Information to script files in order to preserve both spatial information and neuroanatomical knowledge. We present here the application of the atlas for visualization in surgical planning far model-driven segmentation and for the teaching of neuroanatomy. This digitized human brain has the potential to provide important reference information for the planning of surgical procedures. It can also serve as a powerful teaching tool, since spatial relationships among neuroanatomical structures can be more readily envisioned when the user is able to view and rotate the structures in 3D space. Moreover, each element of the brain atlas is associated with a name tag, displayed by a user controlled pointer. The atlas holds a major promise as a template for model-driven segmentation. Using this technique, many regions of interest can be characterized simultaneously on new brain images.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surgery","Brain modeling","Education","Humans","Data visualization","Magnetic resonance imaging","Image segmentation","Biomedical imaging","Laboratories","Neuroscience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","rendering (computer graphics)","brain models","computer aided instruction","biomedical education","medical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surgical planning","digital brain atlas","model-driven segmentation","teaching","human brain","supervised segmentation methods","neuroanatomical knowledge","brain atlas","magnetic resonance imaging","biomedical visualization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/2945.537306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel1/2945/11564/00537306.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.537306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital brain atlas for surgical planning, model-driven segmentation, and teaching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A digital brain atlas for surgical planning, model-driven segmentation, and teaching","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537306/","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5400839","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital brain atlas for surgical planning, model-driven segmentation, and teaching","sourcePdf":"00537306.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074977S","chronDate":"Sep 1996","isNumber":"11564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"171","articleId":"537306","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":537307,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The purpose of this study is to provide a strong theoretical basis for modeling and simulating dynamic recurrent neural networks. In order to achieve this, we study the effect of the statistical distribution of the weights and of the time constants on the network dynamics and we make a statistical analysis of the neural transformation. We examine the network power spectra (to draw some conclusions over the frequential behaviour of the network) and we compute the stability regions to explore the stability of the model. We show that the network is sensitive to the variations of the mean values of the weights and the time constants (because of the temporal aspects of the learned tasks). Nevertheless, our results highlight the improvements in the network dynamics due to the introduction of adaptative time constants and indicate that dynamic recurrent neural networks can bring new powerful features in the field of neural computing.","doi":"10.1109/3477.537312","pdfPath":"/iel1/3477/11566/00537312.pdf","startPage":"692","endPage":"706","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.537312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic recurrent neural networks: a dynamical analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic recurrent neural networks: a dynamical analysis","volume":"26","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5401071","pubMedId":"18263069","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic recurrent neural networks: a dynamical analysis","sourcePdf":"00537312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07011S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"39","articleId":"537312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":537314,"authors":[{"name":"L.L.E.

The results of our simulations emphasize the role of the intrinsic properties of the plant in generating movements with anthropomorphic qualities such as smoothness and unimodal velocity profiles, and demonstrate that the task of an eventual controller for the arm could be simply that of programming the amplitudes and durations of steps of neural input without considering additional motor details.

This system is able to process and learn numerical information as well as linguistic information. At first, we propose a five-layered neural network for the connectionist realization of a fuzzy inference system. The connectionist structure can house fuzzy logic rules and membership functions for fuzzy inference. We use /spl alpha/-level sets of fuzzy numbers to represent linguistic information. The inputs, outputs, and weights of the proposed network can be fuzzy numbers of any shape. Furthermore, they can be hybrid of fuzzy numbers and numerical numbers through the use of fuzzy singletons. Based on interval arithmetics, a fuzzy supervised learning algorithm is developed for the proposed system. It extends the normal supervised learning techniques to the learning problems where only linguistic teaching signals are available. The fuzzy supervised learning scheme can train the proposed system with desired fuzzy input-output pairs which are fuzzy numbers instead of the normal numerical values. With fuzzy supervised learning, the proposed system can be used for rule base concentration to reduce the number of rules in a fuzzy rule base.

The digital implementation of fuzzy control is also presented for avoiding the influence of the sampling time. Based on the results of previous fuzzy two-term controllers, a simplified fuzzy three-term controller is proposed to enhance performance.

The model is a quasi 3D one in the sense that the building walls are assumed to be much higher than the transmitter height so that the diffractions from the rooftops can be neglected. The model includes all possible specular wall and ground reflections and corner diffractions in the main street, side streets, and parallel streets of a microcell. This enables the signal propagation through all the possible paths to be tracked to the receiver at various line-of-sight (LOS) or out-of-sight (OOS) positions. Previous papers on such propagation models have included only a limited number of specular reflections and diffractions or they are restricted to a rectilinear grid where all the building walls on each side of the street are coplanar. Our model includes contributions to the received signal from all possible propagation paths, including ground and wall reflections from diffracted and specularly reflected signals both in the LOS and OOS regions. Within the scope of the UTD model, the accuracy of our model is limited mainly by the assumptions of characterizing the building walls as \"smoothed-out\" flat surfaces with average relative permittivity /spl epsiv//sub r/ and conductivity /spl sigma/. Our theoretical results of the signal path loss along the streets are compared with measurements which have been reported for city streets in Tokyo and New York City.","doi":"10.1109/8.537325","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/11567/00537325.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.537325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1317","endPage":"1326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A microcellular communications propagation model based on the uniform theory of diffraction and multiple image theory","volume":"44","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5395303","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microcellular communications propagation model based on the uniform theory of diffraction and multiple image theory","sourcePdf":"00537325.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033565S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"148","articleId":"537325","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":537326,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

To minimize the size of the total computational domain, a second-order-absorbing boundary condition (ABC) is applied upon an outer boundary of arbitrary shape which may be conformal to the surface of the scatterer. This domain is then partitioned into concentric subdomains circumscribing the object. A second-order transmission condition, derived from the ABC, is prescribed upon the interfaces between two adjacent subdomains. This particular configuration is responsible for the fast convergence of the domain decomposition iterative algorithm, which is parallelizable. Numerical results obtained with a nonparallelized computer code are presented, which emphasize the superiority of this technique in terms of memory storage requirements and computing times over the standard finite element approach, as well as over the rigorous hybrid finite element-integral equation formulation.","doi":"10.1109/8.537332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/11567/00537332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.537332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11567","startPage":"1375","endPage":"1385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast-domain decomposition method for the solution of electromagnetic scattering by large objects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast-domain decomposition method for the solution of electromagnetic scattering by large objects","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395310","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast-domain decomposition method for the solution of electromagnetic scattering by large objects","sourcePdf":"00537332.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043106S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"79","articleId":"537332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":537335,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A simple configuration based on a cross slot with unequal slot lengths on a circular patch is adopted to realize a small-size element antenna. The proposed antenna has no 90/spl deg/ hybrid coupler for circular polarization. The measured results verify the circular polarization, and the antenna radius was reduced by about 36% by using the slot lengths which are nearly equal to the diameter of the circular patch antenna.

The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects.

On the basis of the rigorous new results, the beam-forming networks of electronically-steered phased arrays can be simultaneously impedance matched to any given set of radiating elements on one side, and to any given set of mutually-coherent, phase- and amplitude-controlled microwave sources on the other. Further, the impedance match attained in transmission also holds in reception, as long as the set of mutually-coherent receivers used has the same internal impedances as the set of sources used. The impedance match attained accounts simultaneously for both the electromagnetic proximity coupling between all the radiating array elements, and for any given internal cross-coupling of the set of sources, in transmission, or of the set of receivers, in reception. The resulting impedance match is totally independent from the amplitude and phase settings of the sources, in transmission, and from the direction of the incoming beam, in reception, completely suppressing the notorious array-blindness effect for all beam directions. Further, beam-forming networks can also be designed with prescribed transmission responses-besides a prescribed impedance match-in both the transmission and reception modes, and with a number of beam-steering control components that is much smaller than the number of array elements.","doi":"10.1109/74.537363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/74/11493/00537363.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.537363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","startPage":"22","endPage":"34","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced design of phased-array beam-forming networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Advanced design of phased-array beam-forming networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537363/","volume":"38","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1996","accessionNumber":"5396786","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced design of phased-array beam-forming networks","sourcePdf":"00537363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066983S","chronDate":"Aug.  1996","isNumber":"11493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"7","articleId":"537363","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":537364,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The large number of ray-object intersection tests make ray tracing computationally intensive. Several techniques such as bounding volumes, spatial subdivision, and scene decomposition have been developed to make ray tracing more practical. Our research concentrate on image decomposition, where the pixels making up the image are decomposed to the various nodes. Each node is then responsible for a small part of the image, reducing the communication requirements. This decomposition of work is similar to the decomposition in the parallelization of other applications such as matrix multiply. But unlike these other applications, the amount of work is unknown before hand. We study the effects of network configuration, pipelining, external vs. internal bus contention, number of processors, and number of grains (sub-image region). We show that the number of grains is the most important variable in decomposition of the image, and that near linear speed-up can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 ICPP Workshop on Challenges for Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3853/11247/00537389.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"115 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 ICPP Workshop on Challenges for Parallel Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.1996.537389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.1996.537389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11247","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray tracing: parallelization via image decomposition and performance impact","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Image decomposition","Layout","Optical reflection","Computer science","Computer graphics","Computational modeling","Light sources","Testing","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","computer graphics","parallel algorithms","pipeline processing","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing","high quality graphics","light models","ray-object intersection tests","parallelization","image decomposition","performance impact","bounding volumes","spatial subdivision","scene decomposition","pixel decomposition","nodes","communication requirements","network configuration","pipelining","external bus contention","internal bus contention","processors","grains","speed-up"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Aug 1996","displayDocTitle":"Ray tracing: parallelization via image decomposition and performance impact","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5376127","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 Aug. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray tracing: parallelization via image decomposition and performance impact","confLoc":"Ithaca, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00537389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129386S","chronDate":"12-16 Aug 1996","isNumber":"11247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3853","citationCount":"1","articleId":"537389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":537394,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Kwong Kwok","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yu-Kwong Kwok","id":"37268292400"},{"name":"I.

However, designing a scheduling algorithm of low complexity without sacrificing performance remains a challenging obstacle from a practical perspective. In this paper, we present a local search-based scheduling algorithm that attempts to meet this challenge. The proposed algorithm is called Fast Assignment using Search Technique (FAST). Its overall time complexity is only O(e) where e is the number of edges in the DAG. The algorithm works by first generating an initial solution and then refining it using local neighborhood search. The algorithm outperforms numerous previous algorithms while taking dramatically smaller execution times. The distinctive feature of our research is that the performance evaluation is not carried out using simulation, rather we have tested our proposed algorithm and compared it with other algorithms using a parallel compiler with real applications on the Intel Paragon.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Parallel processing","Computer science","Algorithm design and analysis","Testing","Councils","Contracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","search problems","scheduling","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FAST","low-complexity algorithm","scheduling of DAGs","parallel processors","search-based scheduling","Fast Assignment using Search Technique","time complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537394","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.1996.537394","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 ICPP Workshop on Challenges for Parallel Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/3853/11247/00537394.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.1996.537394","startPage":"150","endPage":"157 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11247","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1996 ICPP Workshop on Challenges for Parallel Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FAST: a low-complexity algorithm for efficient scheduling of DAGs on parallel processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FAST: a low-complexity algorithm for efficient scheduling of DAGs on parallel processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Aug 1996","conferenceDate":"12-16 Aug. 1996","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5376132","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FAST: a low-complexity algorithm for efficient scheduling of DAGs on parallel processors","confLoc":"Ithaca, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00537394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092381S","chronDate":"12-16 Aug 1996","isNumber":"11247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3853","citationCount":"22","articleId":"537394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":537416,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

For example, in digital image halftoning, a gray scale version of an image needs to be approximated by a high spatial resolution binary image. Likewise, lossy image compression seeks to reconstruct an image from a minimally coded description of the original. In these and many other applications, image fidelity is determined by the human observer; hence, the effectiveness of the algorithm is measured by the extent to which reproduction errors are visible. As a result, a model that predicts human perceptual sensitivity to image distortion is beneficial to both the design and evaluation of many such image processing algorithms. This summary briefly describes an extension of our work on perceptual image distortion. Our extended perceptual model accounts for: (1) contrast sensitivity as a function of spatial frequency, mean luminance and spatial extent, (2) luminance masking, and (3) contrast masking.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11607","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11607/00537485.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.537485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.537485","startPage":"343","endPage":"345 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model of perceptual image fidelity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537485/","displayDocTitle":"A model of perceptual image fidelity","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5241960","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model of perceptual image fidelity","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00537485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029388S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"23","articleId":"537485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":537496,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Also, to ensure the convergence of the network and its clinical utility with useful results, the minimization is achieved in such a way that after a prespecified period of time, the energy function can reach a local minimum, close to the global minimum, and remains there ever after.

In its most general form, this problem can be broken up into three sub-problems: registration, restoration, and interpolation. Previous work has either solved all three sub-problems independently, or more recently, solved either the first two steps (registration and restoration) or the last two steps together. However, none of the existing methods solve all three sub-problems simultaneously. This paper poses the low resolution to high resolution problem as a maximum likelihood (ML) problem which is solved by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By exploiting the structure of the matrices involved, the problem ran be solved in the discrete frequency domain. The ML problem is then the estimation of the sub-pixel shifts, the noise variances of each image, the power spectra of the high resolution image, and the high resolution image itself. Experimental results are shown which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.537535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.537535","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11607/00537535.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"542 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of a high-resolution image by simultaneous registration, restoration, and interpolation of low-resolution images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of a high-resolution image by simultaneous registration, restoration, and interpolation of low-resolution images","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5242005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of a high-resolution image by simultaneous registration, restoration, and interpolation of low-resolution images","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00537535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035377S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"75","articleId":"537535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":537549,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

The problem is challenging because: 1) searching a large image is computationally expensive; and 2) small targets (on the order of a few pixels in size) have relatively few distinctive features which enable them to be distinguished from non-targets. To overcome these challenges the authors have developed a hierarchical neural network architecture which combines multiresolution pyramid processing with neural networks. Here the authors discuss the application of their hierarchical neural network architecture to the problem of detecting microcalcifications in digital mammograms. Microcalcifications are cues for breast tumors. 30% to 50% of breast carcinomas have microcalcifications visible in mammograms while 60% to 80% of all breast tumors eventually show microcalcifications via histology. Similar to the building/ATR problem, microcalcifications are generally very small point-like objects (<10 pixels in mammograms) which are hard to detect. Radiologists must often exploit other information in the imagery (e.g. location of blood vessels, ducts, etc.) in order to detect these microcalcifications. Here the authors examine how well their hierarchical neural network architecture learns and exploits contextual information in mammograms.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.537602","startPage":"149","endPage":"151 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.537602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11608","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11608/00537602.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical neural network architecture that learns target context: applications to digital mammography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537602/","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical neural network architecture that learns target context: applications to digital mammography","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5256008","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical neural network architecture that learns target context: applications to digital mammography","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00537602.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026771S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"3","articleId":"537602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":537611,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

The proposed algorithm circumvents problems in the motion compensation loop such as illumination variations, noise, and occlusions, by providing a mechanism for alternating between intraframe and residual coding.

When pattern classes are clearly separated, such learning usually provides very fast and yet satisfactory learning performance. Application examples including OCR and (finite) face/object recognition. Different tactics are needed when dealing with overlapping distribution and/or issues on false acceptance/rejection, which arises in applications such as face recognition and verification. For this, a probabilistic DBNN would be more appealing. This paper investigates several training rules augmenting probabilistic DBNN learning, based largely on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The objective is to establish evidence that the probabilistic DBNN offers an effective tool for multi-sensor classification. Two approaches to multi-sensor classification are proposed and the (enhanced) performance studied. The first involves a hierarchical classification, where sensor information are cascaded in sequential processing stages. The second is multi-sensor fusion, where sensor information are laterally combined to yield improved classification. For the experimental studies, a hierarchical DBNN-based face recognition system is described. For a 38-person face database, the hierarchical classification significantly reduces the false acceptance (from 9.35% to 0%) and false rejection (from 7.29% to 2.25%), as compared to non-hierarchical face recognition. Another promising multiple-sensor classifier fusing face and palm biometric features is also proposed.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.537624","startPage":"236","endPage":"239 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.537624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11608","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11608/00537624.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic DBNN via expectation-maximization with multi-sensor classification applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537624/","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic DBNN via expectation-maximization with multi-sensor classification applications","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5256030","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic DBNN via expectation-maximization with multi-sensor classification applications","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00537624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049023S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"3","articleId":"537624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":537626,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The method uses a sub-pixel registration algorithm which describes image motion within the ROI with sub-pixel accuracy as deformation of quadrilateral patches covering the ROI and then performs a sub-pixel registration by warping an observed image with the warping functions recovered from the deformed quadrilateral patches. However, the size of quadrilateral patches depends on curvature of an object's surface, and hence it is extremely difficult to determine the proper size. To solve this problem, we introduce a hierarchical patch splitting algorithm for controlling spatial fineness of quadrilateral patches. The experimental simulations demonstrate that the temporal integration imaging method equipped with the capability of automatically controlling spatial fineness of quadrilateral patches works well for a smoothly curved surface the local geometrical structure of which can be well approximated as a rigid two-dimensional plane.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537626/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5256032","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution image acquisition based on temporal integration with hierarchical estimation of image warping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution image acquisition based on temporal integration with hierarchical estimation of image warping","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00537626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055006S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"4","articleId":"537626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":537627,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

The approach provides an interface (or filter) between the encoder and the network, with which the encoder's output can be perfectly matched to the network's quality of service characteristics. Since the presented algorithms do not require interaction with the encoder, they are fully applicable to precoded, stored video (e.g., video-on-demand systems). By decoupling the encoder and the network, universal interoperability can be achieved. In essence, DRS bridges the gap between CBR and VBR video, allowing a continuum of possibilities between the two. A set of low-complexity algorithms for so-called unconstrained dynamic rate shaping are presented, and both optimal and extremely fast designs are discussed.

Classification is performed by a modified version of a four-layer probabilistic neural network (PNN) called the edited PNN (EPNN). Due to an editing and condensation procedure on the training samples, the EPNN has better performance and the network size is smaller. The performance of the system is evaluated on a database consisting of 2600 digits written by 10 different people. The obtained recognition accuracy is 97.8 percent. The developed system can process approximately two digits per second on a Intel 486 based PC with a 66 MHz clock.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537665/","accessionNumber":"5256080","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of handwritten Persian/Arabic numerals by shadow coding and an edited probabilistic neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of handwritten Persian/Arabic numerals by shadow coding and an edited probabilistic neural network","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00537665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025493S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"13","articleId":"537665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":537667,"authors":[{"name":"E.P.

This criterion not only considers the magnitude but also the directive information of the pixel elements in the block. A simple adaptive block matching algorithm is also developed to adjust the search origin and search range at a block-by-block basis. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves similar MSE performance for motion-predicted images but requires about 8 times less the number of computations than the full-search method.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4052/11608/00537680.pdf","startPage":"496","endPage":"499 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1995.537680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1995.537680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11608","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=537680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive block matching motion estimation algorithm using bit-plane matching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Image sequences","Distance measurement","Partitioning algorithms","Australia","Computational modeling","Image coding","Heuristic algorithms","Testing","Area measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","image matching","motion estimation","prediction theory","motion compensation","data compression","video coding","correlation methods","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive block matching motion estimation algorithm","bit plane matching","distance measurement","directive information","magnitude information","pixel elements","search origin","search range","simulation results","MSE performance","motion predicted images","motion compensation","image sequences","video compression","temporal correlation","frames"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive block matching motion estimation algorithm using bit-plane matching","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5256094","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive block matching motion estimation algorithm using bit-plane matching","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00537680.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044329S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052","citationCount":"32","articleId":"537680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":537684,"authors":[{"name":"B.

An extension of the backpropagation algorithm which uses interval arithmetic is employed to accept fuzzy numbers as inputs to the network using /spl alpha/-level set representation. The learning phase of the neural network is supervised by two fuzzy systems which control the learning rate and the slope of the activation functions. A method for fuzzification of the training data set is proposed. The FNN is compared with a traditional backpropagation network in terms of generalisation capabilities. The training and testing are carried out using data with high degree of ambiguity and overlapping among the classes. The results suggest that the FNN provides a robust classification response in the presence of uncertainty and ambiguity in the training data.

Often the number of such samples is limited, thus limiting the precision with which class characteristics can be estimated. As the number of spectral bands becomes large, the limitation on performance imposed by the limited number of training samples can become severe. Such consequences suggest the value of reducing the dimensionality by a pre-processing method that takes advantage of the asymptotic normality of projected data. Using a technique called projection pursuit, a pre-processing dimensional reduction method has been developed based on the optimization of a projection index. A method to estimate an initial value that can more quickly lead to the global maximum is presented for projection pursuit using the Bhattacharyya distance as the projection index.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1995.537792","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

The proposed testing approach is based on an unusual ANN behavior manifested by faulted ANNs having apparent better performance than fault-free ANNs when neurons are operated with low activation function gains. Although transient, this noncoherent behavior can be used to detect interconnection deletion faults in ANNs. Using mathematical and simulation models, the efficacy of the low activation gain fault detection (LAGFD) method for fault detection is determined. Further, suggested design rules are stated enabling reasonable detection of interconnection deletion faults. A test algorithm is described that identifies a fault-free subset of an ANN using LAGFD. Finally, simulation examples are presented to verify the LAGFD test algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1995.537803","pdfPath":"/iel3/4021/11539/00537803.pdf","startPage":"462","endPage":"467 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

Given combinatorial problems, it is important to develop an efficient representational scheme and effective genetic operators of the GA for better performance. Many representational schemes exist to encode ordering information of jobs and/or operations, which have their own advantages and shortcomings. For better performance, we use both job-ordered list on each machine and operation list representational schemes for a crossover and mutations, respectively, and develop a new crossover, so called, an active schedule constructive crossover (ASCX) and two mutations. This crossover can exchange meaningful ordering information of parents effectively without producing illegal solutions and the mutations can easily provide various operation orderings. Simulation results on five benchmark problems show that our genetic operators are very powerful and suitable to job shop scheduling problems and our GA outperforms the previous GA-based approaches and the GA with position-based crossover (PBX).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct 1995","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5119876","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of genetic algorithm to job shop scheduling problems with active schedule constructive crossover","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of genetic algorithm to job shop scheduling problems with active schedule constructive crossover","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00537816.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0312S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4021","citationCount":"2","articleId":"537816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":537833,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Also the authors propose some reliability factor decision rules in the type-classification net and alphabet classification nets to recover some classification errors.

Finally, the authors extend their two-objective genetic algorithm to a hybrid algorithm where a learning method is applied to each individual (i.e., each rule set) generated in the execution of the two-objective genetic algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/537970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"5126021","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 1995","isConference":true,"volume":"2","displayDocTitle":"Selecting linguistic classification rules by two-objective genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selecting linguistic classification rules by two-objective genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00537970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040358S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4021","citationCount":"23","articleId":"537970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":537993,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The multi-spectral nature of MRI has been exploited in the past to obtain better performance in the segmentation process. The new emerging field of artificial neural networks promises to provide improved solutions for the pattern classification of medical images. The authors present the application of a learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network for the multispectral supervised classification of MR images. The authors have modified the LVQ for better and more accurate classification. The authors compare the results using multispectral images to those with a single slice image. This comparison shows that the authors' method is insensitive to the gray-level variation of MR images between different slices. Also, a comparison with the classical maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) demonstrates the superiority of the authors' LVQ ANN approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1995.538013","startPage":"1665","endPage":"1670 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

Before they are to be applied, a fixed parameter /spl alpha/ should be predetermined. The authors think if the parameter /spl alpha/ is well adjusted, it may also be useful to recover an image from a less densely sampled image. Experiments show that interpolation error relies greatly on the parameter /spl alpha/ and the best values of /spl alpha/ for certain images are much different. Therefore, how to determine the values of /spl alpha/ becomes the key problem for this application. In this paper, the authors develop a neural network based adaptive system to automatically adjust the value of /spl alpha/. A modified robust BP algorithm is used in the training procedure for the authors' special use. Simulation results show that /spl alpha/ can be generated automatically by the neural networks instead of being blindly predetermined to a fixed value. Compared to the interpolator with best fixed parameter /spl alpha/, interpolation results are also improved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1995.538014","publicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

The reduced distance is needed because of the delays of the system. Although it can be changed by hardware improvements, there is a limit to the amount by which the system can be shortened. The purpose of this paper is to develop a predictor that can shorten the distance. We applied a neural network to predict the time series data of the fan noise. Our investigations showed that fan noise had chaotic features and it was possible to predict the near future data of fan noise by a neural network. Applying the predictor using a neural network to active noise control, the prediction improved the performance of active noise control.

The new architecture consists of two key components: a new type of analog neuron, named a \"correlator neuron\", and a \"circadian state bus\". In addition to associating multiple elements, the network has the ability to maintain global and local temporal references, store and recall chronological sequences, associate dissimilar patterns, and dynamically modulate recall characteristics.

Model paradigms that are themselves nonlinear, such as neural networks, potentially offer more accurate and more robust models for these nonlinear systems. This research studies the use of a neural network structure to model a linear system and two nonlinear systems, a quadratic system and a chaotic system. Several training algorithms are used, including traditional back propagation, an evolutionary programming approach, and a hybrid approach. Net architectures studied here consist of a traditional feed forward topology and a radial basis topology. Modified back propagation training using a feed forward network proved adequate for modeling the linear and quadratic systems, but these were hopelessly inadequate in modeling the chaotic system. The radial basis net fared better, but was still a poor performer for projecting the chaotic system beyond the observed data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538159/","accessionNumber":"5132731","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network topologies and training algorithms in nonlinear system identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network topologies and training algorithms in nonlinear system identification","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00538159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026229S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4021","citationCount":"3","articleId":"538159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":538178,"authors":[{"name":"Y.L.

The main difference between the proposed technique and the existing feedback error learning (FEL) technique of Kawato et al. is that compensation of robot dynamics uncertainties is done outside the control loop by modifying the desired input trajectory. By using different NN training signals, two NN control algorithms are developed. One is comparable to that in the FEL technique and the another involves the Jacobian of the PD controlled robot dynamic system. Performances of both controllers with different trajectories and PD controller gains are examined and compared with that of the FEL controller.

These needs are universal, whether they be for terrestrial-based or nonterrestrial-based power delivery systems, namely the NASA Space Station Alpha (Alpha). In this paper, we present a comparison of feature extractors suitable to the training and consultation phases for a fault diagnosis tool based on a two-stage ANN clustering algorithm. One of the prime concerns in selecting an appropriate feature extractor is to provide the ANN with enough significant details in the pattern set so that the highest degree of accuracy in the ANN's performance can be obtained. Candidate feature extractors include time domain analysis, frequency-domain analysis using the fast Fourier transform and the Hartley transform, and wavelet domain analysis using the wavelet transform. Simulated fault studies on a small system are performed and results presented to illustrate the performance capabilities of the respective feature extractor coupled ANN clustering algorithm sets.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSMC.1995.538349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11542","startPage":"3615","endPage":"3623 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

A wide range of methodologies and models have been developed over the years to predict the future load with reasonable accuracy and reliability. Several research groups have studied the use of artificial neural networks for this application and reported superior results compared to the conventional approaches. Application of fuzzy systems has also been proposed to include imprecise and probabilistic information in the input data. Synthesis of these two complementary technologies has emerged as a highly promising approach for electric load forecasting. This paper aims to provide an overview of the published literature on this topic, highlighting common features and drawing out some important aspects of the methodology used.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538416/","accessionNumber":"5144832","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Survey of hybrid fuzzy neural approaches to electric load forecasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Survey of hybrid fuzzy neural approaches to electric load forecasting","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00538416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030706S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct 1995","isNumber":"11543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4021","citationCount":"39","articleId":"538416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":538423,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By considering the imprecise nature of human judgements, we assume that the decision maker (DM) may have a fuzzy goal for each of the objective functions. Having elicited the corresponding linear membership functions, if the DM specifies the reference membership levels for all the membership functions, the corresponding Pareto optimal solution which is, in the minimax sense, nearest to the requirement can be obtained by solving the minimax problem. Here it is shown that the formulated minimax problem can be reduced to one master problem and a number of linear subproblems and the Pareto optimal solution together with the trade-off rate information between the membership functions can be obtained by applying the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method. In this way, the satisficing solution for the DM can be derived from Pareto optimal solutions by updating the current reference membership levels on the basis of the current levels of the membership functions together with the trade-off rates between the membership functions.","displayPublicationTitle":"1995 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics.

If an application is insufficiently constrained, it will not yield a unique optimal solution. Traditionally, underconstrained problems may be solved manually, applying engineering judgment to select the most plausible of a range of solutions which meet the initial set of constraints. The engineering judgment used to select good solutions is often qualitative and may even include contradictory elements. This paper addresses the issue of incorporating engineering judgment into the objective function of an optimizer in order to restrict the range of solutions. Fuzzy logic is used to represent engineering judgment since it is able to represent the qualitative nature of the knowledge and give an assessment of the overall quality of each solution. The approach has been used successfully to match a physically based gas turbine blade cooling design model to experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/41.538610","startPage":"535","endPage":"540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.538610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11565","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/11565/00538610.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of fuzzy logic to describe constraints derived from engineering judgment in genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538610/","displayDocTitle":"Use of fuzzy logic to describe constraints derived from engineering judgment in genetic algorithms","volume":"43","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5394120","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of fuzzy logic to describe constraints derived from engineering judgment in genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00538610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046457S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"5","articleId":"538610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":538611,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It had been widely used in many commercial and industrial products, ranging from electronic dailies/dictionaries to wireless voice digit dialers. DTW has the advantages of fast training and searching times, which makes it more popular than other available ASR techniques. However, there exist some limitations to DTW, such as the stringent rule on slope weighting, the nontrivial computation of the K-best paths, and the significant increase in computational time when the endpoint constraint is relaxed or the variations of the length of pattern increased. In this paper, a stochastic method called the genetic algorithm (GA), which is used to solve the nonlinear time alignment problem, is presented. Experimental results show that the GA has a better performance than the DTW. In addition, two derivatives of GA: the hybrid GA and the parallel GA are also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5394123","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"43","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm for optimizing the nonlinear time alignment of automatic speech recognition systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm for optimizing the nonlinear time alignment of automatic speech recognition systems","sourcePdf":"00538613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040036S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"15","articleId":"538613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":538614,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

The paper includes results of simulation experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed genetic algorithm approach.","doi":"10.1109/41.538614","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/11565/00538614.pdf","startPage":"567","endPage":"574","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.538614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm tuning of Lyapunov-based controllers: an application to a single-link flexible robot system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm tuning of Lyapunov-based controllers: an application to a single-link flexible robot system","volume":"43","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5394124","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm tuning of Lyapunov-based controllers: an application to a single-link flexible robot system","sourcePdf":"00538614.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042167S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"46","articleId":"538614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":538615,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

The mechanisms employed to facilitate multiobjective search with the genetic algorithm are described with the aid of an example. It is shown that the MOGA confers a number of advantages over conventional multiobjective optimization methods by evolving a family of Pareto-optimal solutions rather than a single solution estimate. This allows the engineer to examine the trade-offs between the different design objectives and configurations during the course of an optimization. In addition, the paper demonstrates how the genetic algorithm can be used to search in both controller structure and parameter space thereby offering a potentially more general approach to optimization in controller design than traditional numerical methods.

Procedures which start with a coarse mesh and attempt serious refinements, as is the case in most adaptive finite-element packages, are time consuming and costly. Hence, it is very important to develop a tool that can provide a mesh that either leads immediately to an acceptable solution, or would require fewer correcting steps to achieve better results. In this paper, we present a technique for automatic mesh generation based on artificial neural networks (ANN). The essence of this technique is to predict the mesh density distribution of a given model, and then supply this information to a Kohonen neural network, which provides the final mesh. Prediction of mesh density is accomplished by a simple feedforward neural network which has the ability to learn the relationship between mesh density and model geometric features. It will be shown that ANN are able to recognize delicate areas where a sharp variation of the magnetic field is expected. Examples of 2-D models are provided to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538619/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5395352","volume":"32","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automatic finite-element mesh generation using artificial neural networks-Part I: Prediction of mesh density","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic finite-element mesh generation using artificial neural networks-Part I: Prediction of mesh density","sourcePdf":"00538619.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053594S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"18","articleId":"538619","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":538624,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.C.

The optimization of the coded-equalization scheme for this channel requires balancing the coding rate with its associated distance gain and equalization loss. A major concern in a coded-equalization scheme using decision feedback equalization (DFE) is error propagation. A new indicator to measure the effect of error propagation when using soft decision decoding is proposed. For medium to high normalized recording densities (S>1.5), it is shown that error propagation significantly degrades the theoretical performance of a detection scheme which combines a partial response DFE and simple trellis codes. In fact, this combined system performs worse than the uncoded one. The addition of delayed decision feedback sequence estimation (DDFSE) to limit the effect of error propagation is then investigated. With a moderate decoding complexity, positive coding gains have been achieved at such densities when choosing the partial response polynomial according to the derived indicator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5395357","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Combined partial response decision feedback equalization and coding for the Lorentzian channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined partial response decision feedback equalization and coding for the Lorentzian channel","sourcePdf":"00538624.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040768S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"3","articleId":"538624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":538650,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

From a basic point of view, noise properties of nonlinear optical amplifiers are sufficiently different from those of linear amplifiers to warrant detailed modeling which has not been formulated previously. From a practical point of view, nonlinear semiconductor optical amplifiers are important for future all-optical signal-processing applications which may involve the operation of these devices in a saturated regime. Nonlinear amplifiers are also common in systems operating near 1300 nm and in integrated booster amplifiers. Under nonlinear operating conditions, amplifier noise contains a narrow-band contribution that comes about due to the nonlinear coupling of noise and gain. The more conventional broadband spontaneous noise also changes as the inversion factor becomes power-dependent and varies along the amplifier axis. We analyze noise in nonlinear amplifiers in the Gaussian limit (meaning, for fields consisting of large photon numbers) for CW or NRZ modulated signals and separately for short pulses. We consider the case of a single input as well as configurations of multi-input signals interacting via four-wave mixing. Using a specific detection system for the calculations of electronic signal-to-noise ratios, we demonstrate a reduction in the narrow-band electronic noise due to saturation in the single input case. We also demonstrate a vast advantage of using short pulses in four-wave-mixing applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical noise","Semiconductor device noise","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Pulse amplifiers","Narrowband","Pulse modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Nonlinear optical devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical saturation","multiwave mixing","semiconductor lasers","semiconductor device models","laser noise","semiconductor device noise","optical information processing","electro-optical modulation","Gaussian noise","laser theory","laser transitions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise characteristics","nonlinear semiconductor optical amplifiers","Gaussian limit","noise properties","nonlinear optical amplifiers","modeling","all-optical signal-processing applications","saturated regime","integrated booster amplifiers","narrow-band contribution","nonlinear coupling","broadband spontaneous noise","inversion factor","power-dependent","amplifier axis","large photon numbers","NRZ modulated signals","short pulses","multi-input signals","four-wave mixing","detection system","electronic signal-to-noise ratios","1300 nm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3.538787","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/11592/00538787.pdf","startPage":"1801","endPage":"1809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.538787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise characteristics of nonlinear semiconductor optical amplifiers in the Gaussian limit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=538787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Noise characteristics of nonlinear semiconductor optical amplifiers in the Gaussian limit","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538787/","volume":"32","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5401967","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise characteristics of nonlinear semiconductor optical amplifiers in the Gaussian limit","sourcePdf":"00538787.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044132S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"42","articleId":"538787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":538788,"authors":[{"name":"N.C.

The power dependence of FWM coupling coefficients and ultrafast relaxation-related gain mechanisms are included in the model. By studying the FWM efficiency in the transition from unsaturated to strongly saturated regions, it is seen that gain asymmetry results in deviation from small-signal models when the pump-probe detuning and pump powers are small. At high pump injection or gain conditions, it is also shown that the small-signal model breaks down even for relatively large detuning frequencies. Probe depletion is also seen to be critical under saturated conditions and an upper bound is derived for ranges of input pump power, pump-probe detuning, and gain for a given amplifier under which the small-signal model is valid.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Frequency conversion","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Optical frequency conversion","Couplings","Partial differential equations","Optical wavelength conversion","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor lasers","optical pumping","optical saturation","symmetry","multiwave mixing","laser theory","optical couplers","semiconductor device models","laser tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gain saturation","gain asymmetry","pump/probe depletion","wavelength conversion efficiency","FWM","semiconductor optical amplifiers","conversion efficiency","four-wave mixing","power dependence","FWM coupling coefficients","ultrafast relaxation-related gain mechanisms","FWM efficiency","strongly saturated regions","unsaturated regions","small-signal models","pump-probe detuning","pump powers","high pump injection","large detuning frequencies","saturated conditions","input pump power","small-signal model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3.538788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/11592/00538788.pdf","startPage":"1810","endPage":"1816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.538788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of gain saturation, gain asymmetry, and pump/probe depletion on wavelength conversion efficiency of FWM in semiconductor optical amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=538788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of gain saturation, gain asymmetry, and pump/probe depletion on wavelength conversion efficiency of FWM in semiconductor optical amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538788/","volume":"32","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5401968","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of gain saturation, gain asymmetry, and pump/probe depletion on wavelength conversion efficiency of FWM in semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00538788.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039573S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"26","articleId":"538788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":538791,"authors":[{"name":"Delong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Precision Instrument Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Delong Zhang","id":"37087348919"},{"name":"Caihe Chen","affiliation":["Department of Precision Instrument Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Caihe Chen","id":"37087348211"},{"name":"Jiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Jiang Li","id":"37087170591"},{"name":"Guilan Ding","affiliation":["Department of Precision Instrument Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Guilan Ding","id":"37087347399"},{"name":"Xiaojun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Xiaojun Chen","id":"37087380102"},{"name":"Yuming Cui","affiliation":["Department of Precision Instrument Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yuming Cui","id":"37087348377"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9197"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1713"}],"articleNumber":"538791","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=538791","abstract":"A detailed theoretical procedure of determining the mode sizes of fundamental mode field distribution in a coaxially pumped Ti-diffused Er:LiNbO/sub 3/ waveguide laser has been described.

Consequently, the quality of an image formed on the screen deteriorates what can be visually perceived as the image distortion and degradation of the color purity. In this paper, we describe a computer suite developed for the design and numerical modeling of inner magnetic shielding assemblies employed to minimize this negative field-beam interaction for trinitron type tubes. Till now such assemblies were mostly designed by an expensive experimentation based on the 'cut and try' approach. By applying the 3-D finite element method the actual magnetic characteristics of assembly parts formed magnetically by degaussing, the grille anisotropy and the frame bulkiness can be considered. Also, a set of design tools developed to evaluate the assembly shielding performance is described.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of inner magnetic shielding assemblies in cathode ray tubes by 3-dimensional finite element method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.538849","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/11570/00538849.pdf","startPage":"4299","endPage":"4301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.538849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11570","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=538849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538849/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of inner magnetic shielding assemblies in cathode ray tubes by 3-dimensional finite element method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","accessionNumber":"5414775","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of inner magnetic shielding assemblies in cathode ray tubes by 3-dimensional finite element method","sourcePdf":"00538849.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037699S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","articleId":"538849","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":538855,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The enhancement-layer bitstream(s) contain less information, so that packet losses are more easily tolerated. The MPEG-2 standard provides four methods to produce a layered video bitstream: data partitioning, signal-to-noise ratio scalability, spatial scalability, and temporal scalability. Each was included in the standard in part for motivations other than loss resilience. This paper compares the performance of these techniques (excluding temporal scalability) under various loss rates using realistic length material and discusses their relative merits. Nonlayered MPEG-2 coding gives generally unacceptable video quality for packet loss ratios of 10/sup -3/ for small packet sizes. Better performance can be obtained using layered coding and dual-priority transmission. With data partitioning, cell loss ratios of 10/sup -4/ in the low-priority layer are definitely acceptable, while for SNR scalable encoding, cell loss ratios of 10/sup -3/ are generally invisible. Spatial scalable encoding can provide even better visual quality under packet losses; however, it has a high implementation complexity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.538925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11596","startPage":"426","endPage":"435","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/11596/00538925.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet loss resilience of MPEG-2 scalable video coding algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Packet loss resilience of MPEG-2 scalable video coding algorithms","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5403538","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet loss resilience of MPEG-2 scalable video coding algorithms","sourcePdf":"00538925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047444S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"128","articleId":"538925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":538926,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The main novelty of the proposed method is the motion compensation algorithm which has been designed with low computational complexity as an important criterion. Subsampled blocks are used in block matching and the vector search range is constrained to the most likely motion vectors.

The computed sensitivity (true positive (TP) detection rate) was 90.1% with an average low false positive (FP) detection of 0.71 MCCs/image for the enhanced images using a modified k-fold validation error estimation technique. The corresponding computed sensitivity for the raw images was reduced to 81.4% and with 0.59 FP's MCCs/image.

The BNN clustering algorithm is developed to initially segment an image into a number of regions. Then the segmented regions are labeled with the CSBNN, which is a modified version of BNN. The CSBNN uses a knowledge base that contains information on image-feature space and tissue models as constraints. The method is tested using sets of MR brain images.

In experiments with synthetic noise-free and additive noisy projection data of dental phantoms, it is found that both simultaneous iterative algorithms produce superior image quality as compared to filtered backprojection after linearly fitting projection gaps. Furthermore, the EM-type algorithm converges faster than the ART-type algorithm in terms of either the I-divergence or Euclidean distance between ideal and reprojected data in the authors' simulation. Also, for a given iteration number, the EM-type deblurring method produces better image clarity but stronger noise than the ART-type reconstruction. The computational complexity of EM- and ART-based iterative deblurring is essentially the same, dominated by reprojection and backprojection. Relevant practical and theoretical issues are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/42.538943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/11597/00538943.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.538943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11597","startPage":"657","endPage":"664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative deblurring for CT metal artifact reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=538943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative deblurring for CT metal artifact reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5401007","pubMedId":"18215947","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative deblurring for CT metal artifact reduction","sourcePdf":"00538943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049241S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"249","articleId":"538943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":538946,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is an often-used iterative approach for maximizing the Poisson likelihood in ECT because of its attractive theoretical and practical properties. Its major disadvantage is that, due to its slow rate of convergence, a large amount of computation is often required to achieve an acceptable image. Here, the authors present a row-action maximum likelihood algorithm (RAMLA) as an alternative to the EM algorithm for maximizing the Poisson likelihood in ECT. The authors deduce the convergence properties of this algorithm and demonstrate by way of computer simulations that the early iterates of RAMLA increase the Poisson likelihood in ECT at an order of magnitude faster that the standard EM algorithm. Specifically, the authors show that, from the point of view of measuring total radionuclide uptake in simulated brain phantoms, iterations 1, 2, 3, and 4 of RAMLA perform at least as well as iterations 45, 60, 70, and 80, respectively, of EM. Moreover, the authors show that iterations 1, 2, 3, and 4 of RAMLA achieve comparable likelihood values as iterations 45, 60, 70, and 80, respectively, of EM. The authors also present a modified version of a recent fast ordered subsets EM (OS-EM) algorithm and show that RAMLA is a special case of this modified OS-EM. Furthermore, the authors show that their modification converges to a ML solution whereas the standard OS-EM does not.","doi":"10.1109/42.538946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/11597/00538946.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.538946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A row-action alternative to the EM algorithm for maximizing likelihood in emission tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=538946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538946/","displayDocTitle":"A row-action alternative to the EM algorithm for maximizing likelihood in emission tomography","volume":"15","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5401010","pubMedId":"18215950","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A row-action alternative to the EM algorithm for maximizing likelihood in emission tomography","sourcePdf":"00538946.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05584S","chronDate":"Oct.  1996","isNumber":"11597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"277","articleId":"538946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":538949,"authors":[{"name":"L.H.

The parameterization decomposes the surface into sinusoidal basis functions. Four types of surfaces are modeled: tori, open surfaces, closed surfaces and tubes. This parameterization allows a wide variety of smooth surfaces to be described with a small number of parameters.

It is shown that dispersion significantly limits the transmission distance in intensity modulated direct detection links operating in the above 20 GHz frequency region by inducing a carrier to noise penalty on the transmitted signal. At 60 GHz, a 1 dB penalty is induced after less than 500 m transmission over standard single-mode fiber with a dispersion of 17 ps/km/spl middot/nm and the signal is completely extinct after 1 km. In remote heterodyne detection links, the dispersion induces both a carrier to noise penalty and a phase noise increase on the transmitted signal. It is shown, however, that the induced carrier to noise penalty is insignificant. At 60 GHz, the induced penalty is less than 0.3 dB after 100 km transmission. The phase noise increase proves more dominant. At 60 GHz, a 150 Mbit/s QPSK signal is limited to around 10 km of transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chromatic dispersion in fiber-optic microwave and millimeter-wave links","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.538964","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/11667/00538964.pdf","startPage":"1716","endPage":"1724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.538964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11667","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=538964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538964/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Chromatic dispersion in fiber-optic microwave and millimeter-wave links","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5408665","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chromatic dispersion in fiber-optic microwave and millimeter-wave links","sourcePdf":"00538964.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039922S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"365","articleId":"538964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":538966,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

We then present a taxonomy of visual servo control systems. The two major classes of systems, position-based and image-based systems, are then discussed in detail. Since any visual servo system must be capable of tracking image features in a sequence of images, we also include an overview of feature-based and correlation-based methods for tracking.

Position based visual servo control requires the explicit calculation of the relative position and orientation (POSE) of the workpiece object with respect to the camera. This is accomplished using image plane measurements of a number of known feature points on the object, and then applying an extended Kalman filter to obtain a recursive solution of the photogrammetric equations, and to properly combine redundant measurements. The control is then designed by specifying the desired trajectories with respect to the object and forming the control error in the end-effector frame. The implementation using a distributed computer architecture is described. An experimental system has been built and used to evaluate the performance of the POSE estimation and the position based visual servo control. Several results for relative trajectory control and target tracking are presented. Results of the experiments showing the effect of loss of some of the redundant features are also presented.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/11632/00538974.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"696","doi":"10.1109/70.538974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.538974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relative end-effector control using Cartesian position based visual servoing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Relative end-effector control using Cartesian position based visual servoing","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5403118","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relative end-effector control using Cartesian position based visual servoing","sourcePdf":"00538974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034478S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"434","articleId":"538974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":538976,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

This implies that traditional sensor integration techniques that require common data representations are not appropriate for combining the feedback from these two disparate sensors. In this paper, we introduce the concept of vision and force sensor resolvability as a means of comparing the ability of the two sensing modes to provide useful information during robotic manipulation tasks. By monitoring the resolvability of the two sensing modes with respect to the task, the information provided by the disparate sensors can be seamlessly assimilated during task execution. A nonlinear force/vision servoing algorithm that uses force and vision resolvability to switch manipulator control between sensors is proposed. The advantages of the assimilation technique are demonstrated during contact transitions between a stiff manipulator and a rigid environment, a system configuration that easily becomes unstable when force control alone is used. Experimental results show that robust contact transitions are made by the proposed nonlinear controller while simultaneously satisfying the conflicting task requirements of fast approach velocities, maintaining stability, minimizing impact forces, and suppressing bounce between contact surfaces.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538976/","volume":"12","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5403120","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Force and vision resolvability for assimilating disparate sensory feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force and vision resolvability for assimilating disparate sensory feedback","sourcePdf":"00538976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060897S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"74","articleId":"538976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":538979,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

For any given robot vision task, all possible appearance variations define its visual workspace. A set of images is obtained by coarsely sampling the workspace. The image set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional subspace, called the eigenspace, in which the visual workspace is represented as a continuous appearance manifold. Given an unknown input image, the recognition system first projects the image to eigenspace. The parameters of the vision task are recognized based on the exact location of the projection on the appearance manifold. An efficient algorithm for finding the closest manifold point is described.

We analyze an image-based controller, whose implementation requires the robot Jacobian, the gravitational torque vector, and the camera orientation. Further, the robot manipulator is not treated as an ideal positioning device but modeled by the Lagrangian dynamics. We formally prove that the overall closed-loop system composed by the full nonlinear robot dynamics and the controller is Lyapunov stable.

The method couples the stochastic search of a Partially Elitistic Genetic Algorithm with a local search procedure. Up to 19 equivalent circuit elements have been included in the small-signal model for completeness and flexibility. Optimization examples are given for an ion-implanted MESFET up to 12 GHz, a pseudomorphic HEMT up to 50 GHz, and for synthetic data. The results show that the proposed algorithm is able to consistently provide an excellent fit between measured and calculated S-parameters without any need of a careful initial guess for the circuit element values. Also, once the device parasitics have been de-embedded, the algorithm is able to extract unique, physically meaningful values for the intrinsic device parameters, and it is numerically shown not to be affected by measurement uncertainties.","doi":"10.1109/81.538990","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/11669/00538990.pdf","startPage":"839","endPage":"847","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.538990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-signal modeling for microwave FET linear circuits based on a genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Small-signal modeling for microwave FET linear circuits based on a genetic algorithm","volume":"43","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5416591","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-signal modeling for microwave FET linear circuits based on a genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00538990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045287S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"38","articleId":"538990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":538992,"authors":[{"name":"Leang-San Shieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Leang-San Shieh","id":"37087253779"},{"name":"Xiang Zou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Xiang Zou","id":"37087507010"},{"name":"J.S.H.

The system matrices characterizing the state-space representation of the original uncertain systems are assumed to be interval matrices. The exponential matrix-valued function with an interval system matrix is approximated by a rational interval matrix-valued function using the geometric-series approximation method. Then, the desired enclosing interval approximant is obtained by adding an error interval matrix, which accounts for the approximation error, to the rational interval approximant. The model thus constructed is guaranteed to enclose the precise original interval model. The proposed enclosing digital interval model provides less conservative results than the existing Pade enclosing digital interval model. The newly developed digital interval model can be utilized for analysis and design of continuous-time uncertain systems.","doi":"10.1109/81.538992","startPage":"851","endPage":"854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.538992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11669","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/11669/00538992.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model conversion of continuous-time uncertain systems via the interval geometric-series method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/538992/","displayDocTitle":"Model conversion of continuous-time uncertain systems via the interval geometric-series method","volume":"43","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5416593","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model conversion of continuous-time uncertain systems via the interval geometric-series method","sourcePdf":"00538992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047884S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"15","articleId":"538992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":538996,"authors":[{"name":"P.

As is well known, if the multiplier is represented in Canonical Signed Digit (CSD) form, then the number of additions (or subtractions) used will be a minimum. This paper examines methods for optimizing the design of CSD multipliers, and in particular the gains that can be made by sharing subexpressions. In the case where several multipliers are present in a network of operators, for instance in an FIR filter, the savings achieved by identifying common subexpressions can be as much as 50% of the total number of operators. The asymptotic frequency of the most common subexpression is analyzed mathematically, and it is shown that sharing the two most common subexpressions can be expected to lead to a 33% saving of the number of additions.","doi":"10.1109/82.539000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/11677/00539000.pdf","startPage":"677","endPage":"688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.539000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subexpression sharing in filters using canonic signed digit multipliers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Subexpression sharing in filters using canonic signed digit multipliers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539000/","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5416601","volume":"43","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subexpression sharing in filters using canonic signed digit multipliers","sourcePdf":"00539000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048225S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"418","articleId":"539000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":539001,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The adders studied include the linear time ripple carry and Manchester carry chain adders, the square-root time carry skip and carry select adders, the logarithmic time carry lookahead adder and its variations, and the constant time signed-digit and carry-save adders. Most of the research in the last few decades has concentrated on reducing the delay of addition. With the rising popularity of portable computers, however, the emphasis is on both high speed and low power operation. In this paper we adopt a uniform static CMOS layout methodology whereby short circuit power mininization is used as the optimization criterion. The relative merits of the different adders are evaluated by performing a detailed transistor-level simulation of the adders using HSPICE. Among the two's complement adders, a variation of the carry lookahead adder, called ELM, was found to have the best power-delay product. Based on the results of our experiments, a large adder design space is formulated from which an architect can choose an adder with the desired characteristics.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Circuits","Digital signal processing","Cost function","Computer science","Added delay","Portable computers","Minimization methods","Performance evaluation","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel processing","adders","CMOS logic circuits","integrated circuit layout","carry logic","delays","digital arithmetic","circuit layout CAD","circuit analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area-time-power tradeoffs","power-delay product","parallel adders","synchronous adders","power characteristics","delay characteristics","area characteristics","linear time ripple carry adders","Manchester carry chain adders","square-root time carry skip adders","square-root time carry select adders","logarithmic time carry lookahead adder","constant time signed-digit adders","carry-save adders","low power operation","uniform static CMOS layout methodology","short circuit power minimization","optimization criterion","transistor-level simulation","HSPICE","two's complement adders","carry lookahead adder","ELM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539001","doi":"10.1109/82.539001","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/11677/00539001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.539001","startPage":"689","endPage":"702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area-time-power tradeoffs in parallel adders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Area-time-power tradeoffs in parallel adders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","volume":"43","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5423089","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area-time-power tradeoffs in parallel adders","sourcePdf":"00539001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069198S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"125","articleId":"539001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":539004,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Further, the performance of the proposed algorithm has been found to remain stable even over 1 million updates without suffering from any error accumulation problems.","doi":"10.1109/78.539027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11633/00539027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.539027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11633","startPage":"2413","endPage":"2422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quasi-Newton adaptive algorithm for generalized symmetric eigenvalue problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A quasi-Newton adaptive algorithm for generalized symmetric eigenvalue problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5403553","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quasi-Newton adaptive algorithm for generalized symmetric eigenvalue problem","sourcePdf":"00539027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055267S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"32","articleId":"539027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":539028,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Any of a variety of additive or nonadditive information cost functions can be used as the decision criterion for comparing and selecting nodes when searching through the tree. The algorithms are applicable to tree-structured transforms generated by any kind of wavelet whether orthogonal, biorthogonal, or nonorthogonal. These satisficing search algorithms implement suboptimizing rather than optimizing principles, and acquire the important advantage of reduced computational complexity with significant savings in memory, flops, and time. Despite the suboptimal approach, top-down tree-search algorithms with additive or nonadditive costs that yield near-best bases can be considered, in certain important and practical situations, better than bottom-up tree-search algorithms with additive costs that yield best bases. Here, \"better than\" means that, effectively, the same level of performance can be attained for a relative fraction of the computational work. Experimental results comparing the various information cost functions and basis selection methods are demonstrated for both data compression of real speech and time-frequency analysis of artificial transients.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satisficing search algorithms for selecting near-best bases in adaptive tree-structured wavelet transforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.539028","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11633/00539028.pdf","startPage":"2423","endPage":"2438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.539028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Satisficing search algorithms for selecting near-best bases in adaptive tree-structured wavelet transforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5403554","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satisficing search algorithms for selecting near-best bases in adaptive tree-structured wavelet transforms","sourcePdf":"00539028.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056834S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","articleId":"539028","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":539030,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Since a chaotic signal is inherently deterministic, a new complexity measure called the phase space volume (PSV) is introduced for estimation instead of using the conventional probabilistic measures. We show that the unknown parameters of a signal embedded in chaotic noise ran be obtained by minimizing the PSV (MPSV) of the output of an inverse filter of the received signal in a reconstructed phase space. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to analyze the efficiency of the MPSV method for parameter estimation in chaotic noise. To illustrate the usefulness of the MPSV technique in solving real-life problems, the problem of sinusoidal frequency estimation in real radar clutter (unwanted radar backscatters) is considered. Modeling radar clutter as a chaotic process, we apply the MPSV technique to estimate the sinusoidal frequencies by estimating the coefficients of an autoregressive (AR) spectrum. The results show that the frequency estimates generated by the MPSV method are more accurate than those obtained by the standard least square (LS) technique.","doi":"10.1109/78.539030","startPage":"2456","endPage":"2463","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11633/00539030.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.539030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter estimation in chaotic noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Chaos","Frequency estimation","Volume measurement","Phase measurement","Clutter","Phase estimation","Phase noise","Radio access networks","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency estimation","radar clutter","radar signal processing","chaos","signal reconstruction","Monte Carlo methods","random noise","autoregressive processes","minimisation","filtering theory","phase space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic noise","parameter estimation","complexity measure","phase space volume","unknown parameters","minimization","inverse filter","received signal","reconstructed phase space","Monte Carlo simulations","MPSV method","sinusoidal frequency estimation","radar clutter","unwanted radar backscatter","autoregressive spectrum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation in chaotic noise","volume":"44","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5403556","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation in chaotic noise","sourcePdf":"00539030.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035299S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","articleId":"539030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":539038,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

This subset includes all the wavelets with a corresponding wavelet (polyphase) matrix that can be factored as a product of factors of degree-1 in one variable. In this paper, we consider, in particular, wavelets with vanishing moments. The number of vanishing moments that can be achieved increases with the increase in the McMillan degrees of the wavelet matrix. We design wavelets with the maximal number of vanishing moments for given McMillan degrees by solving a set of nonlinear constraints on the free parameters defining the wavelet matrix and discuss their relation to regular, smooth wavelets. Design examples are given for two fundamental sampling schemes: the quincunx and the four-band separable sampling. The relation of the wavelets to the well-known 1-D Daubechies wavelets with vanishing moments is discussed.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00539041.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11633/00539041.pdf","startPage":"2579","endPage":"2590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.539041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.539041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional orthogonal wavelets with vanishing moments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis","Finite impulse response filter","Filter bank","Sampling methods","Multiresolution analysis","Terminology","Nonlinear filters","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","wavelet transforms","two-dimensional digital filters","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional orthogonal wavelets","vanishing moments","2D orthogonal compactly supported wavelets","wavelet matrix","polyphase matrix","degree-1","McMillan degrees","nonlinear constraints","sampling schemes","quincunx sampling","four-band separable sampling","1-D Daubechies wavelets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional orthogonal wavelets with vanishing moments","volume":"44","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5403567","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional orthogonal wavelets with vanishing moments","sourcePdf":"00539041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082061S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","articleId":"539041","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":539042,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

However, in this architecture, pipelining of the operations within the systolic array cells is difficult. Pipelining would be necessary to operate at high speeds or to reduce the power dissipation in a VLSI implementation. Pipelining QRD-RLS using look-ahead techniques leads to a large hardware overhead. The square-root free forms of QRD-RLS are also difficult to pipeline. In this paper, a new scaled tangent rotation (STAR) is used instead of the Givens rotations used in QRD-RLS. The STAR-based RLS algorithm (referred to as STAR-RLS) is designed such that fine-grain pipelining can be accomplished with little hardware overhead The scaled tangent rotations are not exactly orthogonal transformations but tend to become orthogonal asymptotically. The STAR-RLS algorithm is square-root free and has less complexity and lower intercell communication than the QRD-RLS algorithm. The properties of the STAR-RLS algorithm, such as stability, numerical property, and dynamic range, are examined with and without pipelining and compared with those of QRD-RLS. Simulation results are presented to compare the performance of STAR-RLS and QRD-RLS algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/78.539042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11633/00539042.pdf","startPage":"2591","endPage":"2604","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00539042.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.539042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined RLS adaptive filtering using scaled tangent rotations (STAR)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined RLS adaptive filtering using scaled tangent rotations (STAR)","volume":"44","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5403568","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539042/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined RLS adaptive filtering using scaled tangent rotations (STAR)","sourcePdf":"00539042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039124S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","articleId":"539042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":539043,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

A difficulty with MV methods, however, is their sensitivity to signal wavefront mismatch. In this work, the performance of three robust MV methods and the Bartlett beamformer is evaluated using vertical array data from the Mediterranean Sea collected by the NATO SACLANT Centre. The three MV methods considered are: (1) the reduced MV beamformer (RMV), (2) the MV beamformer with neighborhood location constraints (MV-NLC), (3) the MV beamformer with environmental perturbation constraints (MV-EPC). While the Bartlett, RMV, and MV-NLC methods assume the ocean environment is known precisely, the MV-EPC method models the environment as being random with known statistics. Experimental and companion simulation results indicate that for modest environmental uncertainty, the MV-EPC beamformer achieves a higher probability of correct localization and better sidelobe performance than the other three methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance of matched-field beamformers with Mediterranean vertical array data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.539043","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/11633/00539043.pdf","startPage":"2605","endPage":"2611","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00539043.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.539043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539043/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"The performance of matched-field beamformers with Mediterranean vertical array data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5403569","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance of matched-field beamformers with Mediterranean vertical array data","sourcePdf":"00539043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029403S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"77","articleId":"539043","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":539044,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Jian Mou","affiliation":["Sun Microsystems Computer Company, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhi-Jian Mou","id":"37087561998"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"539044","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":345},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539044","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Nonlinear filters","Digital arithmetic","Interpolation","Instruments","Signal sampling","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","FIR filters","filtering theory","digital filters","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symmetry exploitation","digital interpolators","digital decimators","symmetric FIR filter algorithms","arithmetic operations"]}],"abstract":"This correspondence extends the symmetric FIR filter algorithms of the previous work of the author to the computation of interpolators and decimators.

It is proposed that by making the pinned film element slightly longer than the free layer so that the ends of the free and pinned layers are separated, the edge demagnetization in the free layer can be essentially eliminated.","doi":"10.1109/20.539345","startPage":"4237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/11569/00539345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.539345","endPage":"4239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micromagnetics of spin valve memory cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1996","displayDocTitle":"Micromagnetics of spin valve memory cells","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5414764","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micromagnetics of spin valve memory cells","sourcePdf":"00539345.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026921S","chronDate":"Sept.  1996","isNumber":"11569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"33","articleId":"539345","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":539360,"authors":[{"name":"K.

For spread spectrum multiple access, multiuser interference (interference due to signals from other users) limits the performance of the communication link. To remove this interference, a multiuser interference cancellation technique which utilizes orthogonal convolutional codes has been proposed for the uplink (mobiles to a base station) of the cellular code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. However, this technique requires large interleavers and huge memory, or artificial multipath diversity and a RAKE system to achieve sufficient coding gain if it is applied to wireless indoor communications and fading is slow compared to the data rate. To reduce the complexity of the canceller, multicarrier modulation is employed as it provides frequency diversity gain and coding gain without the interleavers or a RAKE system. This paper shows that multicarrier modulation reduces the complexity of the canceller and still provides sufficient coding gain in order to cancel the multiuser interference. A canceller with decoding in the initial decision and multicarrier modulation improves the capacity by a factor of 1.4 as compared with a canceller without decoding.","doi":"10.1109/49.539404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11643","startPage":"1500","endPage":"1509","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/11643/00539404.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.539404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiuser interference cancellation technique utilizing convolutional codes and orthogonal multicarrier modulation for wireless indoor communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Modulation coding","Convolutional codes","Multiaccess communication","Decoding","Delay","Spread spectrum communication","Mobile communication","Multiple access interference","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","cellular radio","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","modulation coding","convolutional codes","decoding","fading","code division multiple access","multipath channels","channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser interference cancellation","convolutional codes","orthogonal multicarrier modulation","wireless indoor communications","delay","spread spectrum multiple access","communication link performance","uplink","base station","cellular CDMA systems","CDMA systems","coding gain","frequency diversity gain","capacity","decoding","multipath diversity","fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"A multiuser interference cancellation technique utilizing convolutional codes and orthogonal multicarrier modulation for wireless indoor communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"14","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5413810","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiuser interference cancellation technique utilizing convolutional codes and orthogonal multicarrier modulation for wireless indoor communications","sourcePdf":"00539404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043577S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"15","articleId":"539404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":539405,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

The results of a single cell multiuser investigation demonstrate increased traffic capacity. However, this increase is initially very moderate due to corruption of the channel estimates by interference from symbols not yet demodulated and cancelled. A modification in the transmitted signal structure addressing this problem is proposed. The results of a single cell analysis of the modified cancellation scheme demonstrate that the system's traffic capacity reaches approximately 80% of that of a multistage successive interference cancelling receiver operating with the perfect knowledge of channel parameters. A subsequent multicell investigation shows that for a hexagonal cell geometry with a path loss exponent of four and without any forward error correction (FEC) coding or cell sectorization, the system capacity compares very favorably with that of the IS-95 system, which employs powerful error control coding.

The efficiency of a direct-sequence spread-spectrum code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) system depends heavily on the shape of the spectrum of the spread signal. Maximum efficiency is obtained with an ideal brick-wall bandpass spectrum. There are two approaches toward achieving such a spectrum. One is to use a simple spreader that produces a broad spectrum and then follow it with a precise, high order filter to band limit the spectrum. A second approach, which is the approach taken in this paper, is to use a spreader that produces a spectrum close to the ideal spectrum and then employ a simple filter to control the out-of-band power. The proposed spreader/despreader is based on a simple hybrid function and can be easily implemented. An analysis provides a compact expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a RAKE receiver. The expression includes the effects of baseband, intermediate frequency (IF) and RF filtering as well as the effects of the spectral densities of the spreading/despreading functions. The analysis shows that the proposed spreader/despreader yields superior performance over a conventional pseudo noise (PN) spreading/despreading mechanism.","doi":"10.1109/49.539411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/11643/00539411.pdf","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.539411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid spreading/despreading function with good SNR performance for band-limited DS-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539411/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid spreading/despreading function with good SNR performance for band-limited DS-CDMA","volume":"14","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5413817","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid spreading/despreading function with good SNR performance for band-limited DS-CDMA","sourcePdf":"00539411.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04275S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","articleId":"539411","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":539414,"authors":[{"name":"U.

It consists of a bank of matched filters followed by a decorrelating matrix. For proper operation, both the matched filter bank and the decorrelating matrix require knowledge of the delays of all users. The delays are due to the different propagation times from each user to the base station. Delay estimation is a weak link in this system since it is complex and prone to error. The proposed decorrelating detector does not require exact knowledge of the user delays, but instead requires that the delays be bounded to a fraction of a symbol interval. The delays are naturally bounded in this way in many microcell and picocell systems where the round trip propagation time is small compared to the symbol interval. The new delay independent decorrelating detector is shown to be near-far resistant and, through appropriate spreading code selection, to experience a modest 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss relative to orthogonal access schemes. It is also shown to limit capacity to a maximum of 50% of the spreading gain when the delays are bounded by a single chip interval. The complexity is similar to the conventional correlating receiver which is far less complex than the joint detection schemes proposed to date.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A delay independent decorrelating detector for quasi-synchronous CDMA","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.539416","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/11643/00539416.pdf","startPage":"1619","endPage":"1626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.539416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"A delay independent decorrelating detector for quasi-synchronous CDMA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5413822","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A delay independent decorrelating detector for quasi-synchronous CDMA","sourcePdf":"00539416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032902S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"9","articleId":"539416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":539417,"authors":[{"name":"L.D.

It is demonstrated that in a nonfading environment the presence of the narrowband user does not severely affect the acquisition performance when the ratio of its bandwidth to the CDMA bandwidth is small.

Special attention is given to the near-far problem which is catastrophic for the standard acquisition algorithm. An estimator based on subspace identification techniques is proposed, and the Cramer-Rao bound, which serves as an optimality criterion, is derived. The Cramer-Rao bound is shown to be independent of the near-far problem, which implies that there is no fundamental reason for propagation delay estimators to be near-far limited.

Several near-far resistant receivers have, therefore, been proposed (e.g., the decorrelating receiver). These receivers assume perfect knowledge of the propagation delay from all users to the receiver. In practice, the delays are estimated and therefore subject to errors. The performance degradation these errors impose on linear detectors, especially the decorrelating detector, is the topic of this paper.","doi":"10.1109/49.539421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/11643/00539421.pdf","startPage":"1660","endPage":"1668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.539421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of timing errors on the performance of linear DS-CDMA receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"The impact of timing errors on the performance of linear DS-CDMA receivers","volume":"14","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5413827","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539421/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of timing errors on the performance of linear DS-CDMA receivers","sourcePdf":"00539421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058077S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"58","articleId":"539421","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":539422,"authors":[{"name":"B.W.

Idealisation of the flux-linkage characteristics will result in a model which cannot predict the performance of the machine with sufficient accuracy. It is necessary therefore to determine flux-linkage characteristics as closely as possible. In this paper, a method of finding the flux-linkage characteristics is explained. The same method is demonstrated on a commercially available 4 kW, 8/6 pole OULTON SRM. The validity of the test results is checked by computing the static torque characteristics based on the measured flux-linkage characteristics and comparing them with experimentally measured static torque characteristics.

All the control strategies utilize the output speed error and its derivative as feedback damping signals.

Shunt active filters for harmonic compensation with or without reactive power compensation, flicker compensation or voltage regulation have been put on a commercial base in Japan, and their rating or capacity has ranged from 50 kVA to 60 MVA at present. In near future, the term of active filters will cover a much wider sense than that of active filters in the 1970s did. The function of active filters will be expanded from voltage flicker compensation or voltage regulation into power quality improvement for power distribution systems as the capacity of active filters becomes larger.

One key to overcoming this bottleneck is improving the performance of multiprocessor file systems. The design of a high-performance multiprocessor file system requires a comprehensive understanding of the expected workload. Unfortunately, until recently, no general workload studies of multiprocessor file systems have been conducted. The goal of the CHARISMA project was to remedy this problem by characterizing the behavior of several production workloads, on different machines, at the level of individual reads and writes. The first set of results from the CHARISMA project describe the workloads observed on an Intel iPSC/860 and a Thinking Machines CM-5. This paper is intended to compare and contrast these two workloads for an understanding of their essential similarities and differences, isolating common trends and platform-dependent variances. Using this comparison, we are able to gain more insight into the general principles that should guide multiprocessor file-system design.","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/11674/00539739.pdf","startPage":"1075","endPage":"1089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.539739","doi":"10.1109/71.539739","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539739","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["File systems","Application software","Concurrent computing","Computer Society","Performance gain","Production","Student members","System performance","Scientific computing","Supercomputers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","performance evaluation","file organisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file-access characteristics","parallel scientific workloads","computational performance","multiprocessors","multiprocessor file systems","CHARISMA project","Intel iPSC/860","Thinking Machines CM-5"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"File-access characteristics of parallel scientific workloads","accessionNumber":"5416292","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","volume":"7","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"File-access characteristics of parallel scientific workloads","sourcePdf":"00539739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063071S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"99","articleId":"539739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":539740,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

This problem arises in diverse contexts such as parallelizing compilers, parallel performance monitoring, and parallel algorithm development. In this paper, we describe one solution where one directly executes the application code, but uses a discrete-event simulator to model details of the presumed parallel machine, such as operating system and communication network behavior. Because this approach is computationally expensive, we are interested in its own parallelization, specifically the parallelization of the discrete-event simulator. We describe methods suitable for parallelized direct execution simulation of message-passing parallel programs, and report on the performance of such a system, LAPSE (Large Application Parallel Simulation Environment), we have built on the Intel Paragon. On all codes measured to date, LAPSE predicts performance well, typically within 10% relative error. Depending on the nature of the application code, we have observed low slowdowns (relative to natively executing code) and high relative speedups using up to 64 processors.","doi":"10.1109/71.539740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.539740","endPage":"1105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/11674/00539740.pdf","startPage":"1090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallelized direct execution simulation of message-passing parallel programs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539740/","displayDocTitle":"Parallelized direct execution simulation of message-passing parallel programs","volume":"7","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"5416293","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallelized direct execution simulation of message-passing parallel programs","sourcePdf":"00539740.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071255S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"32","articleId":"539740","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":539759,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The receiver is composed of a simple quadrature demodulator, followed by a symbol-rate sampler and a Viterbi decoder matched to the code trellis. The first modulation is a quaternary CPM scheme whose phase transitions over a symbol interval are those of /spl pi//4-shift quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK). The demodulator filter is optimized so as to minimize the combined effect of intersymbol interference (ISI) and noise at the decision instants. We use Wei's (1987) 16-state 4-D trellis code, and redefine the set partitioning tree so as to maintain the same minimum distance between parallel transitions as in quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal sets. The resulting modulation outperforms minimum-shift keying (MSK) by as much as 3.5 dB, in addition to reducing the 30-dB signal bandwidth by 20%. Next, we introduce an octonary (8-level) CPM scheme whose phase transitions are those of /spl pi//8-shift 8PSK. The same trellis code and receive filter optimization are also applied to this modulation which is shown to achieve better error rate performance than MSK, while saving some 60% of the transmitted signal bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/26.539770","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11672/00539770.pdf","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.539770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis-coded constant-envelope modulations with linear receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539770/","displayDocTitle":"Trellis-coded constant-envelope modulations with linear receivers","volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5421258","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis-coded constant-envelope modulations with linear receivers","sourcePdf":"00539770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04293S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","articleId":"539770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":539771,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

Previous work on interference cancellation has relied heavily on simulation techniques or a simple Gaussian approximation (GA). The standard GA ran lead to bit-error rate (BER) results which are optimistic for the conventional receiver, and this also occurs when the approximation is applied to the interference cancellation problem. Additionally, this approximation does not allow the second order effects of the multiple access interference (MAI) to be included in the performance estimates. Several improvements on the standard GA have been suggested which result in accurate performance results for a standard CDMA receiver. This paper presents an analytical expression for the probability of bit error for an adaptive multistage interference canceller, using an improved Gaussian approximation (IGA) for MAI. The BER at any stage of interference cancellation can be recursively computed from the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the statistics of the random powers of users, and the processing gain of the CDMA system. The performance of the resulting EER expression is compared with simulation results. Since the second order effects of MAI can be included, the analytical framework presented here can also be used to evaluate the performance of multistage interference cancellation in arbitrary fading environments, and we present results for the performance of interference cancellation in lognormal fading environments.","doi":"10.1109/26.539771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.539771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/11672/00539771.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of adaptive multistage interference cancellation for CDMA using an improved Gaussian approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of adaptive multistage interference cancellation for CDMA using an improved Gaussian approximation","volume":"44","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5421259","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of adaptive multistage interference cancellation for CDMA using an improved Gaussian approximation","sourcePdf":"00539771.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055716S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"79","articleId":"539771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":539773,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Pan","affiliation":["EIMC Unit, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK"],"lastName":"Qi Pan","id":"37349737100"},{"name":"R.J.

Based on this knowledge, a new expression for the probability density function (PDF) of the clipping noise at the output of a QAM demodulation matched filter is given which can be numerically evaluated with high accuracy. The bit-error rate (BER) performance prediction is then carried out for M-QAM signals within the hybrid system in the presence of an additive mixture of Gaussian and clipping impulse noise.

In the presence of multipath, however, each signal is subject to frequency-selective fading and the orthogonality condition does not necessarily hold leading to increased cross correlation. In these scenarios, multiuser detection need to be performed to suppress interference and recover the message symbols. To implement such a technique, explicit knowledge of the (nonorthogonal) signature waveforms of all users is required. We propose a blind estimation scheme that provides closed-form estimates of the signature waveforms by exploiting the structure information of the data output. In particular, we show that the subspace of the data matrix contains sufficient information for unique determination of the signature waveforms. Based on this observation, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC)-like algorithm is derived.

First, the structure of the ideal noise whitening filter is determined. The ideal noise whitening filter for a time-varying CDMA system is dependent on unknown future system parameters and is, therefore, impractical. A near ideal, realizable whitening filter is introduced as a solution. The convergence of the factorization method for a time-varying CDMA system is considered. The truncation of the number of taps of the ideal noise whitening filter is studied and a metric function based on the near ideal noise whitening filter for a tree search detection algorithm is formulated. Simulation results are obtained for five and ten-user time-varying CDMA systems with binary random signature sequences of length 10 and a rectangular chip waveform. The results show that the near ideal noise whitening filter can accurately approximate the ideal noise whitening filter at a low complexity level.

The architecture relies on the principle that only a few LSBs of an oversampled PCM digital signal need to be noise shaped in order to attain substantially the same performance as with an ordinary single stage or multistage architecture.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise shaping","Multi-stage noise shaping","Quantization","Feeds","Noise cancellation","Phase change materials","Pulse width modulation","Filters","Finite wordlength effects","Digital modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital-analogue conversion","noise","errors","pulse code modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimal multibit architecture","digital noise shaping architecture","noise-shaping DAC","D/A conversion","error cancellation","oversampled PCM digital signal"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1996.539794","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems.

The CMRR degradation in a low voltage opamp is due to the significant increase in both systematic and mismatching common mode gains which are, in turn, due to the tail current switching between the N and P pairs. Small signal analysis revealed that both systematic common mode gain and mismatching common mode gain are proportional to the rate of change of the tail current source of the input differential pairs. It is concluded that the systematic CMRR degradation could be overcome by topology modification but the mismatching remains to be the dominant factor which limits the improvement of CMRR in low voltage opamp with N-P differential pairs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 May 1996","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5399319","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The limitation of CMRR in low voltage operational amplifier with N-P input pairs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The limitation of CMRR in low voltage operational amplifier with N-P input pairs","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00539837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047671S","chronDate":"15-15 May 1996","isNumber":"11195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3834","citationCount":"2","articleId":"539837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":539838,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

A cascode type gain stage is used to provide most of the available gain. PTAT and bandgap type references are used to stabilize the gain against changes in operating conditions. Thus, the maximum simulated differential gain of 18 dB varies less than 1 dB over temperature range from -10/spl deg/C to 85/spl deg/C. The circuit has a simulated bandwidth of over 1 GHz and 2 dBm output -1 dB compression power with expected gain adjustment range of 50 dB.

The switched-current DAC is found to be relatively simple and capable of high-speed operation. The switched-capacitor circuit is more complex and likely to be somewhat slower, but it is nonetheless robust and provides a simple interface. A dynamic range of 110 dB with a third-order 17-level DAC is expected, even if the DAC elements suffer from 1% mismatch.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539872/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 May 1996","volume":"1","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5399334","publicationDate":"1996","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1996","displayDocTitle":"Multi-bit DAC with noise-shaped element mismatch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-bit DAC with noise-shaped element mismatch","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00539872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048552S","chronDate":"15-15 May 1996","isNumber":"11195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3834","citationCount":"10","articleId":"539872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":539876,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The photocell elements transform the light into current, and then, in a continuous way, into voltage without charge integration. This kind of sensing cell has been already employed in image sensors for normal cameras, but never in foveated sensors. The presented sensor tries to emulate the human eye pixel resulting in a sensor with a space variant distribution of pixels. Consequences of this distribution are the different size of the sensing elements in the pixel matrix, the non orthogonal shapes of the different elements that integrate the pixel, and, as a result, the different response of every cell in the sensor. A scaling mechanism is needed due to the different pixel size from circumference to circumference. A mechanism for current scaling is presented. This mechanism has been studied along with other effects, as the narrow channel effect on submicron MOS transistors, and the influence of the logarithmic response of these special kinds of sensing cells. The chip has been fabricated using standard 0.7 /spl mu/m CMOS technology.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1996.539907","publicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1996 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/3834/11195/00539907.pdf","startPage":"373","endPage":"376 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1996.539907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Response properties of a foveated space-variant CMOS image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 May 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539907/","displayDocTitle":"Response properties of a foveated space-variant CMOS image sensor","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1996","accessionNumber":"5405849","conferenceDate":"15-15 May 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Response properties of a foveated space-variant CMOS image sensor","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00539907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045194S","chronDate":"15-15 May 1996","isNumber":"11195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3834","citationCount":"10","articleId":"539907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":539933,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This technique does not allow an efficient heating of all the gland particularly in the case of large adenoma or when the treatment is limited to only one heating session. A solution to this problem is given by using simultaneously the rectal and urethral applicators. A complete 915-MHz microwave thermotherapy system is presented with two applicators which can operate independently or simultaneously to deliver the microwave energy in the prostate. Electromagnetic and thermal modeling have been developed for the applicator antenna optimization, to calculate the specific absorption rate (SAR) and the thermal pattern in the prostate for each applicator alone and when they operate together in phase. Different canine experiments have been performed to prove the interest of using the two applicators simultaneously as compared when they operate alone. Histological examination cuts of the prostate gland after heating have been carried out.","doi":"10.1109/22.539933","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/11668/00539933.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.539933","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"1762","endPage":"1768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microwave prostatic hyperthermia: interest of urethral and rectal applicators combination-theoretical study and animal experimental results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Microwave prostatic hyperthermia: interest of urethral and rectal applicators combination-theoretical study and animal experimental results","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539933/","volume":"44","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5414626","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microwave prostatic hyperthermia: interest of urethral and rectal applicators combination-theoretical study and animal experimental results","sourcePdf":"00539933.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042149S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"31","articleId":"539933","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":539934,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An analytic prediction of the optimum volume field distribution in a layered concentric head model based on summing spherical harmonic modes is derived and presented. This ideal distribution is then verified using a three-dimensional finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation with a discretized, MRI-based head model excited by the spherical source. The numerical computation gives a very similar dissipated power pattern as the analytic prediction. This study demonstrates that microwave hyperthermia can theoretically be a feasible cancer treatment modality for tumors in the head, providing a well-resolved \"hot-spot\" at depth without overheating any other healthy tissue.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/11668/00539934.pdf","startPage":"1769","endPage":"1777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.539934","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.539934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD verification of deep-set brain tumor hyperthermia using a spherical microwave source distribution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Neoplasms","Hyperthermia","Cancer","Humans","Surface treatment","Microwave generation","Power generation","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","brain","hyperthermia","microwave heating","radiation therapy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep-set brain tumor hyperthermia","hyperthermia verification","spherical microwave source distribution","therapeutic heating","tightly focused global power density maximum","analytic prediction","optimum volume field distribution","layered concentric head model","spherical harmonic modes summing","discretized MRI-based head model","human body structures","feasible cancer treatment modality","head tumors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539934/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"FDTD verification of deep-set brain tumor hyperthermia using a spherical microwave source distribution","volume":"44","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5414627","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD verification of deep-set brain tumor hyperthermia using a spherical microwave source distribution","sourcePdf":"00539934.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034694S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","articleId":"539934","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":539939,"authors":[{"name":"J.-C.

This interaction as well as the resultant deposition of microwave power in the body (specific absorption rate-SAR) are of particular interest for cellular telephones and similar communication devices. This paper builds on and extends the previous analyses of parameters that influence the antenna-user interaction. Computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived, high-resolution models of the human head are used. The numerical analysis is performed with the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The specific findings are: 1) a box model of a human head provides grossly distorted and unreliable results for the antenna radiation pattern; 2) a spherical model of the human head provides results that are relatively close to those obtained with a relatively simple, but more realistic, head model; 3) the SAR values obtained with spherical or simplified head models, that do not include the ear, are greater than those for a realistic head model that includes the ear; and 4) a hand holding the handset absorbs significant amount of antenna output power, which can be considerably decreased by modifying the geometry of the handset metal box.","doi":"10.1109/22.539944","startPage":"1855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/11668/00539944.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.539944","endPage":"1864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of the handset antenna and human body interaction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"A study of the handset antenna and human body interaction","volume":"44","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5414637","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of the handset antenna and human body interaction","sourcePdf":"00539944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044636S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"303","articleId":"539944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":539945,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Different numerical head phantoms based on MRI scans of 3 different adults were used with voxel sizes down to 1 mm/sup 3/. Simulations of the absorption were performed by distinguishing the electrical properties of up to 13 tissue types. In addition simulations with modified electric parameters and reduced degrees of complexity were performed. Thus, the phantoms greatly differ from each other in terms of shape, size, and internal anatomy. The numerical results are compared with those of measurements in a multitissue phantom and 2 homogeneous phantoms of different shapes and sizes. The results demonstrate that size and shape are of minor importance, Although local SAR values depend significantly on local inhomogeneities and electric properties, the volume-averaged spatial peak SAR obtained with the homogeneous phantoms only slightly overestimates that of the worst-case exposure in the inhomogeneous phantoms.","doi":"10.1109/22.539945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/11668/00539945.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.539945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11668","startPage":"1865","endPage":"1873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The dependence of EM energy absorption upon human head modeling at 900 MHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The dependence of EM energy absorption upon human head modeling at 900 MHz","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5414638","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The dependence of EM energy absorption upon human head modeling at 900 MHz","sourcePdf":"00539945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038484S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"144","articleId":"539945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":539946,"authors":[{"name":"S.-I.

The difference between the SAR distributions produced by a 1/4-wavelength monopole antenna and those produced by a 1/2-wavelength dipole antenna is investigated. The dependence of the maximum local SAR on the distance d/sub a/ between the auricle of the head and the antenna of the radio is evaluated. It is shown that the maximum local SAR decreases as the antenna length extends from 1/4 to 1/2 of the wavelength. The maximum local SAR's in a head model with auricles are larger than these in one without auricles. The dependence of the SAR on the electrical inhomogeneity of the tissues in the head model is not significant with regard to the surface distribution and the maximum local SAR when the radio is near the head. It is also shown that the maximum local SAR is not strongly dependent on the position of the hand when the hand does not shade the antenna.

Assuming reduced dimensions characteristic of today's mobile telephones, the authors have obtained SAR distributions for two different lengths of monopole antennas of lengths /spl lambda//4 and 3/spl lambda//8 for a model of the adult male and reduced-scale models of 10- and 5-year-old children and find that peak one-voxel and 1-g SARs are larger for the smaller models of children, particularly at 835 MHz. Also, a larger in-depth penetration of absorbed energy for these smaller models is obtained. The authors have also studied the effect of using the widely disparate tissue properties reported in the literature and of using homogeneous instead of the anatomically realistic heterogeneous models on the SAR distributions. Homogeneous models are shown to grossly overestimate both the peak 1-voxel and 1-g SARs. Last, the authors show that it is possible to use truncated one-half or one-third models of the human head with negligible errors in the calculated SAR distributions. This simplification will allow considerable savings in computer memory and computation times.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic absorption in the human head and neck for mobile telephones at 835 and 1900 MHz","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.539947","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/11668/00539947.pdf","startPage":"1884","endPage":"1897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.539947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=11668","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=539947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/539947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1996","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic absorption in the human head and neck for mobile telephones at 835 and 1900 MHz","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","accessionNumber":"5414640","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic absorption in the human head and neck for mobile telephones at 835 and 1900 MHz","sourcePdf":"00539947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043498S","chronDate":"Oct 1996","isNumber":"11668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"378","articleId":"539947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":539949,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method requires the numerical computation of the Green's function for an unperturbed model of the body in order to apply reconstruction techniques to a reduced investigation domain, which can be changed inside the body, with a reduction in on-line computation.

The simulated performances prove that it is possible to achieve an high input to supply ratio without a considerable amount of biasing current. Unlike almost all other designs of four quadrant multiplier in literature, this circuit allows a very low power dissipation (6 /spl mu/W for cell) using both low biasing current (4 /spl mu/A) and a 1.5 V supply. These properties make this circuit very suitable for ANN applications as a precise weighting synapse and for low power analog signal processing for portable applications.

The digital correction compensates for incomplete cancellation of quantization noise from individual delta-sigma stages, and for gain and spectral distortion of the signal transfer function. Simulation results demonstrate that a simple off-line calibration method is effective to achieve neat-perfect digital correction of analog sources of error and spectral distortion.
