Mathematical and numerical modelling is applied to the coupled process of the pressurized fluid flow through the bearing, with a Navier slip condition replacing a no-slip condition, and the axial motion of the rotor and stator. The derived modified Reynolds equation is coupled with the dynamic motion of the stator through the pressure exerted by the fluid film, with explicit analytical expressions for the pressure and force determined and the equation for the bearing gap reduced to a non-linear second-order non-autonomous ordinary differential equation. A mapping solver is used to investigate the time-dependent bearing gap for prescribed periodic motion of the rotor.

Detailed description of adsorption kinetics is abrogated by a simple ansatz directly relating interfacial tension and bulk solute concentration. Consequently, the formal mathematical treatment and some of the results share features in common with the Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard\u2013Marangoni thermocapillary problem. Normal mode perturbation analysis in the limit of small interface deformations establishes the existence of an unstable response for low wavenumber excitation. In the classification of Cross & Hohenberg (1993, Pattern formation outside of equilibrium. Rev. Mod. Phys., 65, 851\u20131112), both type I and type II behaviour are observed. By considering the zero wavenumber situation exactly, it is proved that all eigenvalues are purely imaginary with non-positive imaginary part; hence, a type III instability is not possible. For characteristic timescales of mass diffusion much shorter than the relaxation time of interfacial fluctuations (infinite crispation number): the response growth rate is obtained explicitly; only a single excitation mode is available, and a complete stability diagram is constructed in terms of the relevant control parameters. Otherwise, from a quiescent base state, an infinite discrete spectrum of modes is observed that exhibit avoided crossing and switching phenomena, as well as exceptional points where stationary state pairs coalesce into a single oscillatory standing wave pattern. A base state plane Poiseuille flow, driven by an external pressure gradient, generally exaggerates the response: growth rates of instabilities are enhanced, and stable decay is further suppressed with increasing base flow speed, but the inherent symmetry breaking destroys stationary and standing wave response. Results are obtained in this most general situation by implementing a numerical Chebyshev collocation scheme. The model was motivated by hydrodynamic processes supposed to be involved in gastric digestion of humans.","doi":"10.1093/imamat/hxv009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/imamat/hxv009","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1618","publicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics","displayPublicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Applied Mathematics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016796/8180165/08180181.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8180165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incipient mixing by Marangoni effects in slow viscous flow of two immiscible fluid layers","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8180181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Incipient mixing by Marangoni effects in slow viscous flow of two immiscible fluid layers","volume":"80","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Incipient mixing by Marangoni effects in slow viscous flow of two immiscible fluid layers","sourcePdf":"hxv009.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039844S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","isNumber":"8180165","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016796","articleId":"8180181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8180195,"authors":[{"name":"Fioralba Cakoni","firstName":"Fioralba","lastName":"Cakoni"},{"name":"Nicolas Chaulet","firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Chaulet"},{"name":"Houssem Haddar","firstName":"Houssem","lastName":"Haddar"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-4960"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1464-3634"}],"articleNumber":"8180195","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":436},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8180195","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transmission eigenvalues","thin layers","asymptotic methods","inverse scattering"]}],"abstract":"We consider the transmission eigenvalue problem for an impenetrable obstacle with Dirichlet boundary condition surrounded by a thin layer of non-absorbing inhomogeneous material.

The average spectrum shows strong double-peaked helium emission lines, as well as a variety of metal lines, including neon; this is the second detection of neon in an AM CVn binary, after the much brighter system GP Com. We detect no calcium in the accretion disc, a puzzling feature that has been noted in many of the longer period AM CVn binaries. We measure an orbital period, from the radial velocities of the emission lines, of 35.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u2009min, confirming the ultracompact binary nature of the system. The emission lines seen in SDSS\u00a0J1730 are very narrow, although double-peaked, implying a low-inclination, face-on accretion disc; using the measured velocities of the line peaks, we estimate i\u2009\u2264 11\u00b0.

Over 25 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020. Because of exponentially increasing number of connected devices, we have Internet of Things (IoT) enabled applications that offer socioeconomic benefits. Different IoT applications have different operational requirements and constraints. For instance, IoT enabled transportation cyber-physical system needs lowest latency and high data rate, IoT enabled financial systems or banks need high security to support mobile banking, IoT enabled manufacturing systems need high resiliency to combat fault tolerance and cyber-attacks, IoT enabled cyber-physical power system needs the least latency and highest resiliency to avoid power outage caused by faults or cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose wireless network virtualization to create different virtual wireless networks (VWNs) through mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to support different IoT enabled systems with diverse requirements and resiliency. Wireless virtualization is regarded as an emerging paradigm to enhance RF spectrum utilization, provide better coverage, increase network capacity, enhance energy efficiency and provide security. In order to prevent double-spending (allocating same frequency to multiple network providers) of wireless resources, we have proposed to use blockchain based approach which provides quality-of-service to users. Furthermore, IoT is expected to generate massive amount of data (aka big data), we consider edge computing to process big data when individual devices have limited computing/processing and storage capabilities. Moreover, network segmentation through VWNs provides the security and enhances the network performance. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical results obtained from simulation.","doi":"10.1109/CIC.2017.00030","startPage":"155","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170182/8181461/08181491.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2017.00030","endPage":"162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8181461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge Computing Enabled Resilient Wireless Network Virtualization for Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8181491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Edge Computing Enabled Resilient Wireless Network Virtualization for Internet of Things","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8181491/","accessionNumber":"17431178","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Oct 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge Computing Enabled Resilient Wireless Network Virtualization for Internet of Things","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"256501a155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086567S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170182","isNumber":"8181461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170182","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8181461","articleId":"8181491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8181492,"authors":[{"name":"Tasnia Heya Ashrafi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, BRAC University 66, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Tasnia Heya","lastName":"Ashrafi","id":"37086321008"},{"name":"Md.

Cloud computing is a centralized Internet based computing model which acts like a storage as well as a network connection bridge between end devices and servers. Cloud computing has been ruling as a data computation model for quite a while but if we try to concentrate on the upcoming IoT generation, the vision will become a little bit blurry as it is not possible for the present cloud computing models to deal with such huge amount of data and to rescue from this foggy situation, Fog computing model comes forward. Instead of being a replacement of the cloud computing model, Fog computing model is an extension of Cloud which works as a distributed decentralized computing infrastructure in which data compute, storage and applications are distributed in the most logical, efficient place between the data source and the cloud. In this paper, we proposed an infrastructure with collaboration of Fog computing combined with Machine-to-Machine(M2M) intelligent communication protocol followed by integration of the Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) and this model will be able to transfer data by analyzing reliably and systematically with low latency, less bandwidth, heterogeneity in less amount of time maintaining the Quality of Service(QoS) befittingly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170182/8181461/08181492.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"172","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","doi":"10.1109/CIC.2017.00031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2017.00031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8181461","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8181492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service Based FOG Computing Model for IoT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Edge computing","Data models","Service-oriented architecture","Peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Internet of Things","protocols","quality of service","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT devices","data access","efficient data computation infrastructures","logical data computation infrastructures","centralized Internet based computing model","servers","data computation model","cloud computing model","distributed decentralized computing infrastructure","data source","service based FOG computing model","IoT generation","fog computing model","machine-to-machine intelligent communication protocol","M2M intelligent communication protocol","service oriented architecture","SOA","Quality of Service","QoS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things (IoT)","Fog Computing","M2M Communication","Service Oriented Architecture(SOA)","Agent based SOA","Quality of Service (QoS)","Heterogeneous devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8181492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Service Based FOG Computing Model for IoT","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8181492/","publicationDate":"Oct 2017","accessionNumber":"17431191","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service Based FOG Computing Model for IoT","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"256501a163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063577S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170182","isNumber":"8181461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170182","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8181461","articleId":"8181492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8181502,"authors":[{"name":"Zachariah Pabi Gariba","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of South Africa, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Zachariah Pabi","lastName":"Gariba","id":"37085418643"},{"name":"John Andrew Van Der Poll","affiliation":["Graduate School of Business Leadership, University of South Africa, Midrand, South africa"],"firstName":"John Andrew","lastName":"Van Der Poll","id":"37085390060"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2565-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2566-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8181502","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Authentication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corporate resources","service provider","security challenges","security vulnerabilities","security failure trends","cloud computing technology","Information Communication Technology usage","information technology services","hardware resources","technological maintenance","third-party cloud service providers","security threats","cloud computing services","external administrative jurisdiction","cloud security framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Formal methods","Information security","Trust","Privacy","Cloud security modelling"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing technology is causing a shift in Information Communication Technology usage by transforming the approaches businesses employ information technology services. This benefits computing usage by allowing users to share hardware resources via multiplexing of virtual machines which are the basic units of cloud computing. Small and new businesses which often lack good financial standing but desire to use the cloud, need not own these resources, but only pay for their use at a reduced price. This alleviates the cost of technological maintenance and operation. However, the services provided by third-party cloud service providers involve inherent security threats. The relocation of corporate resources to an external administrative jurisdiction escalates security concerns such as trust, assurance and transparency. There may be devastating effects to clients, should their financial transactions and corporate information be compromised as a result of a service provider's security challenges. This research employs a quantitative case study to analyse the security challenges of popular cloud computing services existing within the past four years. An overview of security vulnerabilities in cloud computing is presented; a preliminary cloud security framework is developed and the role of computing formalisms is investigated.","doi":"10.1109/CIC.2017.00041","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170182/8181461/08181502.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2017.00041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8181461","startPage":"247","endPage":"256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security Failure Trends of Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8181502","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Security Failure Trends of Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8181502/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct 2017","accessionNumber":"17431167","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8181502/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security Failure Trends of Cloud Computing","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"256501a247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109753S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170182","isNumber":"8181461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170182","xplore-issue":"8181461","articleId":"8181502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8181504,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Salimitari","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science University of Central Florida Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Salimitari","id":"37086303185"},{"name":"Mainak Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science University of Central Florida Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Mainak","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37085428026"},{"name":"Murat Yuksel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science University of Central Florida Orlando, FL"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Yuksel","id":"37086300658"},{"name":"Eduardo Pasiliao","affiliation":["Munitions Directorate Air Force Research Laboratory Eglin AFB, FL"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Pasiliao","id":"37086295593"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2565-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2566-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8181504","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":746},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Collaboration","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data mining","electronic money","financial data processing","profitability","transaction processing","utility theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["utility value","electricity fee","pool fee","F2Pool","Bitcoin Pool mining","cryptocurrency","solo mining","profit maximization","Bitcoin value","pool profitability","AntPool","cryptocurrencies","prospect theory","hash rate power","reward distribution policy","BTC.com","Slushl'ool","BatPool","Antminer 55","utility theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bitcoin mining","pools","prospect theory","utility"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8181504","abstract":"It is predicted that cryptocurrencies will play an important role in the global economy. Therefore, it is prudent for us to understand the importance and monetary value of such cryptocurrencies, and strategize our investments accordingly. One of the ways to obtain cryptocurrency is via mining. As solo mining is not possible because of the computational requirements, pool mining has gained popularity. In this paper, we focus on Bitcoin and its pools. With more than 20 pools in the network of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it becomes challenging for a new miner to decide the pool he must join such that the profit is maximized. We use prospect theory to predict the profit that a specific miner, given his hash rate power and electricity costs, is expected to make from each pool. A utility value is calculated for each pool based on its recent performance, hash rate power, total number of the pool members, reward distribution policy of the pool, electricity fee in the new miner's region, pool fee, and the current Bitcoin value. Then, based on these parameters during a certain time duration, the most profitable pool is found for that miner. We show how the utility values from a pool varies with electricity fee and dollar equivalent of a Bitcoin. To find the accuracy of our predictions, we mine Bitcoin by joining 5 different pools- AntPool, F2Pool, BTC.com, Slushl'ool, and BatPool. Using an Antminer 55 for each pool, we mine Bitcoin for 40 consecutive days. Results reveal that our prospect theoretic predictions are consistent with what we actually mine; however predictions using expected utility theory are not as close.","doi":"10.1109/CIC.2017.00043","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8170182/8181461/08181504.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.2017.00043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8181461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Profit Maximization for Bitcoin Pool Mining: A Prospect Theoretic Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Profit Maximization for Bitcoin Pool Mining: A Prospect Theoretic Approach","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17431169","publicationDate":"Oct 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8181504/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8181504/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","conferenceDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Profit Maximization for Bitcoin Pool Mining: A Prospect Theoretic Approach","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"256501a267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050889S","chronDate":"15-17 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8170182","isNumber":"8181461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8170182","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8181461","articleId":"8181504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8181505,"authors":[{"name":"Da-Yin Liao","affiliation":["Straight & Up Intelligent Innovations Group Co, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Da-Yin","lastName":"Liao","id":"37086272058"},{"name":"Xuehong Wang","affiliation":["Center of Lottery Studies in China, Pking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuehong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086269736"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2565-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2566-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8181505","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1220},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8181505","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Contracts","Smart cities","Bitcoin","Games","Peer-to-peer computing","Privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contracts","cryptography","data privacy","electronic money","public administration","smart cities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparency","lottery games","emerging blockchain technology","lottery industries","blockchain-based lottery system","smart contracts","cryptograph blockchain model","smart cities applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["smart cities","blockchain","lottery","gaming","smart contract","decentralization"]}],"abstract":"Among the smart cities applications, optimizing lottery games is one of the urgent needs to ensure their fairness and transparency.

Based on our method, we classify 342 BCUs as BL Lacs and 154 as flat-spectrum radio quasars, while 77 objects remain uncertain. Moreover, radio analysis and direct observations in ground-based optical observatories are used as counterparts to the statistical classifications to validate the method.

More specifically, using a bag-of-words representation of the frequent Flickr image tags, a sparsity-constrained subspace algorithm discovers a compact set of textual attributes (i.e., each textual attribute is a sparse and linear representation of those frequent image tags) for each Flickr image. Then, a weakly supervised learning algorithm projects the textual attributes at image-level to the highly-responsive image patches. These patches indicate where humans look at appealing regions with respect to each textual attribute, which are employed to learn the visual attributes. Psychological and anatomical studies have demonstrated that humans perceive visual concepts in a hierarchical way. Therefore, we normalize these patches and further feed them into a five-layer convolutional neural network to mimic the hierarchy of human perceiving the visual attributes. We apply the learned deep features onto applications like image retargeting, aesthetics ranking, and retrieval.

However, in multiuser scenario, a challenging physical layer security issue arises as the confident messages sent to the intended information receivers may be eavesdropped by other receivers. To address this problem, in this paper, secrecy energy efficiency maximization (SEEM) problem is investigated for two-user orthogonal frequency-division multiple access networks with SWIPT. Specifically, a power splitting scheme is adopted for each user, which would split received radio frequency signals into two independent parts for information decoding and energy harvesting, respectively. Taking both the individual secrecy quality of service requirement and the individual harvested energy constraint into consideration, the SEEM problem is formulated as a nonlinear fractional programming problem. Moreover, according to Dinkelbach's method, a power allocation and power splitting (PAPS) algorithm is proposed by solving the equivalent convex optimization problem. Finally, numerical results verify the impact of static circuit power consumption, maximum transmit power, power split ratio, subcarrier bandwidth, and path loss on secrecy energy efficiency of our PAPS algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8649702/08183429.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2017.2775607","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2017.2775607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8649702","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8183429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Energy Efficiency Optimization for Downlink Two-User OFDMA Networks With SWIPT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Physical layer","Network security","Receivers","Energy harvesting","Wireless communication","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","convex programming","energy conservation","energy harvesting","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","telecommunication security","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum transmit power","power split ratio","secrecy energy efficiency optimization","downlink two-user OFDMA networks","SWIPT","power transfer","information decoding","energy harvesting","intended information receivers","secrecy energy efficiency maximization problem","two-user orthogonal frequency-division multiple access networks","radio frequency signals","individual secrecy quality","individual harvested energy constraint","SEEM problem","nonlinear fractional programming problem","power allocation","power splitting algorithm","equivalent convex optimization problem","static circuit power consumption","physical layer security issue"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear fractional programming","physical layer security","secrecy energy efficiency (SEE)","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems","weighted secrecy rate sum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8183429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Energy Efficiency Optimization for Downlink Two-User OFDMA Networks With SWIPT","volume":"13","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8183429/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18471224","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XDJK2016A011, XDJK2015C010, XDJK2015D023, XDJK2016D047 and XDJK201710635069"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402381, 61503309, 61772432 and 61772433"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Key Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2015jcyjBX0094"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Energy Efficiency Optimization for Downlink Two-User OFDMA Networks With SWIPT","sourcePdf":"jsyst-guo-2775607-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126788S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8649702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8649702","articleId":"8183429","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8183432,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Chongqing Jiaotong University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/8869950/8183432/chen-2776940-small.gif","p":["Xiaofeng Chen was born in 1980.

Different from designing controllers using the time-triggering mechanism, the event-triggered controller is updated only when the system state deviates more than a certain threshold from a prescribed value. To obtain the event-triggered optimal controller, we develop an identifier-critic architecture under the framework of reinforcement learning. The identifier network, composed of a feedforward neural network (FNN), aims to derive the knowledge of unknown system dynamics, and the critic network, constituted of an FNN, intends to derive the event-triggered optimal controller. The identifier network is tuned via the combination of a standard back-propagation algorithm and an e-modification method, and the critic network is updated using a modification of the gradient descent method. By introducing an additional stability term to update the critic network, the initial admissible control is no longer required. Meanwhile, by using historical and instantaneous state data together, the persistence of excitation condition is relaxed. A stability analysis of the closed-loop system is provided based on the Lyapunov method. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is illustrated through simulations of a nonlinear example and a single link robot arm system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-Triggered Optimal Neuro-Controller Design With Reinforcement Learning for Unknown Nonlinear Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2017.2774602","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8804278/08183439.pdf","startPage":"1866","endPage":"1878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2017.2774602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8804278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8183439","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6221021/8804278/8183439-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8183439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Event-Triggered Optimal Neuro-Controller Design With Reinforcement Learning for Unknown Nonlinear Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8183439/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2019","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18905971","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51529701, 61503379 and 61533017"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI 1526835"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Event-Triggered Optimal Neuro-Controller Design With Reinforcement Learning for Unknown Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmc-he-2774602-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107761S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8804278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8804278","articleId":"8183439","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8183441,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Ban","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center for Geospatial Technology, School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8303578/8183441/ban-2768555-small.gif","p":["Wei Ban received the master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees in geomatics engineering from the School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2013 and 2017, respectively.","His research interests include global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning and navigation and GNSS reflectometry applications."]},"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Ban","orcid":"0000-0002-8918-797X","id":"37085360877"},{"name":"Kegen Yu","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center for Geospatial Technology, School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8303578/8183441/yu-2768555-small.gif","p":["Kegen Yu (SM\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia, in 2003.","He was with Jiangxi Geological and Mineral Bureau, Nanchang, China; Nanchang University, Nanchang; the University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland; the CSIRO ICT Center, Sydney; Macquarie University, Sydney; and the University of New South Wales, Sydney.

However, research on GNSS-R has mainly been focused on the global positioning system which consists of only medium earth orbit satellites, while the use of geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites, such as those in BeiDou navigation satellite system, has received little attention. This paper investigates the GEO-satellite-based GNSS-R with a focus on the application of soil moisture retrieval. Because GEO satellites remain static with the earth, the models of the reflected GNSS signals can be considerably simplified and their signals can be used to estimate soil moisture with a high update rate such as once per hour. Two new soil moisture estimation approaches using GEO signals are proposed, which are termed GEO interferometric reflectometry (GEO-IR) and GEO reflectometry (GEO-R). Two theoretical models (linear and second order) are developed for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based GEO-IR as well as for phase-based GEO-IR. Meanwhile, two empirical models (linear and second order) are developed for signal amplitude-based GEO-R as well as for SNR ratio-based GEO-R. Experimental data sets collected from three different geographical regions were used to evaluate the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed GEO-IR and GEO-R are able to monitor soil moisture reliably under bare soil condition, augmenting GNSS-R through significantly reduced processing complexity and increased temporal coverage.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8303578/08183441.pdf","startPage":"1829","endPage":"1838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2768555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2768555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8303578","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8183441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GEO-Satellite-Based Reflectometry for Soil Moisture Estimation: Signal Modeling and Algorithm Development","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Soil moisture","Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Signal to noise ratio","Global Positioning System","Estimation","Earth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical signal processing","Global Positioning System","hydrology","moisture","reflectometry","remote sensing","soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal modeling","global navigation satellite system reflectometry","GNSS-R","global positioning system","geostationary earth orbit satellites","BeiDou navigation satellite system","soil moisture retrieval","reflected GNSS signals","soil moisture estimation approaches","GEO signals","GEO interferometric reflectometry","signal-to-noise ratio","GEO-IR","remote sensing technique","GEO-satellite-based reflectometry","soil moisture monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS)","geostationary earth orbit (GEO) interferometry","GEO reflectometry (GEO-R)","GEO satellites","soil moisture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8183441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"GEO-Satellite-Based Reflectometry for Soil Moisture Estimation: Signal Modeling and Algorithm Development","volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8183441/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17582292","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 973 Project China","grantNumber":"2013CB733301"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41474025 and 41574031"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20130141110001"},{"fundingName":"Surveying and Mapping Foundation Research Fund Program"},{"fundingName":"National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation","grantNumber":"14-02-09"},{"fundingName":"Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Precise Engineering and Industry Surveying of National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation","grantNumber":"PF2015-5"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GEO-Satellite-Based Reflectometry for Soil Moisture Estimation: Signal Modeling and Algorithm Development","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2768555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106941S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8303578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8303578","articleId":"8183441","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8185561,"authors":[{"name":"C.

We consider stellar mass objects orbiting the massive black hole (MBH) found in the Galactic Centre (GC). EMRBs provide a novel means of extracting information about the MBH; an EMRB from the Galactic MBH could be highly informative regarding the MBH's mass and spin if the orbital periapsis is small enough. However, to be a useful astronomical tool, EMRBs must be both informative and sufficiently common to be detectable with a space-based interferometer. We construct a simple model to predict the event rate for Galactic EMRBs. We estimate that there could be on average \u223c2 bursts in a two-year mission lifetime for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. Stellar mass black holes dominate the event rate. Creating a sample of 100 mission realizations, we calculate what we could learn about the MBH. On average, we expect to be able to determine the MBH mass to \u223c1\u00a0per\u2009cent and the spin to \u223c0.1 using EMRBs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8185502","publicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","displayPublicationTitle":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016813/8185502/08185561.pdf","doi":"10.1093/mnras/stt1543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt1543","startPage":"3521","endPage":"3540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expectations for extreme-mass-ratio bursts from the Galactic Centre","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8185561/","displayDocTitle":"Expectations for extreme-mass-ratio bursts from the Galactic Centre","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"volume":"435","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Expectations for extreme-mass-ratio bursts from the Galactic Centre","sourcePdf":"stt1543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062823S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","isNumber":"8185502","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016813","articleId":"8185561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8186148,"authors":[{"name":"Hilal Tayara","affiliation":["Department of Information and Electronics Engineering, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8186148/tayar-2782260-small.gif","p":["Hilal Tayara received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Aleppo University, Aleppo, Syria, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in electronics and information engineering from Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, South Korea, in 2015.

It is important for a wide range of applications, such as urban planning and traffic management. However, this task is a challenging one due to the small size of the vehicles, their different types and orientations, and similarity in their visual appearance, and some other objects, such as air conditioning units on buildings, trash bins, and road marks. Many methods have been introduced in the literature for solving this problem. These methods are either based on shallow learning or deep learning approaches. However, these methods suffer from relatively low precision and recall rate. This paper introduces an automated vehicle detection and counting system in aerial images. The proposed system utilizes convolution neural network to regress a vehicle spatial density map across the aerial image. It has been evaluated on two publicly available data sets, namely, Munich and Overhead Imagery Research Data Set. The experimental results show that our proposed system is efficient and effective, and produces higher precision and recall rate than the comparative methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2782260","startPage":"2220","endPage":"2230","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08186148.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2782260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Detection and Counting in High-Resolution Aerial Images Using Convolutional Regression Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle detection","Feature extraction","Automobiles","Training","Sensors","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","object detection","object recognition","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning approaches","Munich","overhead imagery research data set","low precision","comparative methods","vehicle spatial density map","automated vehicle detection","recall rate","traffic management","urban planning","convolutional regression neural network","high-resolution aerial images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerial images","convolution neural network (CNN)","deep learning","regression","vehicle detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186148/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Detection and Counting in High-Resolution Aerial Images Using Convolutional Regression Neural Network","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8186148/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17573792","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"BK21 PLUS"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Brain Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2017M3C7A1044815"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003661","fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy and the Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology through the International Cooperative Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"N046200012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Vehicle Detection and Counting in High-Resolution Aerial Images Using Convolutional Regression Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-tayara-2782260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072703S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8186148","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8186160,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086336642"},{"name":"Jing Tian","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Tian","id":"37085738959"},{"name":"Khalid Z.

We show that the system displays a complex autonomous dynamics, induced by the competition between these two nonlinearities. In the case of small delay, the system displays harmonic and relaxation oscillations. When the delay is large, the interplay between the two nonlinearities leads to a period-doubling route of bifurcations as the feedback gain is increased, and ultimately to fully developed chaos.

The framework consists of two groups of localization algorithms, namely, beamforming-based and statistical model based localization algorithms. We first generalize our previously proposed methods based on beamforming techniques to the binaural configuration with 2 \u00d7 2 microphones. Next, we contribute two statistical model based methods for binaural localization using the maximum likelihood approach that also takes head-related transfer functions and unknown noise conditions into account. The methods enable the localization of multiple source positions for all azimuth angles and do not require prior training of binaural cues. The proposed localization algorithms are integrated into a generalized side-lobe canceller (GSC) to extract the desired speaker in the presence of competing speakers and background noise and when the head of the listener turns. The GSC components are adapted with the frequency-wise target presence probability and the frame-wise broadband direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimates that track the turns of the listener's head. We evaluate the performance of the localization algorithms individually and also in the context of the adaptive binaural beamformer in various noisy and reverberant conditions. Finally, we introduce a new adaptive beamformer, which combines the GSC with multichannel speech presence probability estimation and achieves superior source separation performance in noisy environment.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2017.2782491","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/8253682/08186189.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8253682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2017.2782491","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","startPage":"515","endPage":"528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binaural Speaker Localization Integrated Into an Adaptive Beamformer for Hearing Aids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Binaural Speaker Localization Integrated Into an Adaptive Beamformer for Hearing Aids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186189/","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8186189/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17485414","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Unions Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"FP7/2007-2013"},{"fundingName":"REA","grantNumber":"PITN-GA-2012-31752"},{"fundingName":"European Fund for Regional Development","grantNumber":"EFRE-0800372 (RaVis-3D)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binaural Speaker Localization Integrated Into an Adaptive Beamformer for Hearing Aids","sourcePdf":"taslp-zohourian-2782491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068637S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"8253682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8253682","articleId":"8186189","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8186190,"authors":[{"name":"Wanke Yu","affiliation":["College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8307303/8186190/yu-2782232-small.gif","p":["Wanke Yu received the B.Sc. degree from Northeastern University,\n Shenyang, China, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing,\n China, in 2016.

In this paper, a sparse exponential discriminant analysis (SEDA) algorithm is proposed for addressing those issues. The sparse discriminant model is developed by introducing the penalty of lasso or elastic net into the exponential discriminant analysis algorithm, so that the key variables responsible for the fault can be automatically selected. Since the formulated model is nonconvex, it is recast as an iterative convex optimization problem using the minorization-maximization algorithm. After that, a feasible gradient direction method is developed to solve the optimization problem effectively. The sparse solutions indicate the key faulty information to improve classification performance, and thus distinguish different faults more accurately. A simulation process and a real industrial process are used to test the performance of the proposed method, and the experimental results show that the SEDA algorithm can isolate the faulty variables and simplify the discriminant model by discarding variables with little significance.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2782232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8307303/08186190.pdf","startPage":"5931","endPage":"5940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2782232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Exponential Discriminant Analysis and Its Application to Fault Diagnosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186190/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Exponential Discriminant Analysis and Its Application to Fault Diagnosis","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17630219","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8186190/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422306 and 61433005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Exponential Discriminant Analysis and Its Application to Fault Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tie-yu-2782232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10456S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8307303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8307303","articleId":"8186190","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8186191,"authors":[{"name":"Guotao Xie","affiliation":["Department of Automotive Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China","State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8307303/8186191/xie-2782236-small.gif","p":["Guotao Xie received the bachelor's degree in automotive\n engineering from the Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2013, where he is currently working toward the\n Ph.D. degree with the Department of Automotive Engineering.","He is also a joint student of the State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy, Tsinghua University,\n Beijing, China.

In this study, an integrated vehicle trajectory prediction method is proposed by combining physics- and maneuver-based approaches. These two methods were combined for the reason that the physics-based trajectory prediction method could ensure accuracy in the short term with the consideration of vehicle running dynamic parameters, and the maneuver-based prediction approach has a long-term insight into future trajectories with maneuver estimation. In this study, the interactive multiple model trajectory prediction (IMMTP) method is proposed by combining the two predicting models. The probability of each model in the interactive multiple models could recursively adjust according to the predicting variance of each model. In addition, prediction uncertainty is considered by employing unscented Kalman filters in the physics-based prediction model. To the maneuver-based method, random elements for uncertainty are introduced to the trajectory of each maneuver inferred by using the dynamic Bayesian network. The approach is applied and analyzed in the lane-changing scenario by using naturalistic driving data. Comparison results indicate that IMMTP could achieve a more accurate prediction trajectory with a long prediction horizon.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Trajectory Prediction by Integrating Physics- and Maneuver-Based Approaches Using Interactive Multiple Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2782236","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8307303/08186191.pdf","startPage":"5999","endPage":"6008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2782236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186191","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Trajectory Prediction by Integrating Physics- and Maneuver-Based Approaches Using Interactive Multiple Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8186191/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17630177","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51475254 and 51625503"},{"fundingName":"Junior Fellowships for Advanced Innovation Think-tank Program of China Association for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"DXB-ZKQN-2017-035"},{"fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M620765"},{"fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingName":"joint research project of Tsinghua University and Daimler"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Trajectory Prediction by Integrating Physics- and Maneuver-Based Approaches Using Interactive Multiple Models","sourcePdf":"tie-xie-2782236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106655S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8307303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8307303","articleId":"8186191","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8186193,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Peng","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Peng","orcid":"0000-0002-1774-7229","id":"37085880319"},{"name":"Yafei Tian","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Tian","orcid":"0000-0003-4339-8285","id":"37532365900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8186193","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":590},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Array signal processing","Chirp","Estimation error","Signal to noise ratio","Robustness","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO communication","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware complexity","millimeter wave massive multiple-input multiple-output system","hybrid precoding","inaccurate channel angular information","robust wide-beam analog","angle estimation error variance","chirp sequence","robust analog beamforming method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Angular information","beamforming","estimation error","hybrid precoding","massive MIMO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186193","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8309483/08186193.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"641","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2782322","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2782322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Wide-Beam Analog Beamforming With Inaccurate Channel Angular Information","abstract":"Hybrid precoding is widely used in millimeter wave massive multiple-input multiple-output system to reduce the hardware complexity.

In this paper, a hierarchical day-ahead DSM model is proposed, where renewable energy sources are integrated. The proposed model consists of three layers: the utility in the upper layer, the demand response (DR) aggregator in the middle layer, and customers in the lower layer. The utility seeks to minimize the operation cost and give part of the revenue to the DR aggregator as a bonus. The DR aggregator acts as an intermediary, receiving bonus from the utility and giving compensation to customers for modifying their energy usage pattern. The aim of the DR aggregator is to maximize its net benefit. Customers desire to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the received compensation minus the dissatisfactory level. To achieve these objectives, a multiobjective problem is formulated. An artificial immune algorithm is used to solve this problem, leading to a Pareto optimal set. Using a selection criterion, a Pareto optimal solution can be selected, which does not favour any particular participant to ensure the overall fairness. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of the proposed method: The utility can reduce the operation cost and the peak to average ratio; the DR aggregator can make a profit for providing DSM services; and customers can reduce their bill.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186194/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17682760","htmlLink":"/document/8186194/","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization for Demand Side Management Program in Smart Grid","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UK EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/P005950/1"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"106-2221-E-007-127"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multiobjective Optimization for Demand Side Management Program in Smart Grid","sourcePdf":"tii-sun-2776104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0757S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8331183","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8331183","articleId":"8186194","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8186195,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In particular, non-orthogonal circularly filtered waveforms such as generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) were proposed due to flexibility and robustness. Applying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques for future wireless networks are unquestionable and thereby compulsory for any alternative waveform. Despite advancements in accurate MIMO detection algorithms for GFDM, compared with CP-OFDM their complexity still exhibited a higher order of magnitude, impeding an energy-efficient implementation. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity formulation for iterative minimum mean squared error with parallel interference cancellation (MMSE-PIC) detection for non-orthogonal waveforms with localized inter-carrier interference, where we focus on the application to MIMO-GFDM. The proposal achieves complexity similar to CP-OFDM and we evaluate its performance under realistic channel conditions with imperfect channel state information, where we obtain up to 2-dB gain of GFDM compared with OFDM. We confirm our findings by analyzing the measured extrinsic information transfer charts and show that the proposal achieves the performance of optimal maximum likelihood detection. The results point out the MMSE-PIC algorithm as a viable technique for iterative MIMO receiver implementations for non-orthogonal waveforms.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2782339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2782339","startPage":"1467","endPage":"1480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8338165/08186198.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Iterative MMSE-PIC Detection for MIMO-GFDM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Iterative MMSE-PIC Detection for MIMO-GFDM","volume":"66","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699069","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8186198/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"Federal Ministry of Education and Research within the programme Twenty20 - Partnership for Innovation - \u201cfast wireless\u201d","grantNumber":"03ZZ0505B"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Iterative MMSE-PIC Detection for MIMO-GFDM","sourcePdf":"tcomm-matthe-2782339-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141766S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8338165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8338165","articleId":"8186198","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8186199,"authors":[{"name":"Danping He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8186199/he-2782268-small.gif","p":["Danping He (M\u201916) received the B.E. degree from the Huazhong\n University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008, the M.Sc. degree from the Universite Catholique de\n Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, and Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree from the\n Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2014.","In 2012, she was a Visiting Scholar with the Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique,\n France.

In this paper, the influence of typical objects to the mmWave propagation channel is analyzed for \u201ctrain-to-infrastructure\u201d and \u201cintrawagon\u201d railway scenarios with various configurations. Propagation measurements are conducted in the mmWave band for the 12 most common railway materials. The corresponding electromagnetic parameters are obtained, and a 3-D ray tracing (RT) simulator is calibrated. The mean absolute error of the simulated S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>\n parameter is -53.5 dB, indicating that the calibrated RT can be used to generate the close-to-real mmWave channel for railway scenarios. Statistically consistent scenarios and deployments are generated, which enables drawing unbiased numerical results based on intensive RT simulations. The influence of typical objects and corresponding material compositions is then compared, and significant objects are determined for each scenario. The results of this work not only imply how the propagation environment impacts on the propagation channel, but also make suggestions to efficiently reconstruct railway environment models for an accurate RT-based channel model. Moreover, the understanding of the influence of the environment at object and material levels will, in turn, guide the construction of railway infrastructure for better railway services.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2782268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08186199.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2782268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","startPage":"2880","endPage":"2892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Typical Railway Objects in a mmWave Propagation Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Typical Railway Objects in a mmWave Propagation Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17699055","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8186199/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771036, 61725101, 61501021 and U1334202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"L161009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005023","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety","grantNumber":"RCS2017ZZ004 and RCS2017ZT008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Typical Railway Objects in a mmWave Propagation Channel","sourcePdf":"tvt-he-2782268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094759S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8186199","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8186200,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Qi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8186200/qi-2782343-small.gif","p":["Yuan Qi received the B.S. degree in communication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecomm (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.

It is well known that the computational cost of MIMO detection based on QR decomposition is directly proportional to the number of nonzero entries involved in back-substitution and slicing operations in the triangularized channel matrix, which can be too high for low-latency applications involving large MIMO dimensions. By systematically puncturing the channel to have a specific structure, it is demonstrated that the detection process can be accelerated by employing standard schemes, such as chase detection, list detection, nulling-and-cancellation detection, and sub-space detection on the transformed matrix. The performance of these schemes is characterized and analyzed mathematically, and bounds on the achievable diversity gain and probability of bit error are derived. Surprisingly, it is shown that puncturing does not negatively impact the receive diversity gain in hard-output detectors. The analysis is extended to soft-output detection when computing per-layer bit log-likelihood ratios; it is shown that significant performance gains are attainable by ordering the layer of interest to be at the root when puncturing the channel. Simulations of coded and uncoded scenarios certify that the proposed schemes scale up efficiently both in the number of antennas and constellation size, as well as in the presence of correlated channels. In particular, soft-output per-layer sub-space detection is shown to achieve a 2.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio gain at 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n bit error rate in 256-quadratic-amplitude modulation 16 \u00d7 16 MIMO, while saving 77% of nulling-and-cancellation computations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2782341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2782341","startPage":"2421","endPage":"2436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8385566/08186206.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large MIMO Detection Schemes Based on Channel Puncturing: Performance and Complexity Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Large MIMO Detection Schemes Based on Channel Puncturing: Performance and Complexity Analysis","volume":"66","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17839532","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8186206/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007175","fundingName":"National Council for Scientific Research, Lebanon"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007688","fundingName":"University Research Board, American University of Beirut"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large MIMO Detection Schemes Based on Channel Puncturing: Performance and Complexity Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcomm-sarieddeen-2782341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100832S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8385566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8385566","articleId":"8186206","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8186211,"authors":[{"name":"Jaemin Baek","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8307303/8186211/baek-2782238-small.gif","p":["Jaemin Baek (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree in mechanical\n engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2011.

The proposed ATDC uses a time-delayed signal to cancel complex nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, and hence to provide a simple structure. The adaptive law of the proposed ATDC is developed to adjust the control gains appropriately while in operation and then to achieve good tracking performance with tolerant fluctuation and fast convergence speed. Such adaptive control gains are shown to have an effect of adding an adaptive auxiliary control to a conventional time-delay control (TDC). Moreover, the proposed ATDC includes a typical sliding-mode control as a second auxiliary control to suppress the time-delay estimation (TDE) errors caused by the time-delayed signal so that robust performance can be achieved. It is shown by the bounded input bounded output stability theory and a Lyapunov approach that the TDE errors are bounded and the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded, respectively. The practical effectiveness of the proposed ATDC, or the synergistic effect of two auxiliary controls, is illustrated in simulations and experiments with robot manipulators.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2782238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8307303/08186211.pdf","startPage":"5682","endPage":"5692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2782238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Time-Delay Control With Adaptive Gains for Trajectory Tracking of Robot Manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Practical Time-Delay Control With Adaptive Gains for Trajectory Tracking of Robot Manipulators","volume":"65","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17630187","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8186211/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186211/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Industrial Fundamental Technology Development Program and the Human Resources Program of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, South Korea","grantNumber":"10062312 and 20174030201660"},{"fundingName":"MSIP","grantNumber":"IITP-R0346-16-1007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Time-Delay Control With Adaptive Gains for Trajectory Tracking of Robot Manipulators","sourcePdf":"tie-han-2782238-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117343S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8307303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8307303","articleId":"8186211","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8186218,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos Antonio Salvador","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Power Electronics Institute, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8307303/8186218/salva-2782239-small.gif","p":["Marcos Antonio Salvador was born in Blumenau, Brazil, in 1985.

Here, we demonstrate that the NC effect occurs within a time window which is bounded by the switching time of ferroelectric domains at the faster time limit and screening charge compensation time of polarization at the slower time limit. We study this temporal dynamics of NC effect both by performing the transient measurements of metal-ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide-insulator-semiconductor capacitor connected in series with a load resistor and by characterizing NC field-effect transistors (NCFETs) at different time scales.

It is also a crucial challenge for energy storage systems to predict RUL and diagnose SOH of batteries due to the complicated aging mechanism. In this paper, a novel method for battery RUL prediction and SOH estimation is proposed. First, a novel support vector regression-based battery SOH state-space model is established to simulate the battery aging mechanism, which takes the capacity as the state variable and takes the representative features during a constant-current and constant-voltage protocol as the input variables. The estimated impedance variables are taken as the output due to the correlation between battery capacity and the sum of charge transfer resistance and electrolyte resistance. Second, in order to suppress the measurement noises of current and voltage, a particle filter is employed to estimate the impedance degradation parameters. Furthermore, experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed SOH estimation method can provide an accurate and robustness result. The proposed RUL prediction framework can also ensure an accurate RUL prediction result.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2017.2782224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8307303/08186223.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2017.2782224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307303","startPage":"5634","endPage":"5643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remaining Useful Life Prediction and State of Health Diagnosis for Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Particle Filter and Support Vector Regression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Remaining Useful Life Prediction and State of Health Diagnosis for Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Particle Filter and Support Vector Regression","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186223/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17630237","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8186223/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61375079"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remaining Useful Life Prediction and State of Health Diagnosis for Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Particle Filter and Support Vector Regression","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2782224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079983S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8307303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"8307303","articleId":"8186223","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8186226,"authors":[{"name":"Kenzo Isogawa","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenzo","lastName":"Isogawa","orcid":"0000-0002-8307-6929","id":"37086267606"},{"name":"Takashi Ida","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Ida","orcid":"0000-0003-0688-5076","id":"37086268905"},{"name":"Taichiro Shiodera","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Taichiro","lastName":"Shiodera","orcid":"0000-0002-7943-0518","id":"37564690000"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Takeguchi","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development Center, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Takeguchi","id":"37086263729"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8186226","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2444},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise level","Noise reduction","Convolution","Neural networks","Noise measurement","Training data","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","image denoising","image restoration","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple noise-level-specific CNNs","soft shrinkage","deep-CNN","deep convolutional neural networks","denoising methods","noise level","adaptive noise reduction","deep shrinkage convolutional neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks (CNN)","image denoising","soft shrinkage","supervised learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2782270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2782270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/8207709/08186226.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Shrinkage Convolutional Neural Network for Adaptive Noise Reduction","abstract":"The noise level of an image depends on settings of an imaging device. The settings can be used to select appropriate parameters for denoising methods. But denoising methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep-CNN) do not have such adjustable parameters. Therefore, a deep-CNN whose training data contain limited levels of noise does not effectively restore images whose noise level is different from the training data. If the range of noise levels of training data is extended to solve the problem, the maximum performance of a produced deep-CNN is limited. To solve the tradeoff, we propose a deep-CNN that is adjustable to the noise level of the input image immediately. We use soft shrinkage for activation functions of our deep-CNN. The soft shrinkage has thresholds proportional to the noise level given by the user. We also propose an optimization method for proportionality coefficients for the thresholds of soft shrinkage. Our method optimizes the coefficients for various noise levels simultaneously. In our experiment using a test set whose noise level is from 5 to 50, the proposed method showed higher PSNR than that in the case of the conventional method using only one deep-CNN, and PSNR comparable to that in the case of the conventional method using multiple noise-level-specific CNNs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17466662","htmlLink":"/document/8186226/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep Shrinkage Convolutional Neural Network for Adaptive Noise Reduction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Shrinkage Convolutional Neural Network for Adaptive Noise Reduction","sourcePdf":"lsp-isogawa-2782270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043528S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8207709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8207709","articleId":"8186226","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8186234,"authors":[{"name":"Jinchen Bao","affiliation":["Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8536744/8186234/bao-2782325-small.gif","p":["Jinchen Bao received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in information and communication engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2010 and 2017, respectively.

By optimizing the distribution of fragment patches in an open loop, a microstrip open-loop resonator can be miniaturized so that the data capacity of the chipless RFID tag designed using such a miniaturized loop resonator can be significantly increased. Moreover, the resonant frequency of the fragment-loaded resonator can be adjusted conveniently by removing or disconnecting some fragment patches, which provides great flexibility for data encoding of the chipless RFID tag. The proposed chipless RFID tag with miniaturized open-loop resonators is designed and tested and can acquire 3.56 bits per resonator and a coding density of approximately 745.1 bits/\u03bb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">g</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.

The significant changes of low-level memory devices cause nontrivial challenges to high-level in-memory and in-cache data structure design due to overlooking the NVM device properties. In this paper, we study an important and common data structure, hash table, which is ubiquitous and widely used to construct the index and lookup table in main memory and caches. Based on the observations that existing hashing schemes cause many extra writes to NVMs, we propose a cost-efficient write-friendly hashing scheme, called path hashing, which incurs no extra writes to NVMs while delivers high performance. The basic idea of path hashing is to leverage a novel hash-collision resolution method, i.e., position sharing, which meets the needs of insertion and deletion requests without extra writes to NVMs. By further exploiting double-path hashing and path shortening techniques, path hashing delivers high performance of hash tables in terms of space utilization and request latency. Nevertheless, the original path hashing has low utilization of each cache line for small items, causing low cache efficiency. We hence propose a cache-optimized path hashing to pack multiple cells in the same path together and store them into one cache line, thus improving the cache line utilization to obtain higher performance. We have implemented path hashing and used a gem5 full system simulator with NVMain to evaluate its performance in the context of NVMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that path hashing incurs no extra writes to NVMs, and achieves up to 95 percent space utilization ratio as well as low request latency, compared with existing state-of-the-art hashing schemes. We have released the source code of path hashing for public use at github.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2017.2782251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/8334163/08186236.pdf","startPage":"985","endPage":"998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2017.2782251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8334163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Write-Friendly and Cache-Optimized Hashing Scheme for Non-Volatile Memory Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186236","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186236/","displayDocTitle":"A Write-Friendly and Cache-Optimized Hashing Scheme for Non-Volatile Memory Systems","volume":"29","issue":"5","publicationDate":"1 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17685495","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8186236/","dateOfInsertion":"09 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB1000202"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61772212"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture","grantNumber":"CARCH201505"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Write-Friendly and Cache-Optimized Hashing Scheme for Non-Volatile Memory Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-hua-2782251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125457S","chronDate":"May 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"8334163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8334163","articleId":"8186236","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8186238,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Guerreiro","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal","Universidade Aut\u00f3noma de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8338165/8186238/guerr-2782321-small.gif","p":["Jo\u00e3o Guerreiro (S\u201915\u2013M\u201917) received the M.Sc. and the Ph.D. degrees from the Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.

Although surrogate-based optimization is a promising solution, the challenge to the optimization efficiency is still considerable. Aiming to address this challenge, a new method, called the parallel adjoint sensitivity and Gaussian process assisted hybrid optimization technique (PAGHO), is presented. The central concept is a new optimization framework employing computationally cheap partial derivatives obtained by the adjoint sensitivity method to tackle computationally expensive infill sampling for surrogate-based optimization. A silicon microactuator and a mathematical benchmark problem with different kinds of challenges are selected as the test cases.

Motivated by a study of brain-wide 4D imaging of neural activity in C. elegans, we present a new method of multi-cell tracking. Data types to which the method is applicable are characterized as follows: (i) cells are imaged as globular-like objects, (ii) it is difficult to distinguish cells on the basis of shape and size only, (iii) the number of imaged cells in the several-hundred range, (iv) movements of nearly-located cells are strongly correlated, and (v) cells do not divide. We developed a tracking software suite that we call SPF-CellTracker. Incorporating dependency on the cells' movements into the prediction model is the key for reducing the tracking errors: the cell switching and the coalescence of the tracked positions. We model the target cells' correlated movements as a Markov random field and we also derive a fast computation algorithm, which we call spatial particle filter. With the live-imaging data of the nuclei of C. elegans neurons in which approximately 120 nuclei of neurons were imaged, the proposed method demonstrated improved accuracy compared to the standard particle filter and the method developed by Tokunaga et al.

Contrary to traditional approaches that aim at eliminating this effect, in this paper we propose a joint analog-digital (AD) beamforming scheme that exploits this effect to further improve the system performance. A jointly optimal AD beamformer is first obtained by iteratively maximizing the minimum received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio in the digital domain, followed by an optimization on the load impedance of each antenna element in the analog domain. We further introduce a decoupled low-complexity approach, with which existing closed-form beamforming schemes can also be efficiently applied. For the consideration of hardware imperfections in practice, we study the case where the analog load values are quantized, and propose a sequential search scheme based on greedy algorithm to efficiently obtain the desired quantized load values. Moreover, we also investigate the imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios, where we prove the optimality for closed-form beamformers, and further propose the robust schemes for two typical CSI error models. Simulation results show that with the proposed schemes the mutual coupling effect can be exploited to further improve the performance for both perfect CSI and imperfect CSI.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","accessionNumber":"17699053","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8186257/","displayDocTitle":"Analog\u2013Digital Beamforming in the MU-MISO Downlink by Use of Tunable Antenna Loads","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","grantNumber":"EP/M014150/1 and EP/M014126/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analog\u2013Digital Beamforming in the MU-MISO Downlink by Use of Tunable Antenna Loads","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2776563-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159928S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8186257","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8186302,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Hou","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8186302/hou-2782258-small.gif","p":["Yonghong Hou (M\u201911) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from Xidian University, China, in 1991, and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information system from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2003 and 2009, respectively.

It proposes to represent a depth map sequence into three pairs of structured dynamic images (DIs) at body, part, and joint levels, respectively, through hierarchical bidirectional rank pooling. Different from previous works that applied one convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for each part/joint separately, one pair of structured DIs is constructed from depth maps at each granularity level and serves as the input of a ConvNet. The structured DI not only preserves the spatial-temporal information but also enhances the structure information across both body parts/joints and different temporal scales. In additionally, it requires low computational cost and memory to construct. This new representation, referred to as Spatially and Temporally Structured Dynamic Depth Images, aggregates from global to fine-grained levels motion and structure information in a depth sequence, and enables us to fine-tune the existing ConvNet models trained on image data for classification of depth sequences, without a need for training the models afresh. The proposed representation is evaluated on six benchmark data sets, namely, MSRAction3D, G3D, MSRDailyActivity3D, SYSU 3D HOI, UTD-MHAD, and M2I data sets and achieves the state-of-the-art results on all six data sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2018","accessionNumber":"17573834","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8186302/","displayDocTitle":"Spatially and Temporally Structured Global to Local Aggregation of Dynamic Depth Information for Action Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571325"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004712","fundingName":"Key Projects in the Tianjin Science and Technology Pillar Program","grantNumber":"15ZCZD GX001900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Spatially and Temporally Structured Global to Local Aggregation of Dynamic Depth Information for Action Recognition","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2782258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156436S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8186302","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8186303,"authors":[{"name":"Junwei Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8186303/li-2778740-small.gif","p":["Junwei Li is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, China, in 2013.

However, target drift and tracking failure caused by background clutter and target appearance change (resulting from scale variation and deformation and so on) are still challenging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new tracking method within the CF framework in this paper. First, we learn a large margin CF by exploiting discriminative background patches. Contrary to conventional CF trackers that aim to maximize target response, we model a tracker that maximizes the margin between the target and surrounding background by exploiting background information effectively. To remedy the deficiency in handling target scale variation of CF-based trackers, we propose to train a CF by multi-level scale supervision, which aims to make CF sensitive to the target scale variation. Then, we integrate the two individual modules into one framework to simplify our tracking model. The proposed method can effectively prevent tracking module degradation introduced by target appearance changes. Extensive experiments conducted on public available data sets OTB-50/100 demonstrate that the proposed tracking method is robust to the background clutter and discriminative to the target scale variation. Both qualitative and quantitative results show the excellent performance against some state-of-the-art trackers.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2778740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08186303.pdf","startPage":"12642","endPage":"12655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2778740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186303/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Object Tracking via Large Margin and Scale-Adaptive Correlation Filter","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17627947","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8186303/","dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61403342, U1509207 and 61325019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LY18F030020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Object Tracking via Large Margin and Scale-Adaptive Correlation Filter","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-2778740-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082597S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8186303","onlineDate":"11 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8186371,"authors":[{"name":"Harald Enzinger","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Speech Communication Laboratory, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Enzinger","id":"37085413161"},{"name":"Karl Freiberger","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Speech Communication Laboratory, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Freiberger","id":"37085413666"},{"name":"Christian Vogel","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Speech Communication Laboratory, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Vogel","id":"37269815900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"8186371","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1019},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186371","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","OFDM","Low pass filters","Distortion","Linearity","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","energy consumption","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","statistical distributions","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["competitive linearity","envelope tracking","dual-band crest factor reduction","2D-vector-switched digital predistortion","wireless communication standards","data rates","energy consumption","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","Long-Term Evolution","LTE","Wi-Fi applications","energy efficiency","statistical distribution","OFDM signals","power amplifiers"]}],"abstract":"As wireless communication standards evolve to support ever-higher data rates, the required linearity and bandwidth must increase, which leads to higher energy consumption [1].

Most of the anomaly detection methods in this domain are based on Euclidean distance for similarity measure of monitoring parameters. However, the Euclidean distance has many limitations on telemetry data similarity measure and may affect the detecting performance. Therefore, improved distance measures and combined distance measures are applied in telemetry data analysis.

It serves as a great example for helping in on-demand and ubiquitous access to a cluster of computing resources that are configurable.(For example: applications, servers and services, storage and computer networks) which can be helpful in rapid provisioning and can be released with a minimum management effort. Balancing the load suitably provides a major challenging issue in this scenario. It specifies a method of distributing the workload in accordance to the respective virtual machines. User requests are random and their allocation across VMs more randomly can cause heavier load and can affect its performance as a whole which reflects in affecting the resources used for computation. A Stochastic Hill Climbing algorithm is a algorithm which does not find the exact virtual machine to which the incoming job must be allocated so that the resource utilization is effective with a minimum response time. This can be avoided if an algorithm called Join Idle Queue can be combined along with it which finds the appropriate virtual machine for the job to be done which in turn improves the resource utilization. Therefore, SIQ algorithm is proposed to optimize the response time and performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Algorithms, Methodology, Models and Applications in Emerging Technologies (ICAMMAET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125198/8186622/08186673.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Algorithms, Methodology, Models and Applications in Emerging Technologies (ICAMMAET)","doi":"10.1109/ICAMMAET.2017.8186673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMMAET.2017.8186673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8186622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SIQ algorithm for efficient load balancing in cloud","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Load management","Algorithm design and analysis","Time factors","Resource management","Virtual machining","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cluster computing","Internet","optimisation","queueing theory","resource allocation","stochastic processes","ubiquitous computing","virtual machines","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource utilization","SIQ algorithm","cloud computing","internet dependent computing type","ubiquitous access","computer networks","rapid provisioning","minimum management effort","user requests","Stochastic Hill Climbing algorithm","minimum response time","virtual machines","cloud load balancing","computing resource cluster","Join Idle Queue","optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Stochastic Hill Climbing","Join Idle-Queue","Load balancing","SIQ Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"SIQ algorithm for efficient load balancing in cloud","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8186673/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17429881","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SIQ algorithm for efficient load balancing in cloud","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"28ICAMMA.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069834S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125198","isNumber":"8186622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125198","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8186622","articleId":"8186673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8186675,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivasa Rao Vemu","affiliation":["ECE Dept, Vishnu Women Engineering College, AP, India"],"firstName":"Srinivasa Rao","lastName":"Vemu","id":"37086275765"},{"name":"P.

The need for energy efficient and high speed analog-to-digital converters is necessary for the use of dynamic regenerative comparators to improve speed and efficiency of power. Fast ADCs, such as flash ADCs, requires an energy efficient comparator with small chip area. In this work comparison is performed among the delay of single Tail comparator, Double Tail Comparator and double tail comparator for less power theoretically and practically. The sub threshold leakage of transistors has usually been very small in the off state, as gate voltage is below threshold. The leakage from all sources has increased as the technology scales down. But as voltages have been scaled down with transistor size, sub threshold leakage has become a considerable factor. Fast comparators in CMOS having the problem of less rail voltages when threshold-voltages(Vt) of the devices are not scaled at the same speed as the rail voltages of the latest CMOS techniques. The proposed work consumes less power about 290mW compared to other types of comparators. The delay for the proposed architecture proved to be 10 ns which is less compared to the other comparators.","doi":"10.1109/ICAMMAET.2017.8186675","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Algorithms, Methodology, Models and Applications in Emerging Technologies (ICAMMAET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Algorithms, Methodology, Models and Applications in Emerging Technologies (ICAMMAET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125198/8186622/08186675.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8186622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMMAET.2017.8186675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy efficient and high speed double tail comparator using cadence EDA tools","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An energy efficient and high speed double tail comparator using cadence EDA tools","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186675/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17429931","htmlLink":"/document/8186675/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy efficient and high speed double tail comparator using cadence EDA tools","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"2ICAMMA.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057883S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125198","isNumber":"8186622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125198","xplore-issue":"8186622","articleId":"8186675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8186683,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These transforms finds application in compression, enhancement, pattern recognition, and feature extraction etc. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is a widely used wavelet transformation. DWT transforms image from space domain to frequency domain, where the wavelets are discretely sampled. DWT has various advantages over other image transforms such as image can be represented in multi resolution form, avoids the division of image into non-overlapping blocks, blocking artifacts are avoided to achieve a high compression ratio, better identification of data suitable for human perception, provides better localization in spatial and frequency domain. DWT implemented on software [Matlab] usually has lower throughput, which is due to high overall design cycle time. This can be improved through hardware implementation of DWT. In this paper an effective high speed DWT architecture has been designed using Distributed Arithmetic (DA) concept. The designed architecture has been simulated and synthesized by using Verilog HDL for the selected device ZYNQZC706 (7z045ffg900-2). Our implementation is validated on a natural image of dimension 512*512. This implementation reduces the overall design cycle time to 0.670 nanoseconds.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Algorithms, Methodology, Models and Applications in Emerging Technologies (ICAMMAET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125198/8186622/08186683.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Algorithms, Methodology, Models and Applications in Emerging Technologies (ICAMMAET)","doi":"10.1109/ICAMMAET.2017.8186683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMMAET.2017.8186683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8186622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware implementation of discrete wavelet transform for compression of a natural image","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Computer architecture","Image coding","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","data compression","discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","high-pass filters","image coding","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware implementation","discrete wavelet transform","natural image","digital images","image transforms","DWT transforms image","space domain","frequency domain","wavelets","multiresolution form","high compression ratio","design cycle time","wavelet transformation","high speed DWT architecture","Verilog HDL","Distributed Arithmetic concept","DA concept","time 0.67 ns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Processing","Image Compression","DWT","FPGA Implementation","Distributed Arithmetic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A hardware implementation of discrete wavelet transform for compression of a natural image","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8186683/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17429945","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware implementation of discrete wavelet transform for compression of a natural image","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"37ICAMMA.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062815S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125198","isNumber":"8186622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125198","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8186622","articleId":"8186683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8186687,"authors":[{"name":"Ruchi Varma","affiliation":["ECE Department, N.I.T, Patna"],"firstName":"Ruchi","lastName":"Varma","id":"37085789490"},{"name":"Jayanta Ghosh","affiliation":["ECE Department, N.I.T, Patna"],"firstName":"Jayanta","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37085794399"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3378-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3379-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8186687","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Dual band","Slot antennas","Microstrip antennas","Knowledge based systems","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","microstrip antennas","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","multifrequency antennas","planar inverted-F antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Knowledge based neural network modeling","dual band PIFA","radiating patch","ground plane size","radiation patterns","broadside radiation characteristics","frequency bands","slots dimensions","compact dual band planar inverted-F antenna","KBNN","mobile phone","frequency 4.0 GHz to 5.0 GHz","size 12.0 mm","size 40.0 mm","size 15 mm","size 40 mm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186687","abstract":"In this paper, a more compact dual band planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) has been proposed.

The bids of the clients are firstly sequenced within the competition deadline. Secondly, a screening of the client group is done and the VM resource that corresponds to it is configured in accordance to the minimal cost of the service providers. Lastly, payment price is finalised by taking average payment as well as payment made by competitors into consideration thereby enabling the timely completion of the VM resource task. The results of the simulation experiments prove that the algorithm proposal that was made is capable of enhancing efficiently the QoS or the Quality of Service of the cloud environment, and also ensure that the profits of the providers of cloud service and the rate of resource utilization of VM are efficiently completed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimised scheduling in cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Algorithms, Methodology, Models and Applications in Emerging Technologies (ICAMMAET)","doi":"10.1109/ICAMMAET.2017.8186712","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Algorithms, Methodology, Models and Applications in Emerging Technologies (ICAMMAET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125198/8186622/08186712.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMMAET.2017.8186712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8186622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimised scheduling in cloud computing","conferenceDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8186712/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"17429926","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimised scheduling in cloud computing","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"63ICAMMA.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067126S","chronDate":"16-18 Feb. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125198","isNumber":"8186622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125198","xplore-issue":"8186622","articleId":"8186712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8186747,"authors":[{"name":"Songran Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Songran","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086315392"},{"name":"Zhe Li","affiliation":["School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Li","id":"37086313364"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3378-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3379-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8186747","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2002},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Complex networks","Biological cells","Encoding","Partitioning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex networks","genetic algorithms","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial random network","MGA algorithm","community detection","modified genetic algorithm","complex networks","data processing","time complexity","half uniform crossover","community structure","community index","communities the network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Community detection","Data processing","Genetic Algorithm","Modularity function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8186747","abstract":"Community detection has a very important role in data processing and analysis, which is very hot in recent years.

In the algorithm, each allele of the chromosome stands for the community index of the corresponding node.

The data stream agenda now pervades many branches of Computer Science including databases, networking, knowledge discovery and data mining, and hardware systems. Industry is in synch too, with Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) and special hardware to deal with data speeds. Even beyond Computer Science, data stream concerns are emerging in physics, atmospheric science and statistics. Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications focuses on the algorithmic foundations of data streaming. In the data stream scenario, input arrives very rapidly and there is limited memory to store the input. Algorithms have to work with one or few passes over the data, space less than linear in the input size or time significantly less than the input size. In the past few years, a new theory has emerged for reasoning about algorithms that work within these constraints on space, time and number of passes. Some of the methods rely on metric embeddings, pseudo-random computations, sparse approximation theory and communication complexity. The applications for this scenario include IP network traffic analysis, mining text message streams and processing massive data sets in general. Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications surveys the emerging area of algorithms for processing data streams and associated applications. An extensive bibliography with over 200 entries points the reader to further resources for exploration.","doi":"10.1561/0400000002","publicationTitle":"Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications","pdfPath":"/ebooks/8186985/8186986.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1561/0400000002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=null","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications","pdfUrl":"/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8186986.pdf&bkn=8186985&pdfType=book","publisher":"Now Foundations and Trends","displayDocTitle":"Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8186985/","isBook":true,"isBookWithoutChapters":true,"copyrightYear":"2005","xploreDocumentType":"books","copyrightOwner":"Now Publishers Inc","articleId":"8186985","title":"Data Streams: Algorithms and Applications","contentTypeDisplay":"Books","pages":"135","mlTime":"PT0.025702S","coverImage":"/ebooks/8186985/8186985.jpg","subType":"now Books & eBooks","lastupdate":"2021-08-23","contentType":"books","publicationNumber":"8186985"},{"_id":8187056,"authors":[{"name":"Matteo Berioli"},{"name":"Giuseppe Cocco"},{"name":"Gianluigi Liva"},{"name":"Andrea Munari"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"9781680832167","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"9781680832174","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8187056","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"abstract":"Modern day wireless communication systems rely heavily on the random access schemes that were originally developed in the 1970s. The pioneering Aloha protocol has become a key component of many communications standards, ranging from satellite networks to ad hoc and cellular scenarios. Recent developments, however, have seen a fundamental leap forward based on using the principles of successive interference cancellation. The modern random access protocols using these new techniques have opened up a wealth of new applications. This tutorial style monograph explores the main ideas and design principles that are behind some of these novel schemes. It introduces the reader to the analytical tools used to model such performance. Focussing on slotted solutions it shows how Aloha can be combined with successive interference cancellation and optimized using the theory of codes on graphs.

Theoretical results, inspiration from the brain and cognition, as well as machine learning experiments suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one would need deep architectures. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers, graphical models with many levels of latent variables, or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Each level of the architecture represents features at a different level of abstraction, defined as a composition of lower-level features. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but new algorithms have been discovered and a new sub-area has emerged in the machine learning community since 2006, following these discoveries. Learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks and other related unsupervised learning algorithms have recently been proposed to train deep architectures, yielding exciting results and beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. Learning Deep Architectures for AI discusses the motivations for and principles of learning algorithms for deep architectures. By analyzing and comparing recent results with different learning algorithms for deep architectures, explanations for their success are proposed and discussed, highlighting challenges and suggesting avenues for future explorations in this area.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Deep Architectures for AI","publicationTitle":"Learning Deep Architectures for AI","doi":"10.1561/2200000006","displayPublicationTitle":"Learning Deep Architectures for AI","pdfPath":"/ebooks/8187120/8187121.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1561/2200000006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=null","pdfUrl":"/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8187121.pdf&bkn=8187120&pdfType=book","publisher":"Now Foundations and Trends","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187120/","displayDocTitle":"Learning Deep Architectures for AI","xploreDocumentType":"books","isBook":true,"isBookWithoutChapters":true,"copyrightYear":"2009","copyrightOwner":"Now Publishers Inc","articleId":"8187120","title":"Learning Deep Architectures for AI","contentTypeDisplay":"Books","pages":"136","mlTime":"PT0.018156S","coverImage":"/ebooks/8187120/8187120.jpg","subType":"now Books & eBooks","lastupdate":"2021-10-09","contentType":"books","publicationNumber":"8187120"},{"_id":8187216,"authors":[{"name":"Antonia Tulino"},{"name":"Sergio Verd\u00fa"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"9781933019000","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"9781933019505","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8187216","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"pdfUrl":"/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8187217.pdf&bkn=8187216&pdfType=book","abstract":"Random matrix theory has found many applications in physics, statistics and engineering since its inception.

At each time step, a unit resource is allocated to an action and some observable payoff is obtained. The goal is to maximize the total payoff obtained in a sequence of allocations. The name bandit refers to the colloquial term for a slot machine (a \"one-armed bandit\" in American slang). In a casino, a sequential allocation problem is obtained when the player is facing many slot machines at once (a \"multi-armed bandit\"), and must repeatedly choose where to insert the next coin. Multi-armed bandit problems are the most basic examples of sequential decision problems with an exploration-exploitation trade-off. This is the balance between staying with the option that gave highest payoffs in the past and exploring new options that might give higher payoffs in the future. Although the study of bandit problems dates back to the 1930s, exploration-exploitation trade-offs arise in several modern applications, such as ad placement, website optimization, and packet routing. Mathematically, a multi-armed bandit is defined by the payoff process associated with each option. In this book, the focus is on two extreme cases in which the analysis of regret is particularly simple and elegant: independent and identically distributed payoffs and adversarial payoffs. Besides the basic setting of finitely many actions, it also analyzes some of the most important variants and extensions, such as the contextual bandit model. This monograph is an ideal reference for students and researchers with an interest in bandit problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"Regret Analysis of Stochastic and Nonstochastic Multi-armed Bandit Problems","pdfPath":"/ebooks/8187572/8187573.pdf","publicationTitle":"Regret Analysis of Stochastic and Nonstochastic Multi-armed Bandit Problems","doi":"10.1561/2200000024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1561/2200000024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=null","pdfUrl":"/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8187573.pdf&bkn=8187572&pdfType=book","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regret Analysis of Stochastic and Nonstochastic Multi-armed Bandit Problems","publisher":"Now Foundations and Trends","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187572/","displayDocTitle":"Regret Analysis of Stochastic and Nonstochastic Multi-armed Bandit Problems","isBook":true,"isBookWithoutChapters":true,"copyrightYear":"2012","xploreDocumentType":"books","copyrightOwner":"Now Publishers Inc","articleId":"8187572","title":"Regret Analysis of Stochastic and Nonstochastic Multi-armed Bandit Problems","contentTypeDisplay":"Books","pages":"134","mlTime":"PT0.013426S","coverImage":"/ebooks/8187572/8187572.jpg","subType":"now Books & eBooks","lastupdate":"2021-08-23","contentType":"books","publicationNumber":"8187572"},{"_id":8187586,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Bj\u00f6rnson"},{"name":"Eduard Jorswieck"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"9781601986382","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"9781601986399","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8187586","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"abstract":"The use of multiple antennas at base stations is a key component in the design of cellular communication systems that can meet high capacity demands. The downlink transmission from base stations to users is particularly limiting, because many applications primarily create downlink traffic. The user devices should also be inexpensive and energy-efficient, thus only simple reception algorithms are feasible. Under ideal conditions, the gain of employing multiple antennas is well-recognized: the data throughput increases linearly with the number of transmit antennas if the spatial dimension is utilized to serve many users in parallel. The practical performance of multi-cell systems is however limited by a variety of non-idealities, such as insufficient channel knowledge, high computational complexity, heterogeneous user conditions, limited backhaul capacity, transceiver impairments, and the constrained level of coordination between base stations. Optimal Resource Allocation in Coordinated Multi-Cell Systems presents in a tutorial manner a general framework for modeling different multi-cell scenarios, including clustered joint transmission, coordinated beamforming, interference channels, cognitive radio, and spectrum sharing between operators. The framework enables joint analysis and insights that are both scenario independent and dependent. A comprehensive characterization of resource allocation problem categories is also given, along with the corresponding numerical signal processing algorithms. This provides a pragmatic foundation for resource allocation where the system utility metric can be selected to achieve practical feasibility. The tutorial also derives and parameterizes the structure of the optimal resource allocation, in terms of beamforming vectors and optimal operating points. Optimal Resource Allocation in Coordinated Multi-Cell Systems provides a solid grounding and understanding for optimization of practical multi-cell systems and will be of interest to all researchers and engineers working on the practical design of such systems. The Matlab code is available online for some of the examples and algorithms in this tutorial.","displayPublicationTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation in Coordinated Multi-Cell Systems","pdfPath":"/ebooks/8187586/8187587.pdf","publicationTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation in Coordinated Multi-Cell Systems","doi":"10.1561/0100000069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1561/0100000069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=null","pdfUrl":"/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8187587.pdf&bkn=8187586&pdfType=book","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Resource Allocation in Coordinated Multi-Cell Systems","keywords":[{"kwd":["Signal Processing for Communications (Communications and Information Theory) 2.

units for processing intricate information in neuromorphic systems.

However, few studies have designed memristors as artificial neurons.

This neuron displays four critical features for action-potential-based computing: the all-or-nothing spiking of an action potential, threshold-driven spiking, a refractory period, and a strength-modulated frequency response. As a post-synaptic neuron, the designed neuron was demonstrated to be applicable to digit recognition. These results demonstrate that the developed artificial neuron can realize the basic functions of spiking neurons and has great potential for neuromorphic computing.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2017.2782752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/8269808/08187627.pdf","startPage":"308","endPage":"311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2017.2782752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8269808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Artificial Neuron Based on a Threshold Switching Memristor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Artificial Neuron Based on a Threshold Switching Memristor","volume":"39","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"25 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17535530","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8187627/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187627/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61521064, 61732020, 61422407, 61474136, 61334007, 61574166, 61404164 and 61522408"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research Development Program","grantNumber":"2017YFB0405603 and 2016YFA0201803"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Training Project for the Leading Talents in S&T","grantNumber":"ljrc201508"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Opening Project of the Key Laboratory of Microelectronics Devices and Integrated Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"Y7YS063005 and Y7YS033003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Artificial Neuron Based on a Threshold Switching Memristor","sourcePdf":"led-liu-2782752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05899S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"8269808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8269808","articleId":"8187627","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8187629,"authors":[{"name":"Junpeng Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","Air and Missile Defense College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/8249504/8187629/shi-2782746-small.gif","p":["Junpeng Shi received the M.Sc. degree from Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering with the Air and Missile Defense College.

Compared with the conventional coprime MIMO radar that requires prototype co-prime arrays for transmitter and receiver, the proposed configuration enlarges the inter-element spacing of transmitter with an integer expansion factor. By vectorizing the sample covariance matrix, the generalized sum and difference coarray (GSDC) concept is defined for exploiting the advantages of proposed configuration. The analytical expressions for the expansion factor, the maximum consecutive lags, and the number of unique lags are derived carefully. It is verified that GSDC can obtain more degrees of freedom (DOFs) with the increase of expansion factor.

In this paper, we consider the scenario that NB-IoT is deployed in an heterogeneous network and the quality of the direct link from the NB-IoT user equipment (TIE) to the serving base station (BS) cannot satisfy the quality of service requirement for transmission of vital sensing data. Thereupon, device-to-device (D2D) communication is adopted as a routing extension to NB-IoT systems, and thus, enables two-hop routes between NB-IoT TIE and the serving BS via a set of D2D relays. As the candidate TIE relays work in duty cycle to save energy, we derive a model to select a set of TIE relays and perform opportunistic D2D communication according to a working schedule. Two optimization problems are formulated aiming at achieving optimal expected delivery ratio (EDR) and expected two-hop delay, respectively. Dynamic programming-based algorithms are proposed to solve the optimization problems and obtain the optimal working schedule of the relays. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed maxEDR and minEED algorithms improves the system performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2782323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8375923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2782323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8375923/08187632.pdf","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrowband Internet of Things Systems With Opportunistic D2D Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Narrowband Internet of Things Systems With Opportunistic D2D Communication","volume":"5","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 June 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8187632/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840457","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187632/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772472, 61772551, 61502352, 61432015 and 61472367"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY17F020020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2017CFB503"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrowband Internet of Things Systems With Opportunistic D2D Communication","sourcePdf":"jiot-li-2782323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106417S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8375923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8375923","articleId":"8187632","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8187641,"authors":[{"name":"Walter Cerroni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Cerroni","orcid":"0000-0002-4629-031X","id":"37297169900"},{"name":"Luca Foschini","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Foschini","orcid":"0000-0001-9062-3647","id":"37282860500"},{"name":"Genady Ya.

Meanwhile, channel state information (CSI), as a promising positioning characteristic, has been gradually adopted as an enhanced channel metric in indoor positioning schemes. In this paper, we propose a CSI amplitude fingerprinting-based localization algorithm in Narrowband Internet of Things system, in which we optimize a centroid algorithm based on CSI propagation model. In particular, in the fingerprint matching, we utilize the method of multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis to calculate the Euclidean distance and time-reversal resonating strength between the target point and the reference points and then employ the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for location estimation. By conjugate gradient method, moreover, we optimize the localization error of triangular centroid algorithm and combine the positioning result with MDS and KNN's estimated position to get the final estimated position. Experiment results show that compared to some existing localization methods, our proposed algorithm can effectively reduce positioning error.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187642/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8187642/","dateOfInsertion":"08 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840458","volume":"5","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CSI Amplitude Fingerprinting-Based NB-IoT Indoor Localization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XDJK2016A011, XDJK2015C010, XDJK2015D023, XDJK2016D047 and XDJK 201710635069"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402381, 61503309, 61772432 and 61772433"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Key Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"CSTC2015JCYJBX0094"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005230","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing","grantNumber":"CSTC2016JCYJA0449"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M592619"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012546","fundingName":"Chongqing Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"XM2016002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSI Amplitude Fingerprinting-Based NB-IoT Indoor Localization","sourcePdf":"jiot-guo-2782479-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084187S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8375923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"8375923","articleId":"8187642","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8187643,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Sun","affiliation":["School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8430490/8187643/sun-2782745-small.gif","p":["Wen Sun (S\u201911\u2013M\u201916) received the B.E. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2014.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China.

Base stations (BSs), being powered by self-contained energy harvesting modules, may keep OFF during recharging, leading to super-frequent handovers for nodes and high network dynamics. Under such dynamics, multiple cooperating BSs for the service of a \u201csmart thing,\u201d referred to as coordinated multipoint (CoMP), become a feasible solution by effectively improving communication reliability. To the best of knowledge, this is the first work to consider CoMP uplink transmission to alleviate outage caused by energy harvesting of BSs in IoT. A simple CoMP uplink transmission scheme is proposed for each node of IoT to transmit to two cooperating BSs in a K-tier heterogeneous network. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed using tools of stochastic geometry, in terms of availability and average rate, considering the effect of energy capacity, energy charging rate, in a K-tier heterogeneous network. Performance evaluation through extensive simulations are conducted and it is shown that the simulation results fit well with the analytical ones. The performance of the proposed scheme is then compared with that of the non-CoMP scheme, and it is found that the proposed scheme can significantly improve availability and average rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8430490/08187643.pdf","startPage":"2585","endPage":"2595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2782745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2782745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8430490","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Multipoint-Based Uplink Transmission in Internet of Things Powered by Energy Harvesting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy harvesting","Uplink","Heterogeneous networks","Resource management","Internet of Things","Analytical models","Cellular networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cooperative communication","energy harvesting","Internet of Things","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic geometry","CoMP uplink transmission scheme","nonCoMP scheme","energy charging rate","energy capacity","K-tier heterogeneous network","smart thing","multiple cooperating BSs","high network dynamics","super-frequent handovers","self-contained energy harvesting modules","base stations","network design","unprecedented paradigm shift","IoT","coordinated multipoint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Auction","economic model","mobile edge computing","resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Multipoint-Based Uplink Transmission in Internet of Things Powered by Energy Harvesting","volume":"5","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8187643/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18025504","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771374, 61771373 and 61601357"},{"fundingName":"China 111 Project","grantNumber":"B16037"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"171501"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Multipoint-Based Uplink Transmission in Internet of Things Powered by Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"jiot-liu-2782745-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08316S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8430490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8430490","articleId":"8187643","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8187644,"authors":[{"name":"Fetia Bannour","affiliation":["LiSSi/TincNetwork Research Team, University of Paris-Est Cr\u00e9teil, Creteil, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8302422/8187644/banno-2782482-small.gif","p":["Fetia Bannour received the B.Eng. degree in multidisciplinary engineering from the Tunisia Polytechnic School of the University of Carthage, Tunisia, in 2014.

These key tenets offer new opportunities to introduce innovative applications and incorporate automatic and adaptive control aspects, thereby, easing network management and guaranteeing the user's quality of experience. Despite the excitement, SDN adoption raises many challenges including the scalability and reliability issues of centralized designs that can be addressed with the physical decentralization of the control plane. However, such physically distributed, but logically centralized systems bring an additional set of challenges. This paper presents a survey on SDN with a special focus on the distributed SDN control. Besides reviewing the SDN concept and studying the SDN architecture as compared to the classical one, the main contribution of this survey is a detailed analysis of state-of-the-art distributed SDN controller platforms which assesses their advantages and drawbacks and classifies them in novel ways (physical and logical classifications) in order to provide useful guidelines for SDN research and deployment initiatives. A thorough discussion on the major challenges of distributed SDN control is also provided along with some insights into emerging and future trends in that area.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2017.2782482","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8302422/08187644.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8302422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2017.2782482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","startPage":"333","endPage":"354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed SDN Control: Survey, Taxonomy, and Challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Distributed SDN Control: Survey, Taxonomy, and Challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187644/","volume":"20","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8187644/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2018","accessionNumber":"17599763","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed SDN Control: Survey, Taxonomy, and Challenges","sourcePdf":"comst-mellouk-2782482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162238S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8302422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"8302422","articleId":"8187644","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8187650,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Chu","affiliation":["5G Innovation Center, Institute of Communication Systems, University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8288638/8187650/chu-2782367-small.gif","p":["Zheng Chu (M\u201917) received the Ph.D. degree from Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K., in 2016.","He was with the Faculty of Science and Technology, Middlesex University, London, U.K., from 2016 to 2017.

A multiantenna power station (PS) provides the power to these sensor nodes during wireless energy transfer phase, and consequently the sensor nodes employ the harvested energy to transmit their own monitoring information to a fusion center during wireless information transfer (WIT) phase. The goal is to maximize the system sum throughput of the sensor network, where two different scenarios are considered, i.e., PS and the sensor nodes belong to the same or different service operator(s). For the first scenario, we propose a global optimal solution to jointly design the energy beamforming and time allocation. We further develop a closed-form solution for the proposed sum throughput maximization. For the second scenario in which the PS and the sensor nodes belong to different service operators, energy incentives are required for the PS to assist the sensor network. Specifically, the sensor network needs to pay in order to purchase the energy services released from the PS to support WIT. In this case, this paper exploits this hierarchical energy interaction, which is known as energy trading. We propose a quadratic energy trading-based Stackelberg game, linear energy trading-based Stackelberg game, and social welfare scheme, in which we derive the Stackelberg equilibrium for the formulated games, and the optimal solution for the social welfare scheme. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the performance of our proposed schemes.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2017.2782367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8288638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2017.2782367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things

The voltage-null point of the third harmonic on the SIR is theoretically derived and found for the first time. It is used as the exciting location for the selective feeding line so that the third harmonic cannot be excited and is suppressed successfully in the filter design. Meanwhile, the passband of the BPF operating at the fundamental resonant frequency (f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n) of the SIR can be optimized and obtained by tuning other parameters. By combining the proposed simple technique and the SIR merits, the resultant BPF owns several advantages, such as wide stopband and miniaturization. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed idea, two design examples of second-/fourth-order BPFs based on multilayer PCB are designed. In both designs, the third harmonic suppression is larger than 30 dB and the first spurious occurs at a frequency beyond 7f\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n.

Current solutions for anatomy detection are typically based on machine learning techniques that exploit large annotated image databases in order to learn the appearance of the captured anatomy. These solutions are subject to several limitations, including the use of suboptimal feature engineering techniques and most importantly the use of computationally suboptimal search-schemes for anatomy detection. To address these issues, we propose a method that follows a new paradigm by reformulating the detection problem as a behavior learning task for an artificial agent. We couple the modeling of the anatomy appearance and the object search in a unified behavioral framework, using the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning and multi-scale image analysis. In other words, an artificial agent is trained not only to distinguish the target anatomical object from the rest of the body but also how to find the object by learning and following an optimal navigation path to the target object in the imaged volumetric space. We evaluated our approach on 1487 3D-CT volumes from 532 patients, totaling over 500,000 image slices and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on detecting several anatomical structures with no failed cases from a clinical acceptance perspective, while also achieving a 20-30 percent higher detection accuracy. Most importantly, we improve the detection-speed of the reference methods by 2-3 orders of magnitude, achieving unmatched real-time performance on large 3D-CT scans.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2782687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8558620/08187667.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2782687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558620","startPage":"176","endPage":"189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time 3D-Landmark Detection in CT Scans","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time 3D-Landmark Detection in CT Scans","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18292232","pubMedId":"29990011","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8187667/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time 3D-Landmark Detection in CT Scans","sourcePdf":"tpami-ghesu-2782687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142734S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8558620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8558620","articleId":"8187667","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8187671,"authors":[{"name":"Binayak Kar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Chung-Li, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Binayak Kar is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Taiwan.

Virtualized network functions (VNFs) are chained together to provide the required functionality at runtime on demand. It has a direct impact on power consumption depending on where and how these VNFs are placed and chained to accomplish certain demands as the power consumption of a physical machine (PM) depends on its traffic load. One of the advantages of VNF placement over traditional virtual machine placement is that virtualization is not limited solely to servers. The PMs, including the servers and varying loads to these machines and their utilization, are critical issues related to the network's energy consumption. In this paper, we designed a dynamic energy-saving model with NFV technology using an M/M/c queuing network with the minimum capacity policy where a certain amount of load is required to start the machine, which increases the utilization of the machine and avoids frequent changes of the machines' states. We formulate an energy-cost optimization problem with capacity and delay as constraints. We propose a dynamic placement of VNF chains (DPVC) heuristic solution to the NP-hard problem. The results show that the DPVC solution performs better and saves more energy. It uses 45%-55% less active nodes to satisfy the requested demands and increases the utilization of the active nodes by 40%-50% compared to other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2017.2782370","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","startPage":"372","endPage":"386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2017.2782370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8310716","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/8310716/08187671.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Virtualization","Servers","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","optimisation","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy cost optimization","dynamic placement","virtualized network function chains","network function virtualization","virtualization technologies","power consumption","physical machine","traffic load","VNF placement","traditional virtual machine placement","dynamic energy-saving model","NFV technology","M/M/c queuing network","energy-cost optimization problem","VNF chains heuristic solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Virtualized network function","service chaining","Markov model","energy consumption","cost optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Cost Optimization in Dynamic Placement of Virtualized Network Function Chains","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187671/","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8187671/","accessionNumber":"17616618","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"106-3114-E-002-005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Cost Optimization in Dynamic Placement of Virtualized Network Function Chains","sourcePdf":"tnsm-wu-2782370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094964S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"8310716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8310716","articleId":"8187671","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8187679,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Xiao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, China","Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8338166/8187679/xiao-2782726-small.gif","p":["Liang Xiao (M\u201909\u2013SM\u201913) received the B.S. degree in\n communication engineering from the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2000, the\n M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in\n electrical engineering from Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA, in 2009.

In this paper, the power allocation of a base station in a NOMA system equipped with multiple antennas contending with a smart jammer is formulated as a zero-sum game, in which the base station as the leader first chooses the transmit power on multiple antennas, while a jammer as the follower selects the jamming power to interrupt the transmission of the users. A Stackelberg equilibrium of the antijamming NOMA transmission game is derived and conditions assuring its existence are provided to disclose the impact of multiple antennas and radio channel states. A reinforcement learning-based power control scheme is proposed for the downlink NOMA transmission without being aware of the jamming and radio channel parameters. The Dyna architecture that formulates a learned world model from the real antijamming transmission experience and the hotbooting technique that exploits experiences in similar scenarios to initialize the quality values are used to accelerate the learning speed of the Q-learning-based power allocation, and thus, improve the communication efficiency of the NOMA transmission in the presence of smart jammers. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly increase the sum data rates of users, and thus, the utilities compared with the standard Q-learning-based strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2782726","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8338166/08187679.pdf","startPage":"3377","endPage":"3389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8338166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2782726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning-Based NOMA Power Allocation in the Presence of Smart Jamming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning-Based NOMA Power Allocation in the Presence of Smart Jamming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187679/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17699037","htmlLink":"/document/8187679/","volume":"67","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671396 and 91638204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1420575, CNS-1456793, ECCS-1307949 and EARS-1444009"},{"fundingName":"National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2018D08"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning-Based NOMA Power Allocation in the Presence of Smart Jamming","sourcePdf":"tvt-xiao-2782726-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142454S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8338166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"8338166","articleId":"8187679","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8187689,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Liu","affiliation":["State Key Lab of Intelligent Technologies and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology (TNList), Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8635405/8187689/liu-2782709-small.gif","p":["Hao Liu received the B.S. degree in software engineering from Sichuan University, China, in 2011, and the M.E. degree in computer technology from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, China in 2014.

Unlike conventional hand-crafted feature-based methods that require prior and expert knowledge, we propose an ordinal deep feature learning (ODFL) method to learn feature descriptors for face representation directly from raw pixels. Motivated by the fact that age labels are chronologically correlated and age estimation is an ordinal learning problem, our proposed ODFL enforces two criteria on the descriptors, which are learned at the top of the deep networks: 1) the topology-preserving ordinal relation is employed to exploit the order information in the learned feature space and 2) the age-difference cost information is leveraged to dynamically measure face pairs with different age value gaps. However, both the procedures of feature extraction and age estimation are learned independently in ODFL, which may lead to a sub-optimal problem. To address this, we further propose an end-to-end ordinal deep learning (ODL) framework, where the complementary information of both the procedures is exploited to reinforce our model. Extensive experimental results on five face aging datasets show that both our ODFL and ODL achieve superior performance in comparisons with most state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2782709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2782709","startPage":"486","endPage":"501","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8635405/08187689.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8635405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ordinal Deep Learning for Facial Age Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Ordinal Deep Learning for Facial Age Estimation","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2019","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8187689/","accessionNumber":"18433566","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187689/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672306, 61572271 and 61527808"},{"fundingName":"National 1000 Young Talents Plan Program"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB349304"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20120002110033"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Fundamental Research Fund (Subject Arrangement)","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170412170438636"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Tsinghua University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ordinal Deep Learning for Facial Age Estimation","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lu-2782709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146265S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8635405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8635405","articleId":"8187689","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8187690,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Mohajertehrani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8355985/8187690/mohaj-2769685-small.gif","p":["Maryam Mohajertehrani received B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Tehran Branch of Azad University (Iran) in 2011.

The avionics industry is exploring new schemes to minimize the number of power and data cables to build lighter, more reliable and fuel-efficient aircrafts. In this paper, we describe a novel integrated power harvesting interface to procure power required for avionic sensors. The implemented power harvesting approach is based on a modified power over Ethernet scheme in which the power in the ARINC 825 field (data) bus during its idle times serves as the source for the power conversion chain. A transistor-level design is carried out in CMOSP 0.35 \u03bcm (AMS) 3.3 V/5 V technology and the system performance is investigated under various conditions to improve its efficiency. From the experimental tests, an overall efficiency of 60 % was achieved and the harvesting device provided an output power of 10.08 mW for feeding sensors. Reported experimental results proved that the proposed power recovery scheme could serve as a power recovery unit to supply embedded sensors.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2769685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8355985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2769685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8355985/08187690.pdf","startPage":"2048","endPage":"2057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harvesting Energy From Aviation Data Lines: Implementation and Experimental Results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Harvesting Energy From Aviation Data Lines: Implementation and Experimental Results","volume":"65","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8187690/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17752526","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187690/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Strategic grant program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007034","fundingName":"Thales Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harvesting Energy From Aviation Data Lines: Implementation and Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"tcsi-mohajertehrani-2769685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100744S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8355985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8355985","articleId":"8187690","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8187697,"authors":[{"name":"Chiranjib Saha","affiliation":["Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8359223/8187697/saha-2782741-small.gif","p":["Chiranjib Saha (S\u201917) received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from Jadavpur University, India, in 2015.

This is directly reflected in the HetNet simulation models proposed by standardization bodies, such as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). Complementary to these simulation models, stochastic geometry-based approach, modeling the locations of the users, and the K tiers of BSs as independent and homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs), has gained prominence in the past few years. Despite its success in revealing useful insights, this PPP-based K-tier HetNet model is not rich enough to capture spatial coupling between user and BS locations that exists in real-world HetNet deployments and is included in 3GPP simulation models. In this paper, we demonstrate that modeling a fraction of users and arbitrary number of BS tiers alternatively with a Poisson cluster process (PCP) captures the aforementioned coupling, thus bridging the gap between the 3GPP simulation models and the PPP-based analytic model for HetNets. We further show that the downlink coverage probability of a typical user under maximum signal-tointerference-ratio (SIR) association can be expressed in terms of the sum-product functionals over PPP, PCP, and its associated offspring point process, which are all characterized as a part of our analysis. We also show that the proposed model converges to the PPP-based HetNet model as the cluster size of the PCPs tends to infinity. Finally, we specialize our analysis based on general PCPs for Thomas and Mat\u00e9rn cluster processes. Special instances of the proposed model closely resemble the different configurations for BS and user locations considered in 3GPP simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2782741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8359223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2782741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8359223/08187697.pdf","startPage":"2219","endPage":"2234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3GPP-Inspired HetNet Model Using Poisson Cluster Process: Sum-Product Functionals and Downlink Coverage","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8359223/8187697-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"3GPP-Inspired HetNet Model Using Poisson Cluster Process: Sum-Product Functionals and Downlink Coverage","volume":"66","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8187697/","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17766431","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187697/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1464293 and CNS-1617896"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"3GPP-Inspired HetNet Model Using Poisson Cluster Process: Sum-Product Functionals and Downlink Coverage","sourcePdf":"tcomm-dhillon-2782741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174678S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8359223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"8359223","articleId":"8187697","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8187705,"authors":[{"name":"Abhaykumar Kumbhar","affiliation":["Motorola Solutions, Inc., Plantation, FL, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Abhaykumar Kumbhar received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University, India, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in computer science from Villanova University in 2011.

Recently, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has received extensive interest for PSC to fill the coverage holes and establish reliable connectivity. The UAVs can be deployed as unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) as part of a heterogeneous network (HetNet) PSC infrastructure. In this paper, we design a PSC LTE-Advanced HetNet for different path loss models and deployment mechanism for UABSs. We enhance the system-wide spectral efficiency (SE) of this PSC HetNet by apply cell range expansion (CRE) to UABSs and mitigating the inter-cell interference arising in the HetNet by applying 3GPP Release-10 enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) and 3GPP Release-11 further-enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (FeICIC). Through Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the system-wide fifth percentile SE when UABSs are deployed on a hexagonal grid and when their locations are optimized using a genetic algorithm, while also jointly optimizing the CRE and the inter-cell interference coordination parameters. Our results show that at optimized UABS locations, reduced power subframes defined in 3GPP Release-11 can provide considerably better fifth percentile SE than the 3GPP Release-10 with almost blank subframes (eICIC).","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2776120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2776120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08187705.pdf","startPage":"783","endPage":"796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting LTE-Advanced HetNets and FeICIC for UAV-Assisted Public Safety Communications","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6287639/8274985/8187705-aam.pdf","topic":"Mission Critical Public-Safety Communications: Architectures, Enabling Technologies, and Future Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting LTE-Advanced HetNets and FeICIC for UAV-Assisted Public Safety Communications","volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17542720","htmlLink":"/document/8187705/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"AST-1443999 and CNS-1453678"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Exploiting LTE-Advanced HetNets and FeICIC for UAV-Assisted Public Safety Communications","sourcePdf":"access-kumbhar-2776120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089332S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Mission Critical Public-Safety Communications: Architectures, Enabling Technologies, and Future Applications"],"articleId":"8187705","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8187707,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/8610330/8187707/li-2776018-small.gif","p":["Wei Li (M\u201911) received the B.S. degree in electric and information engineering from Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2009.","From September 2015 to October 2016, she visited the University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA.

This paper conducts a thorough investigation of preamble detection in adverse underwater acoustic channels in the presence of various external interference, such as narrowband interference, impulsive noise, partial-band partial-block-duration interference, and chirps from nearby systems-The Gaussian noise model is not sufficient. We propose two novel detection methods based on the inherent sparsity of underwater acoustic channels: The first method declares signal detection when a sparse signal reconstruction is successful, whereas the second method accumulates the correlation coefficients from multiple paths instead of just the strongest path. We study the performance of the proposed methods based on simulations and experimental data sets, where the detection thresholds are empirically obtained. Performance results testify to the clear advantages of the proposed detection methods relative to existing matched-filter based approaches in various interference conditions.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2017.2776018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8610330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2017.2776018","endPage":"268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/8610330/08187707.pdf","startPage":"256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preamble Detection for Underwater Acoustic Communications Based on Sparse Channel Identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187707/","displayDocTitle":"Preamble Detection for Underwater Acoustic Communications Based on Sparse Channel Identification","volume":"44","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18402203","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8187707/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen Municipal Government in Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"JCYJ20150403161923507 and JCYJ20150928162348560"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Plan of Shenzhen Municipal Government in Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"JCYJ20150403161923507 and JCYJ20150928162348560"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preamble Detection for Underwater Acoustic Communications Based on Sparse Channel Identification","sourcePdf":"joe-li-2776018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127088S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"8610330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8610330","articleId":"8187707","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8187723,"authors":[{"name":"Lingxiao Jiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8306523/8187723/jiao-2778108-small.gif","p":["Lingxiao Jiao received the B.Eng. degree in electronic science and technology from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include microwave components and wireless transceiver systems."]},"firstName":"Lingxiao","lastName":"Jiao","orcid":"0000-0002-7000-4280","id":"37085458734"},{"name":"Yongle Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8306523/8187723/wu-2778108-small.gif","p":["Yongle Wu (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering and Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","In 2010, he was a Research Assistant with the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

The hybrid beamformer is comprised of a baseband digital beamformer and a constant modulus analog beamformer in the radio frequency (RF) part of the system. As in singular-value-decomposition (SVD)-based beamforming, hybrid beamforming design aims to generate parallel data streams in multi-antenna systems, however, due to the constant modulus constraint of the analog beamformer, the problem cannot be solved similarly. To address this problem, mathematical expressions of the parallel data streams are derived in this paper and desired and interfering signals are specified per stream. The analog beamformers are designed by maximizing the power of desired signal while minimizing the sum-power of interfering signals. Finally, digital beamformers are derived by defining the equivalent channel observed by the transmitter/receiver. Regardless of the number of the antennas or type of channel, the proposed approach can be applied to a wide range of MIMO systems with hybrid structure wherein the number of the antennas is more than the number of the RF chains. In particular, the proposed algorithm is verified for sparse channels that emulate mm-wave transmission as well as rich scattering environments. In order to validate the optimality, the results are compared with those of the state-of-the-art and it is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, regardless of type of the channel and/or system configuration.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8309484/08187725.pdf","startPage":"1445","endPage":"1459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2778258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2778258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8309484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity and Robust Hybrid Beamforming Design for Multi-Antenna Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Radio frequency","MIMO","Array signal processing","Complexity theory","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interfering signals","digital beamformers","MIMO systems","robust hybrid beamforming design","multiantenna communication systems","hybrid beamformer","baseband digital beamformer","constant modulus analog beamformer","singular-value-decomposition","parallel data streams","multiantenna systems","constant modulus constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid beamforming","millimetre wave","MAssive MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity and Robust Hybrid Beamforming Design for Multi-Antenna Communication Systems","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8187725/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17617694","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N020391/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003513","fundingName":"University of Surrey 5GIC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity and Robust Hybrid Beamforming Design for Multi-Antenna Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-mmolu-2778258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127077S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8309484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8309484","articleId":"8187725","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8187726,"authors":[{"name":"Huanxiao Mai","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/8385584/8187726/huanx-2771413-small.gif","p":["Huanxiao Mai received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering\n from Xuchang College, Henan, China, in 2014.

Massive carrier aggregation (MCA) may help as it aggregates a large number of potentially non-contiguous carriers spanning a wide bandwidth. However, implementing MCA brings challenges to the design of the receiver and corresponding data recovery algorithms. For example, if we assign a separate receiver chain for each carrier, the number of receiver chains will be large, which imposes a huge cost. If we use a single receiver chain for all non-contiguous carriers, an expensive high rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required to sample the entire span of the carriers. To reduce the cost, we propose a receiver architecture that employs only one receiver chain with a non-uniform ADC, whose sampling rate is much smaller than the Nyquist rate, and a low cost power amplifier with small dynamic range. Under such architecture, the received signal suffers from non-linear distortion and interference, and the resulting data recovery is a challenging non-linear compressive sensing problem. We propose an algorithm to jointly mitigate the interference and recover the data, which is proved to have theoretical performance guarantees and verified advantageous over baselines in simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2778088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8288639/08187727.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2778088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8288639","startPage":"1389","endPage":"1404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Interference Mitigation and Data Recovery for Massive Carrier Aggregation via Non-Linear Compressive Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Interference Mitigation and Data Recovery for Massive Carrier Aggregation via Non-Linear Compressive Sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187727/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17561939","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8187727/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571383"},{"fundingName":"RGC","grantNumber":"16209916"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Interference Mitigation and Data Recovery for Massive Carrier Aggregation via Non-Linear Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"twc-zhu-2778088-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146122S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8288639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8288639","articleId":"8187727","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8187728,"authors":[{"name":"Runqi Chai","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Transport and Manufacturing, Cranfield University, Cranfield, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8612980/8187728/rchai-2778195-small.gif","p":["Runqi Chai (S\u201915) was born in Beijing, China, in 1993.

To decrease the sensitivity of the initial guess and enhance the stability of the algorithm, an initial guess generator based on a specific stochastic algorithm is applied. In addition, an improved gradient-based algorithm is used as the inner solver, which can offer the user more flexibility to control the optimization process. Furthermore, in order to analyze the quality of the solution, the optimality verification conditions are derived. Numerical simulations were carried out by using the proposed hybrid solver and the results indicate that the proposed strategy can have better performance in terms of convergence speed and convergence ability when compared with other typical optimal control solvers. A Monte-Carlo simulation was performed and the results show a robust performance of the proposed algorithm in dispersed conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trajectory Optimization of Space Maneuver Vehicle Using a Hybrid Optimal Control Solver","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2017.2778195","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8612980/08187728.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2017.2778195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8612980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Trajectory Optimization of Space Maneuver Vehicle Using a Hybrid Optimal Control Solver","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8187728/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2019","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18379375","pubMedId":"29990232","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory Optimization of Space Maneuver Vehicle Using a Hybrid Optimal Control Solver","sourcePdf":"tcyb-chai-2778195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085821S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8612980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8612980","articleId":"8187728","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8187729,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["Centre for Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/8329400/8187729/lin-2779849-small.gif","p":["Chin-Teng Lin received the BS degree from National Chiao Tung\n University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1986, and the master's and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from\n Purdue University, West Lafayette, indiana, in 1989 and 1992, respectively.

To cope with the skewed class distribution, many learning methods featuring minority oversampling have been proposed, which are proved to be effective. To reduce information loss during feature space projection, this study proposes a novel oversampling algorithm, named minority oversampling in kernel adaptive subspaces (MOKAS), which exploits the invariant feature extraction capability of a kernel version of the adaptive subspace self-organizing maps. The synthetic instances are generated from well-trained subspaces and then their pre-images are reconstructed in the input space. Additionally, these instances characterize nonlinear structures present in the minority class data distribution and help the learning algorithms to counterbalance the skewed class distribution in a desirable manner. Experimental results on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed MOKAS is capable of modeling complex data distribution and outperforms a set of state-of-the-art oversampling algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Kernel","Self-organizing feature maps","Data models","Machine learning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","sampling methods","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning methods","feature space projection","invariant feature extraction capability","adaptive subspace self-organizing maps","minority class data distribution","skewed class distribution","complex data distribution","class imbalance problem","machine learning","learning bias","majority classes","information loss reduction","minority oversampling in kernel adaptive subspaces","MOKAS","synthetic instances","nonlinear structures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class imbalance","adaptive subspace self-organizing maps","kernel","minority oversampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2017.2779849","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/8329400/08187729.pdf","startPage":"950","endPage":"962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8329400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2017.2779849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minority Oversampling in Kernel Adaptive Subspaces for Class Imbalanced Datasets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minority Oversampling in Kernel Adaptive Subspaces for Class Imbalanced Datasets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187729/","volume":"30","issue":"5","publicationDate":"1 May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8187729/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17683732","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP180100670 and DP180100656"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"W911NF-10-2-0022 and W911NF-10-D-0002/TO 0023"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minority Oversampling in Kernel Adaptive Subspaces for Class Imbalanced Datasets","sourcePdf":"tkde-chuang-2779849-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130038S","chronDate":"May 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"8329400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8329400","articleId":"8187729","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8187745,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Dua","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8357823/8187745/dua-2780183-small.gif","p":["Amit Dua (S\u201915) received the B.E. degree in computer science\n and M.S. degree in software systems from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India, in 2009 and\n 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from Thapar University, Patiala, India.\n He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Computer Science and Information System Department, BITS Pilani.

Any malicious activity has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages exchanged between different vehicles. To ensure secure message communication among the vehicles in a smart city environment, a novel scheme using elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) technique has been presented in this paper. For this purpose, a two-level authentication key exchange scheme has been designed. In the first level authentication, CH s are verified by series of messages exchanged between CHs and the CA. The verified CHs are responsible for authentication of vehicles in the second level authentication, followed by exchange of messages between CH and vehicle. The security analysis using widely accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, formal security analysis using random oracle model and verification using the widely known automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and also the informal security analysis have been done with respect to various types of attacks. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed scheme with existing related schemes reveals that it generates low overhead and latency, and high reliability during messages exchange between vehicles and the CA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","volume":"67","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17752972","dateOfInsertion":"11 May 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8187745/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secure Message Communication Protocol Among Vehicles in Smart City","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Message Communication Protocol Among Vehicles in Smart City","sourcePdf":"tvt-kumar-2780183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211988S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8357823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"8357823","articleId":"8187745","onlineDate":"12 December 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8187756,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Elsayed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Dept., Qatar University"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elsayed","id":"37411474000"},{"name":"Ahmed Badawy","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Dept., Qatar University","Politecnico di Torino - DET"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Badawy","id":"38108336300"},{"name":"Massudi Mahmuddin","affiliation":["Computer Science and Computer Engineering Dept., Qatar University"],"firstName":"Massudi","lastName":"Mahmuddin","id":"37847084700"},{"name":"Tarek Elfouly","affiliation":["Qatar University, Doha, Ad Dawhah, QA"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Elfouly"},{"name":"Amr Mohamed","affiliation":["Computer Science and Computer Engineering Dept., Qatar University"],"firstName":"Amr","lastName":"Mohamed","id":"37290677400"},{"name":"Khalid Abualsaud","affiliation":["Qatar University, Doha, Ad Dawhah, QA"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Abualsaud"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1626-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1625-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1627-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8187756","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Discrete wavelet transforms","Field programmable gate arrays","Data compression","Distortion","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","body area networks","body sensor networks","data compression","discrete wavelet transforms","electrocardiography","electroencephalography","field programmable gate arrays","health care","medical signal processing","patient monitoring","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sustainable energy-efficient hardware platforms","EEG data compression","transmission power","complete hardware model","hardware compression","reconstruction model","DWT threshold","vital signs","data compression","field programmable gate array","FPGA implementation","DWT compression","mHealth","discrete wavelet transform","patient mobility","monitoring devices","continuous patient monitoring","mobile health","wireless body sensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WBSN","FPGA","EEG","ECG"]}],"abstract":"Wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) provide an appreciable aid to patients who require continuous care and monitoring. One key application of WBSN is mobile health (mHealth) for continuous patient monitoring, acquiring vital signs e.g. EEG, ECG, etc. Such monitoring devices are doomed to be portable, i.e., batter powered, and agile to allow for patient mobility, while providing sustainable, energy-efficient hardware platforms. Hence, EEG data compression is critical in reducing the transmission power, hence increase the battery life. In this paper, we design and implement a complete hardware model based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for vital signs data compression and reconstruction on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) based platform. We evaluate the performance of our DWT compression FPGA implementation under different practical parameters including filter length and the compression ratio. We investigate the hardware and computational complexity of our design in terms of used resource blocks for future comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. Our results show the efficiency of the proposed hardware compression and reconstruction model at different system parameters, including the high pass filter coefficients, and DWT type, and DWT threshold.","doi":"10.1109/ICWISE.2016.8187756","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Conference on Wireless Sensors (ICWiSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Conference on Wireless Sensors (ICWiSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8168202/8187749/08187756.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWISE.2016.8187756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8187749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of DWT EEG data compression for wireless body sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187756/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of DWT EEG data compression for wireless body sensor networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8187756/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"17418986","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of DWT EEG data compression for wireless body sensor networks","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"021elsayed.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052158S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8168202","isNumber":"8187749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8168202","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8187749","articleId":"8187756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":8187828,"authors":[{"name":"Ayesha Kanwal","firstName":"Ayesha","lastName":"Kanwal"},{"name":"Rahat Masood","firstName":"Rahat","lastName":"Masood"},{"name":"Muhammad Awais Shibli","firstName":"Muhammad Awais","lastName":"Shibli"},{"name":"Rafia Mumtaz","firstName":"Rafia","lastName":"Mumtaz"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8187828","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["trust establishment","taxonomy of trust models","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Establishment of trust between Cloud consumers and service providers is a challenging issue, which is a major reason why organizations are reluctant to adopt the Cloud paradigm. In order to resolve this issue, various trust models have been proposed for the Cloud domain; however, none of these models are widely accepted by the industry because they only cover a few aspects of trust establishment, and do not support all the essential features. Several problems exist in the Cloud trust models, but lack of standardization and interoperability are the primary concerns. Similarly, there is no such generic and comprehensive trust model that can establish trust on all the layers of Cloud services, namely software, platform and infrastructure. Moreover, existing trust models have their limitations in terms of providing essential functionality and security features for trust evaluation. In order to provide reliable trust establishment in the Cloud environment, there is an indispensable need to carry out research and gather knowledge about the functional and non-functional features offered by the existing Cloud trust models. Comprehensive research about trust models would further help the Cloud consumers in the selection of an appropriate model, according to their security and functional requirements. In this paper, we have performed in-depth analysis of the existing trust models in the Cloud, considering the essential functional and non-functional aspects to accurately evaluate the trust of the Cloud providers. We present panoramic taxonomies covering state of the art features, which are considered critical for trust models to effectively establish and evaluate the trust between Cloud consumers and providers. Furthermore, we have applied the proposed taxonomies as assessment criteria for the analysis of various trust models in the Cloud domain. In order to effectively demonstrate the realization and use of proposed taxonomies in real life scenarios, we have presented an extensive case study about the Health Information Exchange System.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Taxonomy for Trust Models in Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","doi":"10.1093/comjnl/bxu138","displayPublicationTitle":"The Computer Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016794/8187793/08187828.pdf","startPage":"601","endPage":"626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxu138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8187793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8187828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"OUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8187828/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Taxonomy for Trust Models in Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","publicationDate":"April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Taxonomy for Trust Models in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"bxu138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026005S","chronDate":"April  2015","isNumber":"8187793","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016794","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8187828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8187841,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Cao","firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Cao"},{"name":"Wenfei Fan","firstName":"Wenfei","lastName":"Fan"},{"name":"Shuai Ma","firstName":"Shuai","lastName":"Ma"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0010-4620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1460-2067"}],"articleNumber":"8187841","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["graph pattern matching","cloud computing","virtual network mapping"]}],"abstract":"Virtual network mapping (VNM) is to build a network on demand by deploying virtual machines in a substrate network, subject to constraints on capacity, bandwidth and latency.

We establish complexity bounds of these problems for various mapping constraints, ranging from polynomial time to NP-complete. For intractable problems, we show that their optimization problems are approximation-hard, i.e. NPO-complete in general and APX-hard even for special cases.

This field can be measured remotely with a signal-to-noise ratio depending on the background noise and signal attenuation. The seismoelectric beamforming approach is an emerging imaging technique based on scanning a porous material using appropriately delayed seismic sources. The idea is to focus the hydromechanical energy on a regular spatial grid and measure the converted electric field remotely at each focus time. This method can be used to image heterogeneities with a high definition and to provide structural information to classical geophysical methods. A numerical experiment is performed to investigate the resolution of the seismoelectric beamforming approach with respect to the main wavelength of the seismic waves. The 2-D model consists of a fictitious water-filled bucket in which a cylindrical sandstone core sample is set up vertically. The hydrophones/seismic sources are located on a 50-cm diameter circle in the bucket and the seismic energy is focused on the grid points in order to scan the medium and determine the geometry of the porous plug using the output electric potential image. We observe that the resolution of the method is given by a density of eight scanning points per wavelength. Additional numerical tests were also performed to see the impact of a wrong velocity model upon the seismoelectric map displaying the heterogeneities of the material.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8188120/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2015","volume":"201","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Seismoelectric beamforming imaging: a sensitivity analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seismoelectric beamforming imaging: a sensitivity analysis","sourcePdf":"ggv117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089923S","chronDate":"April  2015","isNumber":"8188073","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8188120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8188186,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Schnaidt","firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Schnaidt"},{"name":"Graham Heinson","firstName":"Graham","lastName":"Heinson"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0956-540X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1365-246X"}],"articleNumber":"8188186","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"abstract":"Uncertainty estimation is a vital part of geophysical numerical modelling. There exist a variety of methods aimed at uncertainty estimation, which are often complicated and difficult to implement. We present an inversion technique that produces multiple solutions, based on bootstrap resampling, to create a qualitative uncertainty measure for 2-D magnetotelluric inversion models. The approach is easy to implement, can be used with almost any inversion code, and does not require access to the inversion software's source code. It is capable of detecting the effect of data uncertainties on the model result rather than just analysing the effect of model variations on the model response. To obtain uncertainty estimates for an inversion model, the original data set is resampled repeatedly and alternate data set realizations are created and inverted. This ensemble of solutions is then statistically analysed to determine the variability between the different solutions. The process yields interpretable uncertainty maps for the inversion model and we demonstrate its effectiveness to qualitatively quantify uncertainty in synthetic model tests and a case study.","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Instability analysis","Inverse theory","Magnetotellurics"]}],"doi":"10.1093/gji/ggv264","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8188181/08188186.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8188181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggv264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bootstrap resampling as a tool for uncertainty analysis in 2-D magnetotelluric inversion modelling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8188186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","displayDocTitle":"Bootstrap resampling as a tool for uncertainty analysis in 2-D magnetotelluric inversion modelling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8188186/","volume":"203","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bootstrap resampling as a tool for uncertainty analysis in 2-D magnetotelluric inversion modelling","sourcePdf":"ggv264.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022498S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","isNumber":"8188181","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","articleId":"8188186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8188545,"authors":[{"name":"Samirah Mohd Razali","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Samirah Mohd","lastName":"Razali","id":"37085439111"},{"name":"Kamaruddin Mamat","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Kamaruddin","lastName":"Mamat","id":"37666362800"},{"name":"Nor Shahniza Kamal Bashah","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, MY"],"firstName":"Nor Shahniza Kamal","lastName":"Bashah"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1626-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1625-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1627-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8188545","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"abstract":"The deployment of high densities of node due to the advancement in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology had created the concern regarding the lifetime and error presented in the network. From the previous studies, Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) error control techniques can combat errors and indirectly, can reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes. Based on the latest previous work, the HARQ algorithm was not able to combat the issue of interference levels properly that rises to Coded Division Multiple Access (CDMA). Not to mention, the implementation of high error correcting capabilities of Error Correcting Codes (ECC) in the module of HARQ on the unconducive environment will cause additional overhead. Thus, the problem regarding the interference and overhead in WSN becomes our motivation to research a better HARQ error control algorithm that follows the process of convectional Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) and Forward Error Correction (FEC) with network condition estimation in CDMA WSN. This paper evaluated the different type of error correction schemes and existing HARQ over different Bit Length and Node Densities. This paper had demonstrated that as the network get congested, the error rates will get increased. The congested network had also increased the energy consumption that will shorter the lifetime of the network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Conference on Wireless Sensors

around the world, domestic birds are a major threat in the field of agriculture causing damage to economic field crops, storage houses and also dirtying human life areas. Such most common pest birds in many countries are House crows (Corvus), Common myna, Jungle myna, Brahminy starling, White-cheeked bulbul, Acridotterestritis etc. In order to distract these birds away, many traditional methods such as Scarecrow models, Hawk kites, Coloured lights, Lasers, Flashes, Chemicals etc are used which nowadays do not seem very effective. In this paper an effective bird deterrent technique i.e. Solar Powered Audible Bird Scarer has been developed. Different sounds due to which different species of birds get deterred were also noticed and studied.

The occurrence of an arc flash is the most serious fault within a power system. The destructive impact of an arc flash event can lead to severe injuries to operating personnel, costly damage to the switchgear, and to long outages of the system. Active arc elimination systems can mitigate the above-named consequences. They extinguish an internal arc by redirecting the uncontrolled energy release into a defined and controlled bolted connection of all 3 phases to earth potential. Arc elimination devices are designed to detect and quench a burning internal arc in less than one third of a cycle and therefore offer the highest degree of protection for personnel and equipment. This paper encompasses the highlights of OSHA's Final Rule (forecasted to save 20 lives annually) that became a law in July, 2014 and a general overview of different arc flash protection devices available on the market.

Distributed DC systems take advantage of a number of advanced technologies to allow for weight/space savings, reduced vessel operating costs, and enhanced protection and automation systems. System designers can take advantage of the best of both AC and DC system technologies by using commercially proven off the shelf AC electrical equipment connected via advanced power electronic converters to a distributed DC distribution system.

Companies' and services' owners strive to balance between the required reliability and redundancy level to efficiently manage their businesses. Thus, data center maintenance becomes a vital task for data center managers, to ensure achieving equipment maximum performance and reliability level. These maintenance tasks - which encompass many breakers' switching activities for high voltage and low voltage electrical systems - will expose operators to a high risk of an arc flash incident, where rapid release of electrical energy will occur, due to arcing fault between electrical phases, neutral or ground, resulting in extremely high temperature, a powerful pressure blast, and shrapnel hurling at very high velocity. This paper will discuss the calculated arc flash energy levels in one of the largest data centers in Saudi Arabia, and the implemented mitigation techniques: installation of permanent thermal infrared (IR) sensors in critical electrical joints to properly identify any loose joints at an early stage (30% loading), prior to stressing them during maintenance switching activity; installation of arc flash maintenance switches in Low-Voltage breakers, to minimize the arc fault clearing time, through instantaneously operating the protection devices in those breakers; and remote switching via the site Electrical Power Management System (EPMS), to ensure keeping the operators at a safe working distance away from the arc flash hazards. The outcome of this paper is to share the arc flash levels before and after the implementation of the mitigation techniques, as well as the details of implementing these initiatives.","doi":"10.1109/ICEPE-ST.2017.8188992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8188783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPE-ST.2017.8188992","publicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Electric Power Equipment - Switching Technology (ICEPE-ST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 4th International Conference on Electric Power Equipment - Switching Technology (ICEPE-ST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8125073/8188783/08188992.pdf","startPage":"951","endPage":"956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arc flash mitigation initiatives in data centers electrical substations: A case study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Arc flash mitigation initiatives in data centers electrical substations: A case study","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8188992/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17429456","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8188992/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arc flash mitigation initiatives in data centers electrical substations: A case study","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"HO1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114371S","chronDate":"22-25 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8125073","isNumber":"8188783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8125073","xplore-issue":"8188783","articleId":"8188992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8189125,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander V.

For this purpose, we first applied state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithm called Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) to identify low-misfit regions of the model space. These regions were then randomly sampled to create an ensemble of equivalent models and quantify uncertainty. CMAES is aimed at exploring model space globally and is robust on very ill-conditioned problems. We show that the number of iterations required to converge grows at a moderate rate with respect to number of unknowns and the algorithm is embarrassingly parallel. We formulated the problem by using the generalized Gaussian distribution. This enabled us to seamlessly use arbitrary norms for residual and regularization terms. We show that various regularization norms facilitate studying different classes of equivalent solutions. We further show how performance of the standard Metropolis\u2013Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm can be substantially improved by using information CMAES provides.

This method can be used to extract signals of interest embedded in teleseismic measurements recorded by regional seismic arrays. We pose the problem of enhancing the resolution of the LRT as an inverse problem formulated in the frequency domain and solved according to a CS framework. We show how irregularity in the measurements along with sparsity constraints can be used to reach very compact and meaningful representations in the Radon domain, offering a benefit for both signal isolation and spatial interpolation during data reconstruction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its benefits on both synthetic and USArray seismograms. This CS-based version of the LRT presents a valuable tool relevant for both global and exploration seismic processing, and which can be used as a basis for signal enhancement techniques exploiting irregularly sampled data.","doi":"10.1093/gji/ggw307","publicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","displayPublicationTitle":"Geophysical Journal International","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016795/8189319/08189334.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8189319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compressive sensing approach to the high-resolution linear Radon transform: application on teleseismic wavefields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8189334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8189334/","displayDocTitle":"A compressive sensing approach to the high-resolution linear Radon transform: application on teleseismic wavefields","volume":"207","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compressive sensing approach to the high-resolution linear Radon transform: application on teleseismic wavefields","sourcePdf":"ggw307.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022422S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","isNumber":"8189319","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016795","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8189334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8189496,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Sekaj","firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Sekaj"},{"name":"Vojtech Vesely","firstName":"Vojtech","lastName":"Vesely"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0265-0754"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1471-6887"}],"articleNumber":"8189496","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8189496","keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robust controller","linear systems","genetic algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1093/imamci/dni022","pdfPath":"/iel7/8016798/8189492/08189496.pdf","publicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information","displayPublicationTitle":"IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information","startPage":"257","endPage":"265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8189492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1093/imamci/dni022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust output feedback controller design: genetic algorithm approach","abstract":"This paper proposes guaranteed cost design of robust output feedback controller for continuous linear parametric uncertain systems. New necessary and sufficient conditions for static output feedback stabilizability of linear continuous time systems underlie the design procedure. Proposed algorithms are computationally simple and tightly connected with the Lyapunov stability theory and the LQR optimal state feedback design. The proposed approach allows prescription of the structure of the output feedback gain matrix (including the decentralized one) by the designer. The new design method proposed in this paper exploits a genetic algorithm to design a robust controller with guaranteed cost for polytopic linear continuous time systems. A numerical example is given to illustrate the performance of the proposed robust controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"OUP","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8189496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust output feedback controller design: genetic algorithm approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust output feedback controller design: genetic algorithm approach","sourcePdf":"dni022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028932S","chronDate":"Sept.  2005","isNumber":"8189492","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8016798","citationCount":"21","articleId":"8189496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"OUP","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8189531,"authors":[{"name":"Ekaterina Komendantskaya","firstName":"Ekaterina","lastName":"Komendantskaya"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1367-0751"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1368-9894"}],"articleNumber":"8189531","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"abstract":"We show that the conventional first-order algorithm of unification can be simulated by finite artificial neural networks with one layer of neurons.
