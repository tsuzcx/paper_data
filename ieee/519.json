K-means is a greedy algorithm, which is sensitive to the choice of cluster center and very easily results in local optimization. Genetic algorithm is a global convergence algorithm, which can find the best cluster centers easily. Among the traditional document clustering methods, the document similar matrix is a sparse matrix. In this paper, we propose some new formulas improved on the traditional method. Then, we make some improvement on genetic algorithm. All individuals are encoded by floating-point number and the sum of mean square deviation of intra-class distance is adopted as the objective function. The steps of the algorithm are given in detail. The experimental results show that the accuracy of GA can reach over 98 percent and generate better clustering result than K-means.","doi":"10.1109/ITCS.2009.269","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Technology and Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5190001/5190002/05190037.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Technology and Computer Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITCS.2009.269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Genetic Algorithm in Document Clustering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Computer science","Greedy algorithms","Clustering methods","Sparse matrices","Information technology","Application software","Sun","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document handling","genetic algorithms","greedy algorithms","number theory","pattern clustering","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document clustering","genetic algorithm","greedy algorithm","local optimization","global convergence algorithm","document similar matrix","sparse matrix","encoding","floating-point number","mean square deviation","intra-class distance","objective function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","Document Clustering","Optimal Cluster Center"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Application of Genetic Algorithm in Document Clustering","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5190037/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"25-26 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10804739","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Genetic Algorithm in Document Clustering","confLoc":"Kiev, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"3688a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066656S","chronDate":"25-26 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5190001","isNumber":"5190002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5190001","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5190002","articleId":"5190037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5190087,"authors":[{"name":"Fang Wang","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37896956900"},{"name":"Yuru Xu","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yuru","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536009000"},{"name":"Lei Wan","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wan","id":"37398492700"},{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"37538229600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3688-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5190087","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Underwater vehicles","Motion control","Remotely operated vehicles","Fuzzy sets","Mathematical model","Automotive engineering","Oceans","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fuzzy control","motion control","neurocontrollers","remotely operated vehicles","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified learning","T-S fuzzy neural network control","autonomous underwater vehicles","fuzzy rules","BP algorithm","motion control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["underwater vehicles","motion control","improved T-S fuzzy model","modified learning","fuzzy neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190087","abstract":"In this paper, an improved Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) based on modified learning is proposed for the motion control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV).

Therefore, surface coarse registration and matching can be dealt with in low-dimensional space. Using a database of 61 3D face models with 327 partial scans, several experiments have been implemented for recognition under different pose, expression changes and occlusion data.

Although, by way of sphere-constrained searching, sphere decoding algorithm and some other methods are able to greatly decrease the detection complexity as compared with that of maximum likelihood algorithm. In order to further decrease the decoding complexity, a new detection algorithm which is based on both sphere decoding method and zero forcing algorithm is put forward. The combinational detector decodes according to the signal-noise-ratio. When the signal-noise-ratio is high enough, it simply outputs the zero forcing detection results, which leads to a faster detecting process. Some simulation results show that the performance of such combinational algorithm has little difference as compared with that of sphere decoding algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An MIMO-CDMA Detection Method via Sphere Decoding and Zero Forcing Algorithm","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Technology and Computer Science","doi":"10.1109/ITCS.2009.181","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Information Technology and Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5190001/5190167/05190217.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITCS.2009.181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"An MIMO-CDMA Detection Method via Sphere Decoding and Zero Forcing Algorithm","conferenceDate":"25-26 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5190217/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10804906","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MIMO-CDMA Detection Method via Sphere Decoding and Zero Forcing Algorithm","confLoc":"Kiev, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"3688b209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044039S","chronDate":"25-26 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5190001","isNumber":"5190167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5190001","xplore-issue":"5190167","articleId":"5190217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5190253,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Guangming","affiliation":["China Satellite Maritime Telemetry and Telecontrol Department, Jiangyin, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Guangming","id":"37588186000"},{"name":"Zhu Weikang","affiliation":["China Satellite Maritime Telemetry and Telecontrol Department, Jiangyin, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Weikang","id":"37998633300"},{"name":"Dai Min","affiliation":["China Satellite Maritime Telemetry and Telecontrol Department, Jiangyin, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Dai","lastName":"Min","id":"37637488500"},{"name":"He Jianwei","affiliation":["China Satellite Maritime Telemetry and Telecontrol Department, Jiangyin, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Jianwei","id":"37544326200"},{"name":"Fang Xinbin","affiliation":["China Satellite Maritime Telemetry and Telecontrol Department, Jiangyin, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Xinbin","id":"37991585400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3688-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5190253","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"abstract":"A novel transmission scheme that mixes half-duplex decode-and-forward cooperative relay transmission (RT) with direct transmission (DT) is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay channels.

The proposed structure consists of four main units: Multi-pipeline control unit (MPCU), process element unit (PEU), region summing unit (RSU), and recognition indexing unit (RIU). Four recognition techniques: Principal component analysis (PCA), modular PCA (MPCA), Weight MPCA (WMPCA), and Wavelet based techniques are adopted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed architecture using several standard face databases. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture helps minimizing processing time through its multi-pipeline processes while still maintains high recognition rate. Moreover, the design has encouraged the reduction in hardware resources by utilizing the proposed reusable modules.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Digital Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5190501/5190502/05190553.pdf","startPage":"152","endPage":"156","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Digital Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDIP.2009.48","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIP.2009.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-pipeline Architecture for Face Recognition on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Field programmable gate arrays","Principal component analysis","Hardware","Lighting","Digital images","Process control","Indexing","Wavelet analysis","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","field programmable gate arrays","pipeline processing","principal component analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipipeline process","face recognition","FPGA","field programmable gate array","multipipeline control unit","process element unit","region summing unit","recognition indexing unit","principal component analysis","modular PCA method","Weight MPCA method","Wavelet based-technique","face database","MPCU unit","PEU unit","RIU unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","Multi-pipeline","FPGA","PCA","MPCA","WMPCA","Performance comparison"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190553/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-pipeline Architecture for Face Recognition on FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5190553/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10805095","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-pipeline Architecture for Face Recognition on FPGA","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"3565a152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060186S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5190501","isNumber":"5190502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5190501","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5190502","articleId":"5190553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5190557,"authors":[{"name":"Manesh Kokare","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology, Nanded, India"],"firstName":"Manesh","lastName":"Kokare","id":"37269307200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3565-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5190557","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computed tomography","Image retrieval","Wavelet transforms","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Indexing","Information retrieval","Image databases","Content based retrieval","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","database indexing","image retrieval","medical image processing","tree data structures","visual databases","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CT image retrieval","tree structured cosine modulated wavelet transform","medical image characterization","medical image indexing","medical image database","computer tomography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["content based medical image retrieval","tree structured cosine modulated wavelet transform","similarity measure"]}],"abstract":"Developing methods for medical image characterization and indexing are in great demand for organizing and retrieving images from huge medical image databases.

Histogram Equalization (HE) is one of the most commonly used methods for image contrast enhancement. However, HE and most other contrast enhancement methods may produce unnatural looking images. The images obtained by these methods are not suitable to use in applications such as consumer electronic products where brightness preservation is necessary to avoid annoying artifacts. To solve such problems, we proposed a novel and efficient contrast enhancement method based on genetic algorithm in this paper. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed genetic method was stronger than counterpart methods in terms of contrast and detail enhancement and producing natural looking images.

The core concept is to ensure a fast and memory efficient dedicated hardware which could increase the efficiency manifolds and enhance the overall output, thereby making real time detection and tracking possible at much higher rates than achievable using C++. The design was simulated using Xilinx ISE Simulator and ModelSim. An embedded system was later on developed for complete implementation of Image Coprocessor on FPGA, using Xilinx embedded development Kit. Six modules including edge image, Bhattacharya coefficient, histograms, Epanechnikov kernel, translation and rotation have been implemented on FPGA, and a comparison has been made with their implementation in C++. The results demonstrate up to 66 times improved performance of these individual modules. Thus, an efficient image coprocessor has been developed.","doi":"10.1109/ICDIP.2009.81","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Digital Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Digital Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5190501/5190502/05190607.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIP.2009.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190502","startPage":"220","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Coprocessor: A Real-Time Approach Towards Object Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image Coprocessor: A Real-Time Approach Towards Object Tracking","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190607/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10805143","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5190607/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Coprocessor: A Real-Time Approach Towards Object Tracking","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"3565a220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037103S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5190501","isNumber":"5190502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5190501","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5190502","articleId":"5190607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5190608,"authors":[{"name":"Rabia Khan","affiliation":["College of Signals, National University of Science and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rabia","lastName":"Khan","id":"37996650600"},{"name":"Abdul Ghafoor","affiliation":["College of Signals, National University of Science and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Abdul","lastName":"Ghafoor","id":"37287131200"},{"name":"Naveed Iqbal Rao","affiliation":["College of Signals, National University of Science and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Naveed Iqbal","lastName":"Rao","id":"37593731100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3565-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5190608","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Robustness","Low pass filters","Filtering","Digital images","Transmitters","Tin","Copyright protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","feature extraction","image coding","watermarking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind image adaptive watermarking scheme","wavelet transform","audio watermarking","image texture","image decomposition","Daubechies wavelet basis","extraction procedure","original host image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image watermarking","audio watermarking","wavelet decomposition"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for robust audio watermarking in image using wavelet transform based on an image texture. The algorithm is based on decomposition of images using Daubechies wavelet basis. The technique proposed in this paper resolves the problem of severe distortion caused by watermarking audio in an image by developing a scaling function that achieves maximum robustness and transparency prior to its embedding. The property of texture is used as a criterion to identify the target area for embedding the watermark. The security of the algorithm is enhanced by performing a random permutation of the watermark. The random arrangement of the indices serves as a secret key. This technique is a blind watermarking scheme and the extraction procedure can be performed without the original host image.The experimental results demonstrate that watermark is imperceptible and prevents audio file from audible distortion.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Blind Image Adaptive Watermarking Scheme for Audio Using Wavelet Transform","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Digital Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDIP.2009.47","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Digital Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5190501/5190502/05190608.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"71","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIP.2009.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Blind Image Adaptive Watermarking Scheme for Audio Using Wavelet Transform","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5190608/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10805144","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Blind Image Adaptive Watermarking Scheme for Audio Using Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"3565a067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072742S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5190501","isNumber":"5190502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5190501","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5190502","articleId":"5190608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5190638,"authors":[{"name":"Wattana Viriyasitavat","affiliation":["Information Technology Division, Department of Statistics, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Wattana","lastName":"Viriyasitavat","id":"37062884500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3708-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-3818"}],"articleNumber":"5190638","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access control","Costs","Information technology","Statistics","Collaborative work","Web services","Runtime","Permission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global dynamic interoperation","service workflow","service sharing","holistic requirement-based trust framework","access control policy mapping","interoperation domain","service distribution","service delegation","hierarchical elementary net system","trust propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service Composition","Service Delegation","Trust Model","Trust Propagation","Service Workflow"]}],"abstract":"Exponentially growing of global dynamic interoperation in service workflow requires promising mechanisms and processes to establish trust relationship among entities involved. The information and service sharing on each domain has different set of policies and requirements. In order to provide in place mechanisms to allow previously unknown entities to cooperate or participate in a workflow, the holistic Requirement-Based Trust Framework that facilitates interacting domains through access control policy mapping between interoperating domains has been proposed. However, trust negotiation and establishment processes including policies and roles integration are very costly and sophisticated, especially when more than two domains are involved in the interoperation. In this paper, we propose the model to depict the trust propagation for service distribution and service delegation based on Hierarchical Elementary Net System (HENS) called HENS+ applied to the Requirements-Driven Trust Framework in which the cost incurred during interoperation in many cases is reduced compared to the original framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Delegation in Requirements-Driven Trust Framework","publicationTitle":"2009 Congress on Services - I","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES-I.2009.88","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Congress on Services - I","pdfPath":"/iel5/5190624/5190625/05190638.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES-I.2009.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Delegation in Requirements-Driven Trust Framework","conferenceDate":"6-10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5190638/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10967073","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Delegation in Requirements-Driven Trust Framework","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3708a522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070374S","chronDate":"6-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5190624","isNumber":"5190625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5190624","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5190625","articleId":"5190638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5190708,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293128900"},{"name":"Guofei Jiang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Guofei","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37333652500"},{"name":"Kenji Yoshihira","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Yoshihira","id":"37586761300"},{"name":"Haifeng Chen","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281174300"},{"name":"Akhilesh Saxena","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Akhilesh","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37287158600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3708-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-3818"}],"articleNumber":"5190708","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":1555},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Internet","Load management","Computer architecture","Streaming media","Resource management","Technology management","National electric code","Laboratories","Detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commerce","customer services","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent workload factoring","cloud computing","enterprise customers","data centers","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","load balancing","workload management","randomized algorithms"]}],"abstract":"We present an intelligent workload factoring service for enterprise customers to make the best use of public cloud services along with their privately-owned (legacy) data centers.

Understanding the characteristics of computer service performance has become critical for service applications in cloud computing. For the commercial success of this new computing paradigm, the ability to deliver Quality of Services (QoS) guaranteed services is crucial. In this paper, we present an approach for studying computer service performance in cloud computing. Specifically, in an effort to deliver QoS guaranteed services in such a computing environment, we find the relationship among the maximal number of customers, the minimal service resources and the highest level of services. The obtained results provide the guidelines of computer service performance in cloud computing that would be greatly useful in the design of this new computing paradigm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Congress on Services - I","pdfPath":"/iel5/5190624/5190625/05190711.pdf","startPage":"693","endPage":"700","publicationTitle":"2009 Congress on Services - I","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES-I.2009.121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES-I.2009.121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service Performance and Analysis in Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Cloud computing","Grid computing","Quality of service","Computer science","Web and internet services","Web server","Information analysis","Business","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","online front-ends","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Web browser","computer service performance","service applications","quality of service","service resources"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Service Performance and Analysis in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5190711/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10982209","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"6-10 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service Performance and Analysis in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3708a693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130942S","chronDate":"6-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5190624","isNumber":"5190625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5190624","citationCount":"168","xplore-issue":"5190625","articleId":"5190711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5190785,"authors":[{"name":"Shawn Konecni","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Lowell, USA"],"firstName":"Shawn","lastName":"Konecni","id":"37590124000"},{"name":"Jianping Zhou","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Lowell, USA"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37933136600"},{"name":"Georges Grinstein","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Lowell, USA"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Grinstein","id":"37360588500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3733-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6037"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0138"}],"articleNumber":"5190785","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"abstract":"Lead generation library design is an iterative process of selecting compounds that would make ideal drug candidates.

This type of analysis often focuses on quantitative diagrams and emphasizes their attributes for specific tasks. Our contribution, by contrast, focuses on qualitative visual solutions and the factors that contribute to their wider diffusion. As many knowledge visualization solutions have not achieved wider use, the question of which factors foster diagram adoption seems to be a particularly relevant but under- researched topic. In this paper we develop and discuss three dimensions that foster knowledge visualization adoption: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived authority. We base our analysis on the Technology Adoption Model by Davis and the Perceived Characteristics of Innovations by Rogers. We illustrate these dimensions and their items through examples of business diagrams that have received wide recognition and we contrast them with negative examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190806/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5190806/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10805199","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Beyond Knowledge Visualization Usability: Toward a Better Understanding of Business Diagram Adoption","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Knowledge Visualization Usability: Toward a Better Understanding of Business Diagram Adoption","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"3733a474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045918S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5190764","isNumber":"5190765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5190764","xplore-issue":"5190765","articleId":"5190806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5190807,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Bertschi","affiliation":["University of Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Bertschi","id":"37567242400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3733-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6037"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0138"}],"articleNumber":"5190807","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190807","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Collaboration","Information analysis","Knowledge transfer","Testing","Heart","Mediation","Graphics","Humans","Psychology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","data visualisation","knowledge management","organisational aspects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge visualization","business analysis","metaphorical meaning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IV.2009.37","publicationTitle":"2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th International Conference Information Visualisation","pdfPath":"/iel5/5190764/5190765/05190807.pdf","startPage":"480","endPage":"485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IV.2009.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge Visualization and Business Analysis: Meaning as Media","abstract":"This paper is the third in a series of papers designed to explore how \"metaphorical meaning\" can be used to support knowledge visualization.

However, it is not straightforward to apply MOEAs to complex real-world problems. This paper discusses the major challenges we face in applying MOEAs to complex structural optimization, including the involvement of time-consuming and multi-disciplinary quality evaluation processes, changing environments, vagueness in formulating criteria formulation, and the involvement of multiple sub-systems. We propose that the successful tackling of all these aspects give birth to a systems approach to evolutionary design optimization characterized by considerations at four levels, namely, the system property level, temporal level, spatial level and process level. Finally, we suggest a few promising future research topics in evolutionary structural design that consist in the necessary steps towards a life-like design approach, where design principles found in biological systems such as self-organization, self-repair and scalability play a central role.","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/5190916/05190939.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"76","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2009.933094","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2009.933094","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190939","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Scalability","Aerodynamics","Europe","Evolutionary computation","Testing","Biological systems","Computational modeling","Thermodynamics","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary multiobjective structural optimization","multidisciplinary quality evaluation processes","life-like design approach","biological systems","evolutionary design optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"A systems approach to evolutionary multiobjective structural optimization and beyond","accessionNumber":"10805377","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5190939/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A systems approach to evolutionary multiobjective structural optimization and beyond","sourcePdf":"18-04mci03-jin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112195S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"5190916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5190916","articleId":"5190939","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5190940,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Knowles","affiliation":["University of Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Knowles","id":"37297778400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"5190940","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":774},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biochemistry","Design optimization","Analytical models","Optimization methods","Operations research","Computational intelligence","Terminology","Computational modeling","Fluid dynamics","Chemical processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","optimisation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop evolutionary multiobjective optimization","computational intelligence","evolutionary experimentation","fluid dynamics","chemical plant process optimization","evolutionary robotics research","microbiology","biochemistry applications","instrument optimization","chocolate production processes","evolutionary algorithms","design of experiments","machine learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5190940","abstract":"Artificial evolution has been used for more than 50 years as a method of optimization in engineering, operations research and computational intelligence. In closed-loop evolution (a term used by the statistician, George Box) or, equivalently, evolutionary experimentation (Ingo Rechenberg's terminology), the \"phenotypes\" are evaluated in the real world by conducting a physical experiment, whilst selection and breeding is simulated. Well-known early work on artificial evolution-design engineering problems in fluid dynamics, and chemical plant process optimization-was carried out in this experimental mode. More recently, the closed-loop approach has been successfully used in much evolvable hardware and evolutionary robotics research, and in some microbiology and biochemistry applications. In this article, several further new targets for closed-loop evolutionary and multiobjective optimization are considered. Four case studies from my own collaborative work are described: (i) instrument optimization in analytical biochemistry; (ii) finding effective drug combinations in vitro; (iii) onchip synthetic biomolecule design; and (iv) improving chocolate production processes. Accurate simulation in these applications is not possible due to complexity or a lack of adequate analytical models. In these and other applications discussed, optimizing experimentally brings with it several challenges: noise; nuisance factors; ephemeral resource constraints; expensive evaluations, and evaluations that must be done in (large) batches. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are largely equal to these vagaries, whilst modern multiobjective EAs also enable tradeoffs among conflicting optimization goals to be explored. Nevertheless, principles from other disciplines, such as statistics, design of experiments, machine learning and global optimization are also relevant to aspects of the closed-loop problem, and may inspire futher development of multiobjective EAs.","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2009.933095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/5190916/05190940.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5190916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2009.933095","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-loop evolutionary multiobjective optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5190940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Closed-loop evolutionary multiobjective optimization","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5190940/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10805376","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-loop evolutionary multiobjective optimization","sourcePdf":"19-04mci03-knowles.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138126S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"5190916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5190916","articleId":"5190940","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5191026,"authors":[{"name":"Youngsun Han","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngsun","lastName":"Han","id":"37965681100"},{"name":"Peter Harliman","affiliation":["LG Digital Media Company, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Harliman","id":"37993211300"},{"name":"Seon Wook Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seon Wook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279297600"},{"name":"Jong-Kook Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Kook","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281195500"},{"name":"Chulwoo Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chulwoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292328500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5191026","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interleaved codes","Delay","Energy consumption","Research and development","Throughput","Design methodology","Clocks","Frequency","Communication standards","Standards development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","communication complexity","interleaved codes","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block interleaving algorithm","MB-OFDM","mixed radix system","interleaving process","implementation complexity","ultra wide band communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array processor","block interleaving","MB-OFDM","Mixed Radix System (MRS)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel architecture of a block interleaver in MB-OFDM systems based on Mixed Radix System (MRS).

To reduce complexity, only tri-state buffers are acquired to build a multiphase all-digital clock management (ADCM), which can generate more than 32 phases over gigahertz without phase-locked or delay-locked loops. Following divide-and-conquer search and triangulated approximation, the phase adjustment is simple but efficient, such that four preambles are adequate to make analog-to-digital (A/D) sampling coherent. Performance evaluation indicates that the proposed ADSCD can tolerate \u00b1400-ppm clock offsets with 0.8 ~ 1.3-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) losses at 8% PER in frequency-selective fading.

The challenge here is to find a methodology that can recognize human motion patterns to reach increasingly sophisticated levels of human behavior description. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of this significant research with the emphasis on view-invariant representation, and recognition of poses and actions. In order to help readers understand the integrated process of visual analysis of human motion, this paper presents recent development in three major issues involved in a general human motion analysis system, namely, human detection, view-invariant pose representation and estimation, and behavior understanding. Public available standard datasets are recommended. The concluding discussion assesses the progress so far, and outlines some research challenges and future directions, and solution to what is essential to achieve the goals of human motion analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2027608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5314168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2027608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5314168/05191035.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advances in View-Invariant Human Motion Analysis: A Review","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Advances in View-Invariant Human Motion Analysis: A Review","volume":"40","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191035/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"10963972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191035/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advances in View-Invariant Human Motion Analysis: A Review","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-liu-2027608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138072S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5314168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5314168","articleId":"5191035","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5191039,"authors":[{"name":"Ilenia Tinnirello","affiliation":["University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5431116/5191039/5191039-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ilenia Tinnirello received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in communications in 2000 and 2004, respectively.","Since January 2005, she has been an Assistant Professor with the University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.

In this paper, we outline a number of issues and criticalities raised by previously proposed models. In particular, a careful look at backoff counter decrement rules allows us to conclude that, under saturation conditions, the slot immediately following a successful transmission can be accessed only by the station (STA) that has successfully transmitted in the previous channel access. Moreover, due to the specific acknowledgment (ACK) timeout setting adopted in the standard, the slot immediately following a collision cannot be accessed by any STA. Thus, the hypothesis of uncorrelation between consecutive channel slots and statistical homogeneity is not generally true. We propose a new backoff decrement model that retains the simplicity of traditional DCF models while being able to take into account such a correlation, and we compare the accuracy of our model with that of previously proposed approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5431116/05191039.pdf","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2029118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2029118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431116","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refinements on IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function Modeling Approaches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Media Access Protocol","Counting circuits","Wireless sensor networks","Ethernet networks","Wireless application protocol","Access protocols","Performance analysis","Wireless LAN","Collision avoidance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","telecommunication congestion control","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE 802.11 standards","distributed coordination function modeling","DCF model","saturation throughput","channel access","acknowledgment timeout setting","collision","channel slots","statistical homogeneity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backoff freezing","distributed coordination function (DCF)","performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Refinements on IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function Modeling Approaches","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5191039/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11177530","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refinements on IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function Modeling Approaches","sourcePdf":"tvt-xiao-2029118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087506S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5431116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"5431116","articleId":"5191039","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5191044,"authors":[{"name":"Sander Bakkes","affiliation":["Tilburg Centre of Creative Computing (TiCC), Faculty of Humanities, Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4804728/5200752/5191044/5191044-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sander Bakkes studied knowledge engineering at Maastricht University, The Netherlands, and graduated in 2003.

In addition, game developers are concerned that applying adaptive game AI may result in uncontrollable and unpredictable behavior (i.e., game adaptation is not reliable). These characteristics hamper the incorporation of adaptive game AI in commercially available video games. In this paper, we discuss an alternative to these current approaches. Our alternative approach to adaptive game AI has as its goal adapting rapidly and reliably to game circumstances. Our approach can be classified in the area of case-based adaptive game AI. In the approach, domain knowledge required to adapt to game circumstances is gathered automatically by the game AI, and is exploited immediately (i.e., without trials and without resource-intensive learning) to evoke effective behavior in a controlled manner in online play. We performed experiments that test case-based adaptive game AI on three different maps in a commercial real-time strategy (RTS) game. From our results, we may conclude that case-based adaptive game AI provides a strong basis for effectively adapting game AI in video games.","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2009.2029084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games","pdfPath":"/iel5/4804728/5200752/05191044.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2009.2029084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid and Reliable Adaptation of Video Game AI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191044/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Rapid and Reliable Adaptation of Video Game AI","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10816387","htmlLink":"/document/5191044/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid and Reliable Adaptation of Video Game AI","sourcePdf":"tciaig-sbakkes-2029084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098373S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4804728","isNumber":"5200752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4804728","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5200752","articleId":"5191044","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5191047,"authors":[{"name":"S.

These four dimensions can be used to create modulation formats that have a better power efficiency (higher sensitivity) than the conventional binary phase shift keying/quadrature phase shift keying (BPSK/QPSK) signals. Several examples are given, with some emphasis on a 24-level format and an 8-level format, including descriptions of how they can be realized and expressions for their symbol and bit error probabilities. These formats are, respectively, an extension and a subset of the commonly used 16-level dual-polarization QPSK format. Sphere packing simulations in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, up to 32 levels, are used to verify their optimality. The numerical results, as the number of levels increases, are shown to agree with lattice-theoretical results. Finally, we point out that the use of these constellations will lead to improved fundamental sensitivity limits for optical communication systems, and they may also be relevant as a way of reducing power demands and/or nonlinear influence.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2029064","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5235152/05191053.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2029064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235152","startPage":"5115","endPage":"5126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-Efficient Modulation Formats in Coherent Transmission Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power-Efficient Modulation Formats in Coherent Transmission Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"22","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10916399","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-Efficient Modulation Formats in Coherent Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-karlsson-2029064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2009","isNumber":"5235152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"203","articleId":"5191053","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5191054,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Chih Weng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ching-Chih","lastName":"Weng","id":"37403629300"},{"name":"P.

The linear transceiver as well as the transceiver with linear precoding and decision feedback equalization are considered. For both types of transceivers, in addition to the usual total power constraint, an individual power constraint on each antenna element is also imposed. A number of objective functions including the average bit error rate, are considered for both of the above systems under the generalized power constraint. It is shown that for both types of systems the optimization problem can be solved by first solving a class of MMSE problems (AM-MMSE or GM-MMSE depending on the type of transceiver), and then using majorization theory. The first step, under the generalized power constraint, can be formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP) for both types of transceivers, and can be solved efficiently by convex optimization tools. The second step is addressed by using results from majorization theory. The framework developed here is general enough to add any finite number of linear constraints to the covariance matrix of the input.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2029250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05191054.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2029250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","startPage":"458","endPage":"462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Transceiver Optimization With Linear Constraints on Transmitted Signal Covariance Components","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Transceiver Optimization With Linear Constraints on Transmitted Signal Covariance Components","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191054/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020541","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5191054/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Transceiver Optimization With Linear Constraints on Transmitted Signal Covariance Components","sourcePdf":"tsp-weng-2029250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07635S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5191054","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5191056,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed S.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of cooperative communications on mitigating the effect of channel estimation error and CCI. Two main performance criteria, namely, the traditional outage probability and the proposed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gap ratio, are utilized to characterize such impact. The SNR gap ratio measures the reduction in the SNR due to channel estimation error or CCI. Taking into consideration the channel estimation error, we show that the outage probability is reduced by utilizing cooperative transmission protocols. We also show that cooperative transmission scenarios, in which each cooperating relay forwards its signal over an orthogonal channel, result in lower SNR gap ratio compared to that of the direct transmission. Thus, cooperative transmission schemes are less susceptible to the effect of channel estimation error compared to direct transmission. Moreover, increasing the number of cooperating relays reduces the effect of the channel estimation error more. Timing synchronization error arises in distributed space-time cooperative schemes, in which the cooperating relays are simultaneously transmitting their signals over the same channel. Unlike the channel estimation error, the effect of the timing synchronization error gets worse as the the number of cooperating relays increases. In this work we also study the tradeoff between the timing synchronization error and the channel estimation error, and show their net impact on the system performance. Finally, we illustrate that CCI can be modeled in a similar fashion to the channel estimation error, and hence the cooperative transmission schemes are also less susceptible to the effect of CCI.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2029255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","startPage":"337","endPage":"348","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05191056.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2029255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating channel estimation error with timing synchronization tradeoff in cooperative communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Timing","Radiofrequency interference","Relays","Interchannel interference","Degradation","Wireless networks","Signal to noise ratio","Protocols","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference suppression","probability","radio networks","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing synchronization error","outage probability","signal-to-noise ratio gap ratio","wireless networks","cochannel interference","cooperative communications","timing synchronization tradeoff","channel estimation error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation error","cochannel interference (CCI)","cooperative diversity","distributed transmit beamforming","relay selection","timing synchronization error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating channel estimation error with timing synchronization tradeoff in cooperative communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191056/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5191056/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11020543","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating channel estimation error with timing synchronization tradeoff in cooperative communications","sourcePdf":"tsp-ibrahim-2029255.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078045S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5191056","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5191060,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Monzio Compagnoni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Monzio Compagnoni","id":"37284649300"},{"name":"Michele Ghidotti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Ghidotti","id":"37322811000"},{"name":"Andrea L.

Conventional long-distance radio communication techniques such as high-frequency (HF) radio, satellite, or cell phone are either too slow or too expensive to operate continuously in this situation. A microwave radio link overcomes these problems but would generally not be viable due to the limited range possible with a standard line-of-sight microwave link. This communication shows that by properly choosing the antenna height and operating frequency though, it is possible to trap signals in the ocean evaporation duct and substantially extend the propagation range. A 78-km link that operates at a frequency of 10.6 GHz and provides a data rate of 10 Mb/s has been established to verify the technique. The communication also provides preliminary results of the measured performance of this link and a comparison with existing radio propagation models.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oceans","Ducts","Microwave communication","Underwater communication","Radio link","Australia","Frequency","Radio communication","Satellite broadcasting","Artificial satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave links","microwave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ocean microwave link","ocean evaporation duct","high-capacity radio link","Australian mainland","Great Barrier Reef","North Queensland","long-distance radio communication techniques","high-frequency radio","cell phone","microwave radio link","line-of-sight microwave link","radio propagation models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Evaporation duct","high capacity link","microwave radio","over ocean propagation","sensor network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JOE.2009.2020851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/5191240/05191066.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2009.2020851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Capacity, Long-Range, Over Ocean Microwave Link Using the Evaporation Duct","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Capacity, Long-Range, Over Ocean Microwave Link Using the Evaporation Duct","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191066/","volume":"34","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191066/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10805805","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Capacity, Long-Range, Over Ocean Microwave Link Using the Evaporation Duct","sourcePdf":"joe-gwoods-2020851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04516S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"5191240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5191240","articleId":"5191066","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5191068,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The antenna, intended for use in highly integrated 60-GHz radios, is deliberately designed to exhibit capacitive input impedance to suit low-cost wire-bonding packaging and assembly technique. The antenna implemented in a thin cavity-down ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) package in low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) technology has achieved an acceptable impedance bandwidth from 59 to 65 GHz with an estimated efficiency of 94%. At millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequency 60 GHz, one of key challenges is how to realize low-loss interconnection between a radio chip and an antenna using wire-bonding technique. This paper then addresses this issue in the framework of antenna-in-package (AiP) design at 60 GHz and proposes a new solution to the challenge. Detailed wirebond design method and results are given. A major concern with AiP is the risk of the antenna coupling to the radio chip. This paper also evaluates this unwanted coupling and shows that the coupling from the in-package antenna to the on-chip inductor is lower than 30 dB for the worst case. These results clearly demonstrate the feasibility and promise of the elegant AiP technology for emerging high-speed short-range 60-GHz wireless communications.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2029290","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280586/05191068.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2029290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280586","startPage":"2842","endPage":"2852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna-in-Package Design for Wirebond Interconnection to Highly Integrated 60-GHz Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Antenna-in-Package Design for Wirebond Interconnection to Highly Integrated 60-GHz Radios","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191068/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917854","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5191068/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna-in-Package Design for Wirebond Interconnection to Highly Integrated 60-GHz Radios","sourcePdf":"57tap10-dliu-part1-2029290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104131S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5280586","articleId":"5191068","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5191069,"authors":[{"name":"Rub\u00c9n Pena","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Concepci\u00f3n, Concepcion, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/5191069/5191069-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rub\u00e9n Pe\u00f1a (S'95\u2013M'97) was born in Coronel, Chile.

The proposed scheme is implemented using an indirect matrix converter (IMC) consisting of an input stage, a three-to-two matrix converter, and two output stages consisting of a pair of voltage source inverters. The input stage is connected to the grid and provides the required dc voltage for the output stages. Space vector modulation (SVM) is used for the input stage producing the maximum dc voltage, with unity power factor operation at the IMC grid-side input. Each of the output converters is connected to the rotor of a DFIM. The rotor currents of each machine are vector controlled for fast dynamic response and tight torque control. Moreover, the SVM algorithm used for the inverters is designed to provide soft switching operation in the input converter. Simulation and experimental results obtained from a 2.5-kW experimental prototype are presented. Steady-state and transient operation is discussed with the system running at below and above synchronous speed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme for variable speed energy systems. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2028353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2028353","startPage":"4181","endPage":"4193","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/05191069.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Topology for Multiple Generation System With Doubly Fed Induction Machines and Indirect Matrix Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Topology for Multiple Generation System With Doubly Fed Induction Machines and Indirect Matrix Converter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","volume":"56","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191069/","accessionNumber":"10869388","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191069/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Topology for Multiple Generation System With Doubly Fed Induction Machines and Indirect Matrix Converter","sourcePdf":"tie-pena-2028353.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112001S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"5191069","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-02"},{"_id":5191071,"authors":[{"name":"Balduino Cezar Rabelo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Machines and Drives, Dresden University of Technology (TU Dresden), Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/5191071/5191071-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Balduino Cezar Rabelo, Jr. (M'95) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1992 and 1998, respectively.","From 1992 to 1995, he was with the Andrade Gutierrez Group, Rio Novo Mining Company, Brazil.

Despite the stochastic nature of the wind, grid reliability has to be guaranteed. In compliance with power companies' new requirements on wind turbines as regards contribution to voltage regulation, this paper proposes a reactive power controller design for doubly fed induction generator drives. This drive topology enables the control of reactive power independently of the active power flow using both rotor and mains-side inverters. This degree of freedom is used in order to share the reactive powers circulating in the drive system and resulting from the reactive power required in the network. The controllers are designed using well-known linear control techniques in order to present the same dynamics. Furthermore, the proper reactive power share can be used to enhance the drive efficiency. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed reactive power control.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2028355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/05191071.pdf","startPage":"4154","endPage":"4162","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2028355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive Power Control Design in Doubly Fed Induction Generators for Wind Turbines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Reactive Power Control Design in Doubly Fed Induction Generators for Wind Turbines","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5191071/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869428","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive Power Control Design in Doubly Fed Induction Generators for Wind Turbines","sourcePdf":"tie-rabelo-2028355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068171S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"5191071","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5191075,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Perron","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5280586/5191075/5191075-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandre Perron (S'05) was born in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada, in 1980.

The solution to this problem unfolds into two basic subproblems. In the first step, a path-following controller is derived to force each underactuated ship to follow a reference path subject to constant disturbances induced by wave, wind, and ocean current. The controller is designed such that the ship moves on the path while its total velocity is maintained tangential to the path. In the second step, the speeds of the vehicles are adjusted so as to synchronize the positions of the corresponding virtual targets (or so-called coordination states), in the sense that the derivative of each path is left as a free input to synchronize the ships' motion. The proposed coordination controller uses a combination of Lyapunov direct method, backstepping, and concepts from graph theory. When dealing with the path-following coordination problem, it is considered that each ship transmits its coordination state to other ships with a varying time delay as determined by the communication topology. The coordination errors' convergence is achieved based on a proposed Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2028362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","startPage":"3951","endPage":"3963","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/05191077.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Path-Following Control for a Group of Underactuated Surface Vessels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5191077/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Path-Following Control for a Group of Underactuated Surface Vessels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869409","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Path-Following Control for a Group of Underactuated Surface Vessels","sourcePdf":"tie-ghommam-2028362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115007S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"5191077","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5191079,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

First, the background, regulations, standard, and applications of 60-GHz wireless communications are briefly introduced. Then, highly integrated 60-GHz radios are overviewed as a basis for the link budget analysis to derive the antenna gain requirement. Next, in order to have deep physical insight into the AoC solution, the silicon substrate's high permittivity and low resistivity effects on the AoC efficiency are examined. It is shown that the AoC solution has low efficiency, less than 12% due to large ohmic losses and surface waves, which requires the development of techniques to improve the AoC efficiency. After that, the AiP solution and associated challenges such as how to realize low-loss interconnection between the chip and antenna are addressed. It is shown that wire-bonding interconnects, although inferior to the flip-chip, are still feasible in the 60-GHz band if proper compensation schemes are utilized. An example of the AiP solution in a low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) process is presented in the 60-GHz band showing an efficiency better than 90%. A major concern with both AoC and AiP solutions is electromagnetic interference (EMI), which is also discussed. Finally, the systems level pros and cons of both AoC and AiP solutions are highlighted from the electrical and economic perspectives for system designers.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2029295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2029295","startPage":"2830","endPage":"2841","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280586/05191079.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna-on-Chip and Antenna-in-Package Solutions to Highly Integrated Millimeter-Wave Devices for Wireless Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Antenna-on-Chip and Antenna-in-Package Solutions to Highly Integrated Millimeter-Wave Devices for Wireless Communications","volume":"57","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10917859","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5191079/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna-on-Chip and Antenna-in-Package Solutions to Highly Integrated Millimeter-Wave Devices for Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"57tap10-yzhang-part1-2029295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148956S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"346","xplore-issue":"5280586","articleId":"5191079","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5191080,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00das Lopez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Public University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5238769/5191080/5191080-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez (M'05) was born in Pamplona, Spain, in 1975.

These machines are very sensitive to grid disturbances. To prevent the damages that voltage dips can cause on the converter, most machines are equipped nowadays with a crowbar that short circuits the rotor. However, during the crowbar activation, the rotor converter must be disconnected, hence the power generated with the turbine is no longer controlled. In doing so, the crowbar impedes the wind turbine from carrying out the voltage stabilization required by most new grid codes. This paper proposes a novel control strategy that notably reduces the crowbar activation time. As a result, the control of the turbine might shortly be resumed and the turbine can furthermore supply a reactive power fulfilling the newest grid regulations. Experimental results of a complete system are included, demonstrating the viability of the proposed control.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5238769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2028447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5238769/05191080.pdf","startPage":"4246","endPage":"4254","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2028447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ride Through of Wind Turbines With Doubly Fed Induction Generator Under Symmetrical Voltage Dips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Ride Through of Wind Turbines With Doubly Fed Induction Generator Under Symmetrical Voltage Dips","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5191080/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10869411","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ride Through of Wind Turbines With Doubly Fed Induction Generator Under Symmetrical Voltage Dips","sourcePdf":"tie-lopez-2028447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056304S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5238769","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"246","xplore-issue":"5238769","articleId":"5191080","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5191094,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Lu","affiliation":["Innovation Center, Eaton Corporation, Milwaukee, WI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/5191094/5191094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Lu (S'00\u2013M'06\u2013SM'09) received the B.Eng. degree in automation from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2001, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2006.","Since October 2006, he has been with the Innovation Center, Eaton Corporation, Milwaukee, WI, where he is currently an Engineering Specialist and the Program Manager.

The first one, which is the so-called multidimensional (MD) PSO, re-forms the native structure of swarm particles in such a way that they can make interdimensional passes with a dedicated dimensional PSO process. Therefore, in an MD search space, where the optimum dimension is unknown, swarm particles can seek both positional and dimensional optima. This eventually removes the necessity of setting a fixed dimension \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n priori, which is a common drawback for the family of swarm optimizers. Nevertheless, MD PSO is still susceptible to premature convergences due to lack of divergence. Among many PSO variants in the literature, none yields a robust solution, particularly over multimodal complex problems at high dimensions. To address this problem, we propose the fractional global best formation (FGBF) technique, which basically collects all the best dimensional components and fractionally creates an artificial global best (aGB) particle that has the potential to be a better \u00bfguide\u00bf than the PSO's native \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">gbest</i>\n particle. This way, the potential diversity that is present among the dimensions of swarm particles can be efficiently used within the aGB particle. We investigated both individual and mutual applications of the proposed techniques over the following two well-known domains: 1) nonlinear function minimization and 2) data clustering. An extensive set of experiments shows that in both application domains, MD PSO with FGBF exhibits an impressive speed gain and converges to the global optima at the true dimension regardless of the search space dimension, swarm size, and the complexity of the problem.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5431005/05191096.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional Particle Swarm Optimization in Multidimensional Search Space","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2015054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2015054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Particle Swarm Optimization in Multidimensional Search Space","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11171923","pubMedId":"19661007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5191096/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Particle Swarm Optimization in Multidimensional Search Space","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-kiranyaz-2015054.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14997S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5431005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"5431005","articleId":"5191096","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5191098,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge R.

The main idea is to control each robot to track its desired trajectory while synchronizing its motion with those of other robots to keep relative kinematics relationships, as required by the formation. First, we pose the formation-control problem as a synchronization control problem and identify the synchronization control goal according to the formation requirement. The formation error is measured by the position synchronization error, which is defined based on the established robot network. Second, we develop a synchronous controller for each robot's translation to guarantee that both position and synchronization errors approach zero asymptotically. The rotary controller is also designed to ensure that the robot is always oriented toward its desired position. Both translational and rotary controls are supported by a centralized high-level planer for task monitoring and robot global localization. Finally, we perform simulations and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization control approach in the formation control tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","volume":"25","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"10894922","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191100/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Synchronization Approach to Trajectory Tracking of Multiple Mobile Robots While Maintaining Time-Varying Formations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Synchronization Approach to Trajectory Tracking of Multiple Mobile Robots While Maintaining Time-Varying Formations","sourcePdf":"tro-sun-2027384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096488S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"5277110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"5277110","articleId":"5191100","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":5191101,"authors":[{"name":"Vita Pi-Ho Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5208517/5191101/5191101-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vita Pi-Ho Hu (S'09) was born in Changhua, Taiwan, in 1982.

An analytical framework to calculate the SNM for UTB SOI SRAMs operating in the subthreshold region is presented. Our results indicate that for improving both read SNM (RSNM) and write SNM (WSNM), the back-gating technique is more effective in the subthreshold region than in the superthreshold region. The 6T UTB SOI subthreshold SRAM cell with the back-gating technique by increasing the strength of the pull-up transistors and decreasing the strength of the pass-gate transistors shows comparable RSNM with the 10T bulk subthreshold SRAM and an improvement in RSNM variation. Due to better electrostatic integrity, the back-gating technique (pull-up transistors with positive back-gate bias, pull-down/pass-gate transistors with negative back-gate bias) mitigates the 6T UTB SOI SRAM RSNM variation significantly with some improvement in RSNM. Increasing cell beta-ratio shows a limited improvement on RSNM and has no benefit on the SNM variability for the subthreshold operation. The UTB SOI 8T SRAM cell exhibits RSNM 2times larger than the 6T SRAM cell in the subthreshold region. Both negative bit-line voltage (VBL) and boosted word-line voltage (VWL) are more effective than lower cell supply voltage to improve WSNM, and negative VBL shows a larger improvement in WSNM than boosted VWL.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static Noise Margin of Ultrathin-Body SOI Subthreshold SRAM Cells\u2014An Assessment Based on Analytical Solutions of Poisson's Equation","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2026322","startPage":"2120","endPage":"2127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2026322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208517","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5208517/05191101.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Static Noise Margin of Ultrathin-Body SOI Subthreshold SRAM Cells\u2014An Assessment Based on Analytical Solutions of Poisson's Equation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5191101/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828883","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static Noise Margin of Ultrathin-Body SOI Subthreshold SRAM Cells\u2014An Assessment Based on Analytical Solutions of Poisson's Equation","sourcePdf":"ted-hu-2026322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094644S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5208517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5208517","articleId":"5191101","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5191108,"authors":[{"name":"Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jayakrishnan","lastName":"Unnikrishnan","id":"37572645200"},{"name":"Venugopal V.

A group of cognitive users cooperatively tries to exploit vacancies in primary (licensed) channels whose occupancies follow a Markovian evolution. We first consider the scenario where the cognitive users have perfect knowledge of the distribution of the signals they receive from the primary users. For this problem, we obtain a greedy channel selection and access policy that maximizes the instantaneous reward, while satisfying a constraint on the probability of interfering with licensed transmissions. We also derive an analytical universal upper bound on the performance of the optimal policy. Through simulation, we show that our scheme achieves good performance relative to the upper bound and improved performance relative to an existing scheme. We then consider the more practical scenario where the exact distribution of the signal from the primary is unknown. We assume a parametric model for the distribution and develop an algorithm that can learn the true distribution, still guaranteeing the constraint on the interference probability. We show that this algorithm outperforms the naive design that assumes a worst case value for the parameter. We also provide a proof for the convergence of the learning algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2028970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","startPage":"750","endPage":"760","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05191108.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithms for Dynamic Spectrum Access With Learning for Cognitive Radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Algorithms for Dynamic Spectrum Access With Learning for Cognitive Radio","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054891","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithms for Dynamic Spectrum Access With Learning for Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"58tsp01-vveeravalli-2028970.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065172S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"90","articleId":"5191108","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5191110,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Arabaci","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5282655/5191110/5191110-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Murat Arabaci (S'01) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey, in 2003, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering in 2006 from the University of Arizona, Tucson, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His current research interests include coding theory, communication theory, and information theory."]},"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Arabaci","id":"37317529300"},{"name":"Ivan B.

It is demonstrated that a well-known two-path model component is dominantly observed in a typical LoS desktop channel along with the components of the other non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths. Then, the deterministic two-path model is extended to a statistical two-path model by introducing random variables for the antenna position and merging with the conventional SV-model which is suitable to express NLoS path components. The proposed channel model parameters are extracted in a typical LoS desktop environment, and then the cumulative distribution of total path power gain is discussed using a simulation technique that assumes a specific antenna location scenario. It is shown that the cumulative distribution of total path power gain obtained using the proposed model is useful to estimate the outage probability of the mmW WPAN link.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2029286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2029286","startPage":"2940","endPage":"2948","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280586/05191115.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified SV-Model Suitable for Line-of-Sight Desktop Usage of Millimeter-Wave WPAN Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Modified SV-Model Suitable for Line-of-Sight Desktop Usage of Millimeter-Wave WPAN Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","volume":"57","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191115/","accessionNumber":"10917858","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191115/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified SV-Model Suitable for Line-of-Sight Desktop Usage of Millimeter-Wave WPAN Systems","sourcePdf":"57tap10-yshoji-part1-2029286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121543S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5280586","articleId":"5191115","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5191121,"authors":[{"name":"Peter R.

The array uses a new type of circularly polarized element, comprising a circular slot loaded with an elliptical patch, and is fed by a microstrip line. The array is implemented on liquid crystal polymer (LCP), which is both low-loss and low-cost. A total of 8 array elements are used in a 4 times 2 configuration to achieve a maximum gain target of greater than 14 dBic. Sequential rotation of the elements within each of the 2 times 2 sub-arrays is used to increase the axial ratio bandwidth. Other novel features of the array are the finite ground plane, and open cavity structure used to support the LCP substrate of the slot array above a reflector plate. Measured and computed results presented for the packaged array confirm its wide impedance, axial ratio, and gain bandwidths. The effect of the packaged array back-short on the measured axial ratio is also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280586/05191129.pdf","startPage":"2862","endPage":"2870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2029305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2029305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circularly Polarized Ellipse-Loaded Circular Slot Array for Millimeter-Wave WPAN Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polarization","Slot antennas","Millimeter wave technology","High definition video","Bandwidth","Packaging","Liquid crystal polymers","Antenna measurements","Wireless personal area networks","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["liquid crystal polymers","millimetre wave antennas","personal area networks","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ellipse-loaded circular slot array","millimeter-wave antennas","liquid crystal polymer","elliptical patch","sequential rotation","wireless personal area networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array antenna","circularly polarized slot antenna","liquid crystal polymer","millimeter wave","Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Circularly Polarized Ellipse-Loaded Circular Slot Array for Millimeter-Wave WPAN Applications","volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5191129/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917855","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circularly Polarized Ellipse-Loaded Circular Slot Array for Millimeter-Wave WPAN Applications","sourcePdf":"57tap10-aweily-part1-2029305.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068074S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5280586","articleId":"5191129","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5191132,"authors":[{"name":"Antti E.

We present a design of a uniplanar-compact electromagnetic band-gap (UC-EBG) structure on the Ferro A6-S LTCC tape system operating in the 60-GHz frequency band. The UC-EBG design is used with an aperture-coupled microstrip-line-fed patch antenna (ACMPA) and with a 16-element array to increase the antenna gain. The UC-EBG is also used to reduce the mutual coupling between antennas in the E- and H-planes. The performance of the antennas with and without UC-EBG are evaluated with the probe-station and radiation-pattern measurements. In addition, the reflection from the UC-EBG surface is measured using a WR-15 waveguide excitation. Good agreement is achieved between the simulations and the measurements. An increase of up to 4.5 and 2.3 dBi is achieved in the gain for a single element and for a 16-element array, respectively. A reduction of up to 11.8 dB is observed in the E-plane coupling between two patches. The presented design is suitable for electromagnetic shielding, reduction of coupling in integrated LTCC modules, and providing high gain antennas for low-cost millimeter-wave applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280586/05191132.pdf","startPage":"2904","endPage":"2912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2029311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2029311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UC-EBG on LTCC for 60-GHz Frequency Band Antenna Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Microstrip antenna arrays","Antenna measurements","Mutual coupling","Microstrip antennas","High-K gate dielectrics","Ceramics","Dielectric substrates","Dielectric materials","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","electromagnetic shielding","microstrip antenna arrays","microstrip lines","millimetre wave antennas","permittivity","photonic band gap","waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UC-EBG","frequency band antenna","relatively high dielectric constant","low-temperature cofired ceramic substrate materials","antenna gain","mutual coupling","antenna arrays","surface-wave power","uniplanar-compact electromagnetic band-gap structure","Ferro A6-S LTCC tape system","aperture-coupled microstrip-line-fed patch antenna","probe-station","radiation-pattern measurements","WR-I5 waveguide excitation","E-plane coupling","electromagnetic shielding","coupling reduction","low-cost millimeter-wave applications","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60 GHz","antenna array","electromagnetic band-gap (EBG)","low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC)","millimeter-wave","patch antenna","surface waves"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"UC-EBG on LTCC for 60-GHz Frequency Band Antenna Applications","volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5191132/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917857","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UC-EBG on LTCC for 60-GHz Frequency Band Antenna Applications","sourcePdf":"57tap10-alamminen-part1-2029311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107359S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5280586","articleId":"5191132","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5191133,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Song","affiliation":["Research Center of Computational Medicine, Sino-French Laboratory in Computer Science, Automation, and Applied Mathematics, Institution of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Ming Song (M'09) received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Automation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2008.","He is currently an Assistant Professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Some scientists believed that the resting state activity might reflect some neural functions that consolidate the past, stabilize brain ensembles, and prepare us for the future. Here, we modeled the default network as undirected weighted graph, and then used graph theory to investigate the topological properties of the default network of the two groups of people with different intelligence levels. We found that, in both groups, the posterior cingulate cortex showed the greatest degree in comparison to the other brain regions in the default network, and that the medial temporal lobes and cerebellar tonsils were topologically separations from the other brain regions in the default network. More importantly, we found that the strength of some functional connectivities and the global efficiency of the default network were significantly different between the superior intelligence group and the average intelligence group, which indicates that the functional integration of the default network might be related to the individual intelligent performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191133/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10929211","volume":"1","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Default Network and Intelligence Difference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Default Network and Intelligence Difference","sourcePdf":"01tamd02-tjiang-2029312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130334S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"5290358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5290358","articleId":"5191133","onlineDate":"04 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5191140,"authors":[{"name":"Ian F.

For this, the ability for spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing, choosing the best spectrum among the available options, and dynamically adapting transmission parameters based on the activity of the licensed spectrum owners must be integrated within cognitive radio users. Specifically in cognitive radio ad hoc networks, distributed multihop architecture, node mobility, and spatio-temporal variance in spectrum availability are some of the key distinguishing factors. In this article the important features of CRAHNs are presented, along with the design approaches and research challenges that must be addressed. Spectrum management in CRAHNs comprises spectrum sensing, sharing, decision, and mobility.

Basically, this classification is imposed by the activity of the users on the licensed bands that cognitive radios try to access. First, over a relatively static primary band, where primary nodes idleness largely exceeds cognitive users communication durations, static mesh routing solutions can be reused, whereas second, over dynamically available spectrum bands new specific routing solutions have to be proposed, we give some guidelines and insights about designing such solutions. Third, if cognitive radios try to access over highly active and rarely available primary bands, opportunistic forwarding without preestablished routing is to be explored.","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2009.5191142","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/5191135/05191142.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2009.5191142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","startPage":"20","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop cognitive radio networks: to route or not to route","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-August  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"04 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multihop cognitive radio networks: to route or not to route","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191142/","volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5191142/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July-August 2009","accessionNumber":"10805814","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop cognitive radio networks: to route or not to route","sourcePdf":"007KHALIFELAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044955S","chronDate":"July-August  2009","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"5191135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5191135","articleId":"5191142","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5191143,"authors":[{"name":"Alfred Asterjadhi","affiliation":["University of Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Alfred Asterjadhi (aasterja@dei.unipd.it) received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees (summa cum laude) in telecommunications engineering in 2004 and 2007, respectively, from the University of Padova, Italy.

The proposed solution is completely distributed, and does not need dedicated spectrum resources for control purposes, but rather leverages on a virtual control channel that is implemented by having users exchange control information whenever they meet in a particular channel, using network coding techniques for better dissemination performance. Due to these aspects, our proposal represents a significant improvement over existing dynamic spectrum access and multichannel MAC solutions. We discuss the effectiveness of our scheme in multihop cognitive ad hoc networks, where secondary users need to opportunistically access the spectrum at those locations and times at which it is not used by primary users.

As long term monitoring requires low power processing on the device, a low power real time seizure detection algorithm suitable for AEEG devices is proposed herein. The performance of various classifiers was tested and the most effective was found to be the Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier (LDA). The algorithm presented in this paper provides 87.7 (100-70.2)% accuracy with 94.2 (100-78)% sensitivity and 77.9 (100-52.1)% specificity in patient dependent experiments. It provides 76.5 (79.0-73.3)% accuracy with 90.9 (96.2-85.8)% sensitivity and 59.5 (70.9-52.6)% specificity in patient independent experiments. We also suggest how power can be saved at the lost of a small amount of accuracy by applying different techniques. The algorithm was simulated on a DSP processor and on an ASIC and the power estimation results for both implementations are presented. Seizure detection using the presented algorithm is approximately 100% more power efficient than other AEEG processing methods. The implementation using an ASIC can reduce power consumption by 25% relative to the implementation on a DSP processor with reduction of only 1% of accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power real-time seizure detection for ambulatory EEG","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare","doi":"10.4108/ICST.PERVASIVEHEALTH2009.6019","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare","pdfPath":"/iel5/5160793/5191145/05191226.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.4108/ICST.PERVASIVEHEALTH2009.6019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low power real-time seizure detection for ambulatory EEG","conferenceDate":"1-3 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191226/","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"11703892","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power real-time seizure detection for ambulatory EEG","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"105 paper6019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097277S","chronDate":"1-3 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5160793","isNumber":"5191145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5160793","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5191145","articleId":"5191226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5191242,"authors":[{"name":"Michael P.

The first algorithm relies on random coding techniques while the second relies only on XOR operations between pairs of packets. Complexity and feedback information tradeoffs for the two algorithms are discussed. For the case where, in addition to traffic destined exclusively to either one of the users there is additional multicast traffic, we present an algorithm that shows that the rate region of the system can be increased by allowing inter-session coding. Finally, for the case where there are random arrivals to the system we present an algorithm, based on the previous algorithms, whose stability region gets close to the capacity region for reasonably large packet sizes. The latter algorithm operates without knowledge of arrival process and channel statistics.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175244/5191384/05191394.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"61","publicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Network Coding, Theory, and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETCOD.2009.5191394","doi":"10.1109/NETCOD.2009.5191394","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Network Coding, Theory, and Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191394","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","Feedback","Multicast algorithms","Unicast","Degradation","Upper bound","Network coding","Transmitters","Statistics","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","channel coding","computational complexity","multicast communication","random codes","statistical analysis","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast erasure channel","feedback","channel capacity","ack message","random coding technique","XOR operation","algorithmic complexity","multicast traffic","inter-session coding","random arrival","stability region","channel statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191394/","displayDocTitle":"Broadcast erasure channel with feedback - Capacity and algorithms","accessionNumber":"10813712","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5191394/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcast erasure channel with feedback - Capacity and algorithms","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082441S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175244","isNumber":"5191384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175244","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5191384","articleId":"5191394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5191397,"authors":[{"name":"Danilo Silva","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Silva","id":"37320762500"},{"name":"Weifei Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Weifei","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37998228200"},{"name":"Frank R.

Instead of the usual approach of splitting packets into disjoint classes (also known as generations) we propose the use of overlapping classes. The overlapping allows the decoder to alternate between Gaussian elimination and back substitution, simultaneously boosting the performance and reducing the decoding complexity. Our approach can be seen as a combination of fountain coding and network coding. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the promise of our approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse network coding with overlapping classes","publicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Network Coding, Theory, and Applications","doi":"10.1109/NETCOD.2009.5191397","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Network Coding, Theory, and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175244/5191384/05191397.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETCOD.2009.5191397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191397/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sparse network coding with overlapping classes","conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191397/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10813714","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse network coding with overlapping classes","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077775S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175244","isNumber":"5191384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175244","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5191384","articleId":"5191397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5191398,"authors":[{"name":"Parastoo Sadeghi","affiliation":["Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering, Australian National University, Australia"],"firstName":"Parastoo","lastName":"Sadeghi","id":"37270112600"},{"name":"Danail Traskov","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, Technical University Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Danail","lastName":"Traskov","id":"37320705900"},{"name":"Ralf Koetter","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, Technical University Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Koetter","id":"37274507400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4723-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4724-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2374-9660"}],"articleNumber":"5191398","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":402},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Network coding","Broadcasting","Decoding","Throughput","Transport protocols","Delay effects","Linear programming","Stochastic processes","Out of order"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","broadcast channels","channel coding","decoding","integer programming","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive network coding","erasure broadcast channel","decoding delay minimization","decodable network coding","integer linear program","channel erasure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network coding","integer programming","opportunistic coding","broadcast channels","Gilbert-Elliott channel"]}],"abstract":"We consider the throughput-delay tradeoff in network coded transmission over erasure broadcast channels.

It is challenging to find the optimal allocation that maximizes the probability of successful recovery by the data collector because of the large space of possible symmetric and nonsymmetric allocations, and the nonconvexity of the problem. For the special case of probability-1 recovery, we show that the optimal allocation that minimizes the required budget is symmetric. We further explore several storage allocation and access models, and determine the optimal symmetric allocation in the high-probability regime for a case of interest. Based on our experimental investigation, we make a general conjecture about a phase transition on the optimal allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Network Coding, Theory, and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175244/5191384/05191399.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Network Coding, Theory, and Applications","doi":"10.1109/NETCOD.2009.5191399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NETCOD.2009.5191399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed storage allocation problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Aggregates","Redundancy","Constraint theory","Erbium","National security","Decoding","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","storage allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed storage allocation","data object","aggregate storage budget","data collector","optimal symmetric allocation","probability-1 recovery"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191399/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed storage allocation problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191399/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10813716","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"15-16 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed storage allocation problems","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"0015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076489S","chronDate":"15-16 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175244","isNumber":"5191384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175244","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5191384","articleId":"5191399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5191413,"authors":[{"name":"Michael G.

Embedded DRAM is an attractive choice for embedded memory because it consumes only 30% of standby power and 10% of active power, while it occupies only 30% of the area, compared to SRAM at the 90-nm CMOS node. At the same level of technology, embedded DRAM can achieve a soft-error rate of less than 1 FIT per Mb, which is ten to 1,000 times smaller than that of a comparable SRAM. However, a careful assessment of the benefits must be weighed against the increased process cost of four to six extra masks and masking operations. Emerging memories such as MRAM and PCRAM are nonvolatile with almost unlimited endurance and offer five orders of magnitude faster write speed than flash memory does, yet with read speed close to that of embedded DRAM. In addition, they are potentially simpler to fabricate. The MRAM cell is based on a multilayer magnetic tunnel junction with a parallel or antiparallel state to provide a 0 or1 logic state. The PCRAM cell is based on a reversible phase change between crystalline and amorphous states to provide a 0 or 1 state. These mechanisms have been proven in magnetic heads in hard disk drives and in readable/writable DVDs in discrete form. They are suitable for use as level-two or level-three cache or main memory or as storage devices for code or data. These emerging memories are about ready to be integrated into mainstream CMOS semiconductor processes.","doi":"10.1109/MSSC.2009.933521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563670/5191422/05191434.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSSC.2009.933521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Searching for the dream embedded memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Searching for the dream embedded memory","volume":"1","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10824914","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Summer 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191434/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191434/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Searching for the dream embedded memory","sourcePdf":"12-01mssc03-natarajan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102188S","chronDate":"Summer  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563670","isNumber":"5191422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563670","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5191422","articleId":"5191434","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5191463,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Li","affiliation":["University of Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Li","id":"38009789200"},{"name":"Anton Kummert","affiliation":["University of Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Kummert","id":"37269365300"},{"name":"Sam Schauland","affiliation":["University of Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Schauland","id":"37541101200"},{"name":"Joerg Velten","affiliation":["University of Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Velten","id":"37284708200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2797-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2798-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5191463","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital filters","Field programmable gate arrays","SDRAM","Hardware","Circuits","Delay","Digital signal processing","Multidimensional signal processing","Page description languages","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","field programmable gate arrays","wave digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtex2 FPGA board","external SDRAM","n-D signal processing application","3D spatio-temporal wave digital filter","hardware architecture","LCD monitor","field programmable gate arrays","synchronous dynamic random access memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wave Digital Filter","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Many n-D signal processing applications require realization in real time.

In this paper, a novel robust adaptive beamforming algorithm under directional uncertainty is therefore proposed using a Bayesian approach to respond to the current environment by learning or estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) of the actual signal from observations. The proposed algorithm can provide excellent robustness to the uncertainty of DOA of actual signal and make the mean output array SINR consistently close to the optimal one.

One neural network based such on-line identification method was studied by the author with a generalized adaptive linear element (ADALINE). Since the ADALINE is slow in convergence, which is not suitable for identification of LTV system, one technique was proposed to speed up training, that is, to introduce a momentum term to the weight adjustment during convergence period. Experimental study was then performed to search for an optimal combination of the momentum term and the learning rate eta. The goal was to speed up convergence (or tracking) while keeping smooth tracking during any transient period. Simulation results show that several optimal combinations of the momentum factor and learning rate were found and the time varying parameters of LTV systems could be identified quite effectively; which, in turn, sows that the fined tuned GADLINE is quite suitable for online system identification and real time adaptive control applications due to its low computational demand.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5191868","startPage":"775","endPage":"780","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05191868.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5191868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On training optimization of the generalized ADLINE neural network for time varying system identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Time varying systems","System identification","Convergence","Hopfield neural networks","Neurofeedback","Fault location","Delay lines","Multi-layer neural network","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","convergence","identification","learning (artificial intelligence)","linear systems","neural nets","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized ADLINE neural network training optimization","linear time-varying system identification","online system identification method","LTV system identification","generalized adaptive linear element","momentum term","weight adjustment","convergence period","time-varying parameter","GADLINE learning algorithm","real-time adaptive control application","optimal range"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["System identification","neural network","ADALINE","tapped delay line feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5191868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On training optimization of the generalized ADLINE neural network for time varying system identification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5191868/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10825756","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On training optimization of the generalized ADLINE neural network for time varying system identification","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"rp0161-WeB03-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060804S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5191868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5191869,"authors":[{"name":"Weiping Bi","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Information Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, China"],"lastName":"Weiping Bi","id":"37087745313"},{"name":"Yonghua Zhao","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Information Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, China"],"lastName":"Yonghua Zhao","id":"37087153889"},{"name":"Xuegang Mu","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Information Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, China"],"lastName":"Xuegang Mu","id":"37087763328"},{"name":"Junfeng Zhang","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Information Science, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, China"],"lastName":"Junfeng Zhang","id":"37087600336"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5191869","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","Neural networks","Symmetric matrices","Delay effects","Bismuth","Educational institutions","Mathematics","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","linear matrix inequalities","neurocontrollers","recurrent neural nets","stability criteria","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-dependent stability criterion","delayed recurrent neural network","LMI approach","linear matrix inequality","time-varying delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay-dependent","Recurrent neural networks","LMI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5191869","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of the stability for a delayed recurrent neural networks.

In this algorithm, the notion of species was introduced into population diversity measure. The species technique is based on the concept of dividing the population into several species according to their similarity. The inertia weight was nonlinearly adjusted by using population diversity information at each iteration step. Velocity mutation operator and position crossover operator were both introduced and the global performance was clearly improved. The APSO algorithm was adapted to search the optimal parameters of support vector machine (SVM) to increase the accuracy of SVM. A novel short-term load forecasting model based on SVM with APSO algorithm (APSO-SVM) is presented. The proposed model was tested on a certain electricity load forecasting problem. The empirical results illustrated that the new APSO-SVM model outperformed SVM, BPNN and regression model and can successfully identify the optimal values of parameters of SVM with the lowest prediction error values in load forecasting. Therefore, this model is efficient and practical during a short-term load forecasting of electric power system.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192275","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192275.pdf","startPage":"1448","endPage":"1453","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A short-term load forecasting approach based on support vector machine with adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A short-term load forecasting approach based on support vector machine with adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10825738","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5192275/","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A short-term load forecasting approach based on support vector machine with adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm","confLoc":"Guilin","sourcePdf":"rp0294-ThA02-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083084S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5192275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5192315,"authors":[{"name":"Fengjian Yang","affiliation":["Computational Science Department, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fengjian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37405692900"},{"name":"Chaolong Zhang","affiliation":["Computational Science Department, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chaolong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533371800"},{"name":"Dongqing Wu","affiliation":["Computational Science Department, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dongqing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37402881500"},{"name":"Jianfu Yang","affiliation":["Computational Science Department, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianfu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406099500"},{"name":"Chuanxiang Gao","affiliation":["Computational Science Department, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Chuanxiang Gao","id":"37088003291"},{"name":"Lishi Liang","affiliation":["The 5th Middle School of Guangzhou City, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Lishi Liang","id":"37087428803"},{"name":"Qun Hong","affiliation":["Haizhu District Chigang Primary School of Guangzhou City, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Qun Hong","id":"37087427528"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192315","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192315","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Neural networks","Cellular neural networks","Electronic mail","Hopfield neural networks","Delay effects","Cities and towns","Output feedback","State feedback","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lyapunov methods","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive neural network","fixed point theory","Lyapunov functional","Lyapunov analysis","sufficient condition","exponential stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["impulse","neural networks","time delays","Fixed point"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192315","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192315.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","startPage":"3171","endPage":"3176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and periodicity of neural networks with delays and impulses","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the stability and periodicity for a class of impulsive neural networks with delays.

In order to effectively restrain the impact of network delay, as well as controlled plant might be time-variant or nonlinear, a novel approach is proposed that new Smith predictor combined with fuzzy radial basis function neural network (FRBFNN) for the WNCS. Because new Smith predictor hides predictor model of the network delay into real network data transmission process, further the network delay no longer need to be measured, identified or estimated on-line. Simultaneously this new Smith predictor doesn't include the prediction model of the controlled plant, thus it doesn't need to know the exact mathematical model of the controlled plant beforehand. It is applicable to some occasions that network delay is random, time-variant or uncertain, larger than one, even tens of sampling periods, and there are some data dropouts in closed loop. Based on IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee), the results of simulation show that this approach is effective.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192390","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192390.pdf","startPage":"3689","endPage":"3694","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FRBF neural network and new Smith predictor for wireless networked control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"FRBF neural network and new Smith predictor for wireless networked control systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10825500","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5192390/","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FRBF neural network and new Smith predictor for wireless networked control systems","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"rp0743-FrA08-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151595S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5192390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5192394,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Wang","id":"37401667700"},{"name":"Xianyao Meng","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"lastName":"Xianyao Meng","id":"37087353068"},{"name":"Yiming Bai","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"lastName":"Yiming Bai","id":"37087849901"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192394","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Neural networks","Neurons","Radio access networks","Approximation algorithms","Function approximation","Least squares approximation","Least squares methods","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","information retrieval","Kalman filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact fuzzy neural network","fuzzy rules online extraction","online learning process","pruning mechanism","extended Kalman filter method","nonlinear function approximation","network structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy Neural Network","Extraction of Fuzzy Rules","Online Self-constructing","Growing Criteria"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192394","abstract":"A novel paradigm termed fast and compact fuzzy neural network (FCFNN), which incorporates a pruning strategy into some growing criteria, is proposed for online extraction of fuzzy rules.

The FCFNN starts with no hidden neurons and parsimoniously generates new hidden units according to the proposed growing criteria as learning proceeds. In the second learning phase, all free parameters of the hidden units are updated by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method. The performance of the FCFNN algorithm is compared with other popular algorithms like ANFIS, GDFNN and SOFNN, etc., for nonlinear function approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the learning speed of the proposed FCFNN algorithm is faster and the network structure is more compact while comparable generalization performance and accuracy are achieved, moreover, it is capable of extracting fuzzy rules online.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192394","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192394.pdf","startPage":"4249","endPage":"4254","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast and compact fuzzy neural network for online extraction of fuzzy rules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A fast and compact fuzzy neural network for online extraction of fuzzy rules","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10825504","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5192394/","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast and compact fuzzy neural network for online extraction of fuzzy rules","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"rp0856-FrB04-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067138S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5192394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5192410,"authors":[{"name":"Hou Lin","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, Guilin, China"],"lastName":"Hou Lin","id":"37087312596"},{"name":"Li Wen-yong","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, Guilin, China"],"lastName":"Li Wen-yong","id":"37087593487"},{"name":"Ma Li","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, Guilin, China"],"lastName":"Ma Li","id":"37087210550"},{"name":"Xu Jian-min","affiliation":["College of Traffic and Communications, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xu Jian-min","id":"37087594494"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192410","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192410","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Equations","Genetic mutations","Pareto optimization","Design optimization","Genetic algorithms","Transportation","Extraterrestrial phenomena","Educational institutions","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","optimisation","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public transport network optimization","mathematical model","multiobjective optimization problems evolutionary algorithm","particle system","rank function","niche function","global Pareto optimal solution","objective function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["public transport","network optimization","MOPEA","Pareto optimal front"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Public transport network optimization based on a Multi-objective Optimization Problems Evolutionary Algorithm","startPage":"4408","endPage":"4412","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192410.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192410","abstract":"Considering the benefits of passengers and bus corporations, this paper established a mathematical model of public transport network optimization.

This algorithm can avoid premature phenomenon of public transport network optimization problems. At the same time, diversity of objective functions is reserved. This algorithm can gain compromise optimal results of conflicting multi-objective optimization problem-Pareto optimal front, and avoid changing multi-objective functions into one objective function by inducting experiential weight coefficient.

In this paper, we propose several improvements on the conventional software reliability growth models (SRGMs) to describe actual software development process by eliminating some unrealistic assumptions. Most of these models have focused on the failure detection process and not given equal priority to modeling the fault correction process. But, most latent software errors may remain uncorrected for a long time even after they are detected, which increases their impact. The remaining software faults are often one of the most unreliable reasons for software quality. Therefore, we develop a general framework of the modeling of the failure detection and fault correction processes. Furthermore, we apply neural network with back-propagation to match the histories of software failure data. We will also illustrate how to construct the neural networks from the mathematical viewpoints of software reliability modeling in detail. Finally, numerical examples are shown to illustrate the results of the integration of the detection and correction process in terms of predictive ability and some other standard criteria.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192431","startPage":"4349","endPage":"4354","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192431.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The implementation of artificial neural networks applying to software reliability modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Software reliability","Delay","Fault detection","Predictive models","Software quality","Neural networks","Programming","History","Debugging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","backpropagation","neural nets","program testing","software quality","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","software reliability modeling","general prediction model","software reliability growth model","software development process","failure detection process","fault correction process","software quality","back-propagation","software failure data","software testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network","Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP)","Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGMs)","Software Testing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"The implementation of artificial neural networks applying to software reliability modeling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5192431/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10825532","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The implementation of artificial neural networks applying to software reliability modeling","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"rp0875-FrB07-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065648S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5192431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5192457,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjun Chu","affiliation":["Institute of Operations Research and Control Sciences, Wenzhou University, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Hongjun","lastName":"Chu","id":"37896947800"},{"name":"Lixin Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Operations Research and Control Sciences, Wenzhou University, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Lixin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37274360500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192457","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Stochastic processes","Neural networks","Delay effects","Markov processes","State-space methods","Lyapunov method","Stability analysis","Stability criteria","Linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","Markov processes","neural nets","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global robust stability criterion","uncertain stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural network","mode-dependent mixed delay","Markovian jumping parameter","time-delay","discrete delay","distributed delay","continuous-time discrete-state homogenous Markov chain","finite state space","Lyapunov method","stochastic analysis approach","LMI","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cohen-Grossberg Neural Network","Markovian Jump","Time-Delay","Robust Stability","Linear Matrix Inequality"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192457","abstract":"The global robust stability problem is considered for a class of uncertain stochastic Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with Markovian jumping parameters and time-delay in this paper.

However, these variables are usually difficult to measure on-line due to the limitations such as the time delay, high cost and reliability considerations. To overcome this problem, two online soft sensors are proposed based upon a combined adaptive principal component analysis (PCA) and a dynamic multi-layered perceptron (DMLP) artificial neural network (ANN). For this purpose, a recursive PCA and a PCA based on a sliding window are presented to adaptively extract the inherent features inside the measurements with high dimensions. The extracted low-dimension features are then used recursively as the main inputs to the DMLP networks. The developed online soft sensors are finally tested on a highly nonlinear distillation column benchmark problem to illustrate their comparative performances. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the soft sensor based on the recursive PCA and the DMLP network.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192459","startPage":"3481","endPage":"3486","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192459.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of online soft sensors based on combined adaptive PCA and DMLP neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Neural networks","Chemical sensors","Artificial neural networks","Feature extraction","Monitoring","Process control","Chemical processes","Time measurement","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical engineering","chemical sensors","computerised monitoring","delays","distillation equipment","multilayer perceptrons","principal component analysis","process control","process monitoring","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online soft sensors design","combined adaptive PCA","DMLP neural networks","chemical process monitoring","chemical process controlling","time delay","reliability consideration","combined adaptive principal component analysis","dynamic multilayered perceptron artificial neural network","sliding window","feature extraction","nonlinear distillation column"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["soft sensor","Industrial distillation column","PCA","Neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of online soft sensors based on combined adaptive PCA and DMLP neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5192459/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10825581","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of online soft sensors based on combined adaptive PCA and DMLP neural networks","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"rp0702-FrA01-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065656S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5192459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5192476,"authors":[{"name":"Yuke Zhang","affiliation":["Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Yuke Zhang","id":"37088049318"},{"name":"Wei Shang","affiliation":["Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Wei Shang","id":"37087269459"},{"name":"Yu Wu","affiliation":["Hebei University, Baoding, China"],"lastName":"Yu Wu","id":"37087195828"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192476","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192476","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sustainable development","Neural networks","Economic forecasting","Artificial neural networks","Environmental economics","Principal component analysis","Design methodology","Protection","Data envelopment analysis","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","sustainable development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sustainable development","BP neural network","nonlinear relationship","artificial disturbance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sustainable Development","BP Neural Network","Index Evaluate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192476","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192476.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","startPage":"3273","endPage":"3276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192476","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on sustainable development based on neural network","abstract":"How to evaluate and forecast sustainable development is one of key subjects for research.

As Hopfield networks have no determined learning law, here, a design method based on network energy function, will be developed for parameter identification problem.

However, slow dynamics of the gain nonlinearities in conventional bulk and quantum well SOAs (mainly due to carrier heating) usually limit the performance of these amplifiers for optical signal processing at high bit rates (>10Gb/s). Using a pump-probe differential transmission technique in heterodyne detection with sub-picosecond time resolution we have measured the GS ultrafast gain recovery dynamics in electrically-pumped InGaAs/GaAs QD SOAs operating near 1.3 mum at room temperature in the presence of a pump pulse pair. Here, we have introduced a pre-pump at a variable delay time relative to the pump pulse, which can be independently adjusted in intensity and modulated separately. The results suggest a dominant effect of an inhomogeneous distribution of recovery times, as could be expected from a microstate model, rather than the effect of ES depletion. From the application point of view, our findings indicate that a pulse sequence of 2 THz repetition rate would undergo ultrafast amplification.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse amplifiers","Indium gallium arsenide","Quantum dots","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Pulse measurements","Pulse modulation","Optical pulses","Optical fiber communication","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","heterodyne detection","high-speed optical techniques","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","laser beams","optical signal detection","quantum dot lasers","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrafast pulse-pair amplification","quantum-dot amplifier","semiconductor optical amplifier","slow dynamics","gain nonlinearity","pump-probe differential transmission technique","heterodyne detection","electrically-pumped QD SOA","intensity modulation","InGaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2009.5192634","publicationTitle":"CLEO/Europe - EQEC 2009 - European Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics and the European Quantum Electronics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"CLEO/Europe - EQEC 2009 - European Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics and the European Quantum Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5164156/5191447/05192634.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2009.5192634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrafast pulse-pair amplification in InGaAs quantum-dot amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultrafast pulse-pair amplification in InGaAs quantum-dot amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192634/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5192634/","accessionNumber":"10834062","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrafast pulse-pair amplification in InGaAs quantum-dot amplifiers","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"cb4_1-tue.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041919S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164156","isNumber":"5191447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164156","xplore-issue":"5191447","articleId":"5192634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5192639,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Junsong","affiliation":["Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Wang Junsong","id":"37087878220"},{"name":"Wang Jiukun","affiliation":["Dagang Oilfield, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Wang Jiukun","id":"37087875690"},{"name":"Zeng Maohua","affiliation":["Dagang Oilfield, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Zeng Maohua","id":"37087878558"},{"name":"Wang Junjie","affiliation":["Dagang Oilfield, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Wang Junjie","id":"37087509408"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192639","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192639","abstract":"Predicting Internet traffic is needed for effective dynamic bandwidth allocation and for quality-of-service (QoS) control strategies implemented at the network edges.

Firstly, The cause of local convergence in the basic PSO algorithm is elaborated. Secondly, strategies of direct mutation for the particle velocity rather than the traditional particle position with differential evolution algorithm based on analyzing the relations of the particle velocity and the population diversity is introduced to improve the ability of effectively breaking away from the local optimum. By adding the mutation operation to the basic PSO algorithm, the proposed algorithm can maintain the characteristic of fast speed. Finally, the significant performances in quality of the optimal solutions, the global search ability and convergence speed of algorithm proposed in this paper are validated by optimizing four benchmark functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10825098","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization algorithm based on velocity differential mutation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization algorithm based on velocity differential mutation","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"rp0372-ThAIS-2-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035745S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5192756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5192779,"authors":[{"name":"Duan Qichang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Duan Qichang","id":"37087340596"},{"name":"Zhao Min","affiliation":["College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Min","id":"37087216586"},{"name":"Duan Pan","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Duan Pan","id":"37087676256"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192779","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192779","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Radial basis function networks","Clustering algorithms","Nearest neighbor searches","Convergence","Chaos","Vectors","Automation","Electronic mail","Network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","polynomials","radial basis function networks","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function neural network","improved particle swarm optimization algorithm","constriction factor approach","adaptive algorithm","polynomial function","chaotic time series"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","radial basis function neural network","nearest neighbor cluster algorithm","constriction factor"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for radial basis function neural network","startPage":"2309","endPage":"2313","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192779.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192779","abstract":"An improved particle swarm optimization (IMPSO) which synthesizes the existing models of constriction factor approach (CFA PSO) is proposed.

The new training algorithm is used to approximate polynomial function and predict chaotic time series, compared with PSO, and CFA PSO, the algorithm speed up the speed of convergence, and has much greater accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5192779/","accessionNumber":"10825111","displayDocTitle":"An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for radial basis function neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for radial basis function neural network","confLoc":"Guilin","sourcePdf":"rp0464-ThB07-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14864S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5192779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5192838,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuangkuo Li","affiliation":["School of management, Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, Guilin, China"],"lastName":"Zhuangkuo Li","id":"37087846932"},{"name":"Ning Li","affiliation":["School of management, Guilin University of Electronic and Technology, Guilin, China"],"lastName":"Ning Li","id":"37087218712"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192838","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Constraint optimization","Optimization methods","Technology management","Computational intelligence","Marketing and sales","Resource management","Heuristic algorithms","Dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","knapsack problems","matrix algebra","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Binary Particle Swarm Optimization","0/1 knapsack problem","multi mutation strategy","single mutation operator","full mutation operator","random probability","greedy transform algorithm","penalty function method","constraint handling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Binary PSO","Multi-Mutation","Greedy transform algorithm and penalty function method","0/1 Knapsack Problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192838","abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm as a novel computational intelligence technique has been applied successfully in many continuous optimization problems. Then the binary PSO (BPSO) is developed and Qi presented a modified binary PSO (QBPSO). As the two algorithms have not a satisfactory optimization capability, here in order to tackle the 0/1 knapsack problem effectively, multi mutation strategy including single mutation operator and full mutation operator binary particle swarm optimization (MMBPSO) is proposed based QBPSO algorithm. Single mutation operator can be considered as a microcosmic mutation, which adjusts the particle in local bit with a random probability. Full mutation operator is a macroscopic mutation that may change particle's all bits by a random probability. In optimization process, MMBPSO allows the generation of infeasible solutions, and uses two methods called greedy transform algorithm and penalty function method to produce the best outcomes for constraint handling, respectively. The simulation results for a series of benchmark 0/1 knapsack problems show that the proposed MMBPSO outperforms the traditional binary PSO algorithm and QBPSO, especially with the increasing quantity of the goods, as MMBPSO can effectively escape from the local optima to avoid premature convergence and obtain better solutions.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192838","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05192838.pdf","startPage":"3042","endPage":"3047","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel multi-mutation binary particle swarm optimization for 0/1 knapsack problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel multi-mutation binary particle swarm optimization for 0/1 knapsack problem","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10826100","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5192838/","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel multi-mutation binary particle swarm optimization for 0/1 knapsack problem","confLoc":"Guilin","sourcePdf":"rp0611-ThC09-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085789S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5192838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5192879,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao-di Xu","affiliation":["Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Zhao-di","lastName":"Xu","id":"37273452000"},{"name":"Zhao-di Xu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Systems Science, Shenyang Normal University, 110034, China"],"firstName":"Zhao-di","lastName":"Xu","id":"37087512981"},{"name":"Zhen-peng Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Systems Science, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zhen-peng","lastName":"Li","id":"37675303500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192879","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Wavelet analysis","Diseases","Function approximation","Surveillance","Signal analysis","Artificial neural networks","Application software","Nonlinear control systems","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","medical computing","neural nets","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet neural network","epidemic outbreak","wavelet function","activation function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet neural networks","Wavelet function","Fitting test","Classification and prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192879","abstract":"In order to predict the epidemic outbreak, this paper presented a wavelet neural network method.

In the present analysis a rod-type PCF with a 19-missing air-hole core, whose radius is 30 mum, has been considered. Initially, a PCF step-index model has been applied to identify a proper ring characteristic that is width, position and refractive index. Then rod-type PCF designs have been optimized with a full-vector modal solver based on the finite-element method. Then, the amplification properties of the Yb-doped rod-type PCFs have been investigated by assuming a forward-pumped configuration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2009.5192920","publicationTitle":"CLEO/Europe - EQEC 2009 - European Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics and the European Quantum Electronics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"CLEO/Europe - EQEC 2009 - European Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics and the European Quantum Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5164156/5191447/05192920.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2009.5192920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-mode amplification in Yb-doped rod-type photonic crystal fibers for high brilliance lasers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Single-mode amplification in Yb-doped rod-type photonic crystal fibers for high brilliance lasers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5192920/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10827370","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5192920/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-mode amplification in Yb-doped rod-type photonic crystal fibers for high brilliance lasers","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"cj_p_22-thu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037704S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164156","isNumber":"5191447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164156","xplore-issue":"5191447","articleId":"5192920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5192934,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaozheng Mou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xiaozheng Mou","id":"37087835437"},{"name":"Wuneng Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Wuneng Zhou","id":"37087332427"},{"name":"Lin Pan","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lin Pan","id":"37087516140"},{"name":"Qingyu Zhu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Qingyu Zhu","id":"37087364813"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5192934","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Delay estimation","Adaptive control","Delay effects","Stochastic processes","Robust stability","Feedback control","Educational institutions","Information science","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","discrete time systems","feedback","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearly stochastically coupled identical neural networks","synchronization control","mixed time-delays","discrete time-delays","distributed time-delays","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method","linear matrix inequality","delayed feedback controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synchronization","Stochastic coupling","Discrete and distributed time-delays","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","Global asymptotic stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5192934","abstract":"This paper is concerned with the synchronization control problem of an array of linearly stochastically coupled identical neural networks with discrete and distributed time-delays.

In this paper we present results of our efforts to overcome this hurdle by exploiting the combined computational power of multiple graphical processing units (GPUs). We have implemented forward and backward projection steps of reconstruction on an NVIDIA Tesla S870 hardware using CUDA. We have been able to accelerate forward projection by 71x and backward projection by 137x. We generate these results with no perceptible difference in image quality between the GPU and serial CPU implementations. This work illustrates the power of using commercial off-the-shelf relatively low-cost GPUs, potentially allowing IRT tomographic image reconstruction to be run in near real time, lowering the barrier to entry of IRT, and enabling deployment in the clinic.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reconstruction algorithms","Image reconstruction","Hardware","Computed tomography","Iterative algorithms","Image quality","High performance computing","Microarchitecture","Samarium","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","computerised tomography","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi GPU implementation","iterative tomographic reconstruction algorithm","IRT tomography","clinical setting","multiple graphical processing unit","NVIDIA Tesla S870 hardware","CUDA","forward projection","backward projection","image quality","serial CPU implementation","commercial off-the-shelf","computed tomography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative reconstruction","GPU","Computed tomography"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5193014","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193014","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174537/5192959/05193014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193014","startPage":"185","endPage":"188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5192959","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi GPU implementation of iterative tomographic reconstruction algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi GPU implementation of iterative tomographic reconstruction algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193014/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5193014/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10813989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi GPU implementation of iterative tomographic reconstruction algorithms","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049417S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174537","isNumber":"5192959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174537","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5192959","articleId":"5193014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5193016,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The MR physical feasibility of the proposed encoding method is verified by Bloch simulation, and the superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193036","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174537/5192959/05193036.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5192959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toeplitz random encoding MR imaging using compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5193036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193036/","displayDocTitle":"Toeplitz random encoding MR imaging using compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5193036/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toeplitz random encoding MR imaging using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121621S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174537","isNumber":"5192959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174537","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5192959","articleId":"5193036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5193037,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Trzasko","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Imaging Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Trzasko","id":"37573018000"},{"name":"Clifton Haider","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Imaging Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Clifton","lastName":"Haider","id":"37589816300"},{"name":"Armando Manduca","affiliation":["Center of Advanced Imaging Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Armando","lastName":"Manduca","id":"37327258000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3931-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3932-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"}],"articleNumber":"5193037","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"abstract":"In this work, a nonconvex Compressive Sensing model targeted at true 3D reconstructions of highly undersampled MR angiograms acquired with parallel imaging is proposed.

emerging technique for the detection of bladder cancer. A marker substance is brought into the patient's bladder which accumulates at cancer tissue. If a suitable narrow band light source is used for illumination, a red fluorescence of the marker substance is observable. Because of the low fluorescence photon count and because of the narrow band light source, only a small amount of light is detected by the camera's CCD sensor. This, in turn, leads to strong noise in the recorded video sequence. To overcome this problem, we apply a temporal recursive filter to the video sequence. The derivation of a filter function is presented, which leads to an optimal filter in the minimum mean square error sense. The algorithm is implemented as plug-in for the real-time capable clinical demonstrator platform RealTimeFrame and it is capable to process color videos with a resolution of 768times576 pixels at 50 frames per second.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5193047/","accessionNumber":"10814022","displayDocTitle":"Denoising fluorescence endoscopy - A motion compensated temporal recursive video filter with an optimal minimum mean square error parameterization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising fluorescence endoscopy - A motion compensated temporal recursive video filter with an optimal minimum mean square error parameterization","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041777S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174537","isNumber":"5192959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174537","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5192959","articleId":"5193047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5193144,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Jung","affiliation":["Bio-Imaging & Signal Processing Laboratory,  Department of Bio and Brain engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hong Jung","id":"37292316800"},{"name":"Jong Chul Ye","affiliation":["Bio-Imaging & Signal Processing Laboratory,  Department of Bio and Brain engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Chul Ye","id":"37286744300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3931-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3932-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"}],"articleNumber":"5193144","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Magnetic resonance imaging","Compressed sensing","Spatial resolution","Signal resolution","Image reconstruction","Blood","Focusing","Electroencephalography","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","brain","cognition","image resolution","medical image processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerated functional MRI acquisition","compressed sensing","brain","MR scanning","cognitive study","blood oxygen level-dependent signal","spatio-temporal resolution fMRI technique","receiver operating characteristic curve"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fMRI","compressed sensing","FOCUSS","Karhunen-Loeve transform","ROC curve"]}],"abstract":"Functional MRI (fMRI) has been widely accepted as a standard tool to study the function of brain. However, because of the limited temporal resolution of MR scanning, researchers have experienced difficulties in various event related cognitive studies which usually require higher temporal resolution than the current acquisition protocol. Even if several accelerated fMRI methods have been proposed to overcome the limited temporal resolution, the results have not been widely accepted since there were concerns whether the result came from blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal or artifacts due to down sampling. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new high spatio-temporal resolution fMRI technique based on compressed sensing theory and to justify the performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193144","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174537/5192959/05193144.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5192959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of accelerated functional MRI acquisition using compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5193144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193144/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of accelerated functional MRI acquisition using compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814119","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5193144/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of accelerated functional MRI acquisition using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0000702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037618S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174537","isNumber":"5192959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174537","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5192959","articleId":"5193144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5193226,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid Masood","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, UK"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Masood","id":"37296815000"},{"name":"Nasir Rajpoot","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, UK"],"firstName":"Nasir","lastName":"Rajpoot","id":"37296816500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3931-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3932-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7928"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-8452"}],"articleNumber":"5193226","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"abstract":"Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) is aimed at supporting the pathologists in their diagnosis.

insertion is the method of choice for a wide variety of medical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. When flexible needles are inserted in soft tissue, these needles generally follow a curved path. Segmenting the trajectory of the needles in ultrasound images will facilitate guiding them within the tissue. In this paper, a novel algorithm for curved needle segmentation in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound images is presented. The algorithm is based on the projection of a filtered 3D image onto a two-dimensional (2D) image. Detection of the needle in the resulting 2D image determines a surface on which the needle is located. The needle is then segmented on the surface. The proposed technique is able to detect needles without any previous assumption about the needle shape, or any a priori knowledge about the needle insertion axis line.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193240/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5193240/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814215","pubMedId":"20563242","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new scheme for curved needle segmentation in three-dimensional ultrasound images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new scheme for curved needle segmentation in three-dimensional ultrasound images","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058398S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174537","isNumber":"5192959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174537","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5192959","articleId":"5193240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5193250,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Macenko","affiliation":["Departments of Computer Science, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Macenko","id":"37992645100"},{"name":"Marc Niethammer","affiliation":["Biomedical Research Imaging Center, North Carolina State University, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Niethammer","id":"37282608900"},{"name":"J.

This offers a major advance over the limitations of single-unit recording with arrays of microelectrodes, or with functional MRI. However, the analysis of optical activity to understand neuronal interactions and circuitry underlying physiological functions requires new computational approaches. Recently it has been possible to record optically from the distributed population of neurons in the brain stem generating the respiratory rhythm, breath by breath, using the compact brain stem and spinal cord preparation of the fetal mouse stained in vitro with calcium-sensitive dye. The simultaneous electrical activity of phrenic motoneurons that innervate the diaphragm measures the timing of inspiratory breaths. In the present work, fluorescence micrographs taken at 4-100 Hz over 20-40 sec have been analyzed with the simultaneously recorded electrical signal from the phrenic nerve, in a Conditional Random Field framework. This computational analysis will be a useful tool for understanding the cellular circuitry in the living brain controlling fundamental physiological processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193289/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10814262","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5193289/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of nerve activity and optical signals from mouse brain stem to identify cells generating respiratory rhythms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of nerve activity and optical signals from mouse brain stem to identify cells generating respiratory rhythms","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05491S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174537","isNumber":"5192959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174537","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5192959","articleId":"5193289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5193321,"authors":[{"name":"Marcio M.

These two problems cannot be solved independently as a post-processing task, hence the most important contribution in this work is to a-priori denoise and reduce photobleaching simultaneously by using the compressed sensing framework (CS). In this paper, we propose a CS-based denoising framework, based on statistical properties of the CS optimality, noise reconstruction characteristics and signal modeling applied to microscopy images with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our approach has several advantages over traditional denoising methods, since it can under-sample, recover and denoise images simultaneously. We demonstrate with simulated and practical experiments on fluorescence image data that thanks to CS denoising we can obtain images with similar or increased SNR while still being able to reduce exposition times.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174537/5192959/05193321.pdf","startPage":"1374","endPage":"1377","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging: From Nano to Macro","doi":"10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5192959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5193321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compressed sensing approach for biological microscopic image processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Microscopy","Image processing","Photobleaching","Noise reduction","Signal to noise ratio","Fluorescence","Noise level","Degradation","Image quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","fluorescence","image coding","image denoising","image reconstruction","medical image processing","optical microscopy","optical saturable absorption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing approach","biological microscopic image processing","fluorescence microscopy","photobleaching","cross-dependent problem","image quality","CS-based denoising framework","image reconstruction","image denoising method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","denoising","multi-scale","biological microscopy","photobleaching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","displayDocTitle":"A compressed sensing approach for biological microscopic image processing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5193321/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10813934","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compressed sensing approach for biological microscopic image processing","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"0001374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051956S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 1 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174537","isNumber":"5192959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174537","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5192959","articleId":"5193321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5193372,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Therefore using meta-heuristic algorithms is a suitable approach in order to cope with its difficulty. In meta-heuristic algorithms, generating individuals in the initial step has an important effect on the convergence behavior of the algorithm and final solutions. Using some heuristics for generating one or more near-optimal individuals in the initial step can improve the final solutions obtained by meta-heuristic algorithms. Different criteria can be used for evaluating the efficiency of scheduling algorithms, the most important of which are makespan and flowtime.In this paper we propose an efficient heuristic method and then we will compare with five popular heuristics for minimizing makespan and flowtime in heterogeneous distributed computing systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization","pdfPath":"/iel5/5193618/5193619/05193632.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization","doi":"10.1109/CSO.2009.487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSO.2009.487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5193619","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5193632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Heuristics for Scheduling Independent Tasks on Heterogeneous Distributed Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed computing","Optimal scheduling","Processor scheduling","High performance computing","NP-complete problem","Scheduling algorithm","Genetic algorithms","Simulated annealing","Ant colony optimization","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","convergence","distributed algorithms","minimax techniques","minimisation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["independent task scheduling","NP-complete problem","meta-heuristic algorithm","convergence behavior","flowtime minimization","makespan minimization","heterogeneous distributed computing system","min-max heuristic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["grid scheduling","artificial intelligence","nature inspired heuristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2009","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Heuristics for Scheduling Independent Tasks on Heterogeneous Distributed Environments","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5193632/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10817647","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Heuristics for Scheduling Independent Tasks on Heterogeneous Distributed Environments","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3605a008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056584S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5193618","isNumber":"5193619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5193618","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5193619","articleId":"5193632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5193643,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Ding","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Ding","id":"37290044400"},{"name":"Siwei Luo","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siwei","lastName":"Luo","id":"37290146900"},{"name":"Zhan Gao","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37291178900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3605-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5193643","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Grid computing","Partitioning algorithms","Runtime","Scheduling algorithm","Costs","Computational modeling","Information technology","NP-complete problem","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual heuristic scheduling strategy","grid environments","independent tasks collection","task searching","tasks reassignment","task partition-based heuristic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["grid","task scheduling","task partition","dual heuristic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5193643","abstract":"Focusing on the fact that the collection of independent tasks to be scheduled onto the grid is always on a large-scale, a conception of task partition is proposed to group tasks exclusively according to the machine that gives the earliest completion time.

Few algorithms can separate multiple signals and find their directions when there is no a priori knowledge about signals and their directions. We propose an improved algorithm to resolve this problem, allowing the element weights to be adapted to the element delays, which could possibly increase performance and speed up convergence. It is using the narrowband assumption and adjusting complex weights other than delays. Real radiated noises of ships and computer simulation data are used to test the improved algorithm. The results of the experiments reveal the signal separation performance and convergence rate are superior to independent component analysis blind beamformer. The sampling rate could also be less because phase shifts are used instead of time shifts.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSO.2009.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5193619","startPage":"821","endPage":"824","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Joint Conference on Computational Sciences and Optimization","pdfPath":"/iel5/5193618/5193619/05193817.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Adaptive Beamformer Based on Independent Component Analysis for Underwater Passive Acoustic Source Separation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5193817/","displayDocTitle":"Blind Adaptive Beamformer Based on Independent Component Analysis for Underwater Passive Acoustic Source Separation","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10817737","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Adaptive Beamformer Based on Independent Component Analysis for Underwater Passive Acoustic Source Separation","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3605a821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078343S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5193618","isNumber":"5193619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5193618","xplore-issue":"5193619","articleId":"5193817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5193832,"authors":[{"name":"Qi-Wen Ran","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Qi-Wen","lastName":"Ran","id":"37283250700"},{"name":"Hui Zhao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37402333200"},{"name":"Gui-Xia Ge","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Gui-Xia","lastName":"Ge","id":"37628339300"},{"name":"Jing Ma","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Ma","id":"37407129600"},{"name":"Li-Ying Tan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Tunable Laser Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Li-Ying","lastName":"Tan","id":"37404436700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3605-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5193832","dbTime":"80 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Fourier transforms","Signal sampling","Signal analysis","Fourier series","Chirp","Wavelet domain","Optimization methods","Radio access networks","Tunable circuits and devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandlimited signals","Fourier series","Fourier transforms","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling analysis","weighted fractional Fourier transform domain","classical Shannon sampling theorem","Fourier series expansion","band-limited signal reconstruction procedure","orthogonal sampling basis"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new method for analysis of the sampling and reconstruction conditions of signals by use of the weighted fractional Fourier transform (WFRFT).

Experiment results show that the statistical ANN approach performs well on stock index return series compared to traditional forecasting methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5193889/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10826542","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5193889/","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Neural Network Approach for Value-at-Risk Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Neural Network Approach for Value-at-Risk Analysis","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3605c017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045539S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5193618","isNumber":"5193874","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5193618","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5193874","articleId":"5193889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5193893,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Wu","affiliation":["South China Sea Meteorology and Disaster, Mitigation Research Key Laboratory, Hainan Institute of Meteorological Sciences, Haikou, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Wu","id":"38007842800"},{"name":"Xi Lin","affiliation":["South China Sea Meteorology and Disaster, Mitigation Research Key Laboratory, Hainan Institute of Meteorological Sciences, Haikou, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Lin","id":"38002945600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3605-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5193893","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Floods","Computer networks","Weather forecasting","Meteorology","Predictive models","Fuzzy logic","Ocean temperature","Sea level","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric precipitation","climatology","floods","fuzzy logic","fuzzy neural nets","geophysics computing","principal component analysis","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural network","flood","precipitation forecasting","Hainan province","China","principal component analysis","traditional stepwise regression model","climate forecasting","fuzzy logic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5193893","abstract":"Taking the flood season (from May to October) precipitation in Hainan province as the forecast object, the application of fuzzy neural networks forecasting method with different forecast factors is studied.

Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed complex wavelet packet based MC-CDMA (CWP-MC-CDMA) system outperforms conventional MC-CDMA system and it is slightly superior to the conventional MC-CDMA with cyclic prefix (CP). Without any CP, the system has much higher spectrum efficiency.

Then global-convergence of the weights-iterative-formula is proved. As the results, a weights-direct-determination method is achieved, which could obtain the optimal weights of such a neural network in one step by using pseudo-inverse.

The QRD-M algorithm reduces the complexity by selecting M candidates with the smallest accumulated metrics at each level of the tree search. The trade-off between performance and complexity can be adjusted only by setting the parameter M which cannot provide more valuable tradeoff options with better performance to complexity ratio. Based on the equivalent QRD-M model, a new detection scheme is proposed in this paper for MIMO system on flat fading channel. The detection scheme, named as improved QRD-M (IQRD-M) with two independent parameters, is composed of two parts. After performing QR decomposition of the channel matrix, the MLD with length P is done, the accumulated metrics are calculated and sorted, which gives an ordered set, then IQRD-M algorithm is used to search the left layers with novel termination methods. The proposed algorithm provides better tradeoff options and more near-ML performance with low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CASE.2009.121","publicationTitle":"2009 IITA International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems Engineering (case 2009)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IITA International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems Engineering (case 2009)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5194366/5194367/05194500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE.2009.121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5194367","startPage":"496","endPage":"499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved QRD-M Detection Algorithm for MIMO Communication System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5194500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Improved QRD-M Detection Algorithm for MIMO Communication System","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5194500/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10806952","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5194500/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved QRD-M Detection Algorithm for MIMO Communication System","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"3728a496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047395S","chronDate":"11-12 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5194366","isNumber":"5194367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5194366","xplore-issue":"5194367","articleId":"5194500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5194530,"authors":[{"name":"Pham The Bao","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Science, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Pham The","lastName":"Bao","id":"37673139000"},{"name":"Huynh Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Science, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Huynh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38006097100"},{"name":"Duy Nhan","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Science, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Duy","lastName":"Nhan","id":"37992187500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3728-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5194530","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5194530","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mouth","Neural networks","Face detection","Runtime","Color","Image segmentation","Skin","Robustness","Feature extraction","Automatic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image colour analysis","image segmentation","neural nets","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mouth detection","neural network","color image","image segmentation","lip color","image classification"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CASE.2009.37","pdfPath":"/iel5/5194366/5194367/05194530.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IITA International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems Engineering (case 2009)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IITA International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems Engineering (case 2009)","startPage":"616","endPage":"619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5194367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE.2009.37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach to Mouth Detection Using Neural Network","abstract":"This paper proposes a new method to detect mouth in color image.

Since the MU-MIMO can improve the sum capacity significantly by transmitting the data streams to multiple users simultaneously without much link gain while the fixed relay station can improve the link gain but loses the spectral efficiency due to the half-duplex transmission, our proposed scheme can compensate each of the drawbacks and can improve both the sum rate and the link gain. We adopt the practical random unitary beamforming (RUB) precoding method for MU-MIMO and the simple amplify-and-forward protocol for the operation of the relay station. Based on our proposed RUB based MU-MIMO with fixed RS, the sum capacity is upper bounded by the channels between the BS and the RS, not by the channels between the RS and the users.

However, FH-OFDM system is sensitive to frequency offset and timing offset, which are inherently unavoidable in wireless mobile communication systems and can seriously degraded system performance. So, research on estimation and compensation of these offsets is of great importance. In this paper, a novel joint method for estimating carrier frequency offset and timing offset is proposed. This algorithm exploits pilots to estimate the offsets, and compared with other methods, the processing can be completed in one symbol time period. Thus, this method can be used in both static and ergodic channel. The estimation can be divided into frequency offset estimation and timing offset estimation. Also, both frequency offset and timing offset estimation are divided into two steps: coarse frequency offset estimation step, fine frequency offset estimation step, fraction timing offset estimation step and integer timing offset estimation step. Through the computer simulations, the suggested algorithm shows very good performance results both in AWGN and multipath environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference

Tolerant Networking Flight Validation Experiment on NASA's EPOXI Mission","abstract":"In October and November of 2008, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory installed and tested essential elements of Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) technology on the Deep Impact spacecraft. This experiment, called Deep Impact Network Experiment (DINET), was performed in close cooperation with the EPOXI project which has responsibility for the spacecraft. During DINET some 300 images were transmitted from the JPL nodes to the spacecraft. Then they were automatically forwarded from the spacecraft back to the JPL nodes, exercising DTN's bundle origination, transmission, acquisition, dynamic route computation, congestion control, prioritization, custody transfer, and automatic retransmission procedures, both on the spacecraft and on the ground, over a period of 27 days. All transmitted bundles were successfully received, without corruption. The DINET experiment demonstrated DTN readiness for operational use in space missions. This activity was part of a larger NASA space DTN development program to mature DTN to flight readiness for a wide variety of mission types by the end of 2011.

With the bionic evolution based parameter optimizing algorithm, we put forward an intrusion analyzing scheme for IDS; the scheme is composed of anomaly-based detection and misuse-based detection.

The system is composed of a mode-locked fiber laser producing 4.7 ps at 20 MHz. The pulses then are successively amplified in a polarization-maintained core-pumped fiber amplifier followed by a cladding pumped power amplifier based on a counter-pumped air-clad fiber amplifier. The fiber amplifier was pumped by a high-brightness fiber pigtailed laser diode operating at 915 nm. Self-phase modulation-induced spectral broadening has been achieved after transmission of amplified pulses through an optimized length of passive air-clad fiber spliced to the Yb-doped air-clad fiber. The air-clad enables pump delivery to the active fiber so that the pump power was free-space launched into the passive fiber end. The passive fiber was designed to match the dimensions of the Yb-doped fiber to minimize signal and pump loss.","doi":"10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2009.5194618","publicationTitle":"CLEO/Europe - EQEC 2009 - European Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics and the European Quantum Electronics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"CLEO/Europe - EQEC 2009 - European Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics and the European Quantum Electronics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5164156/5191447/05194618.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLEOE-EQEC.2009.5194618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A watt-level fiber-based femtosecond source at 980 nm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5194618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-19 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5194618/","displayDocTitle":"A watt-level fiber-based femtosecond source at 980 nm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10834147","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5194618/","conferenceDate":"14-19 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A watt-level fiber-based femtosecond source at 980 nm","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"cj5_2-thu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052718S","chronDate":"14-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5164156","isNumber":"5191447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5164156","xplore-issue":"5191447","articleId":"5194618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5194640,"authors":[{"name":"Huang Weili","affiliation":["Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Huang Weili","id":"37087727246"},{"name":"Du Wei","affiliation":["Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"lastName":"Du Wei","id":"37087396952"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5194640","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5194640","abstract":"The power system load equipment is more sensitive to power quality disturbances than equipment applied in the past. Therefore, the electric supply quality has become a major concern of electric utilities and end-users. A novel approach to detect and locate power quality disturbance in distributed power system combining wavelet transform with neural network is proposed. By performing decomposition of transient waveform, the original signal is divided into two parts: the low-frequency and the high-frequency, corresponding to approximation part and details part respectively. The paper aims at complex wavelet analysis, and then explores feature extraction of disturbance signal to obtain dynamic parameters, superior to real wavelet analysis result. The characteristic vector obtained from wavelet decomposition coefficients are input data of neural network for power quality disturbance pattern recognition. The improved training algorithm is used to complete the network parameter identification. By means of simulation and experimental data, the disturbance pattern can be obtained from the neural network output. The simulation results show that the proposed method is effective for transient signal analysis, taking advantage of complex wavelet transform and neural network.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5194640","startPage":"3162","endPage":"3165","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05194640.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5194640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet neural network applied to power disturbance signal in distributed power system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Power systems","Power quality","Power system transients","Wavelet analysis","Signal analysis","Wavelet transforms","Power industry","Power system analysis computing","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electricity supply industry","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","power distribution faults","power engineering computing","power supply quality","power system parameter estimation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet neural network","power disturbance signal","distributed power system","electric supply quality","electric utility","feature extraction","pattern recognition","network parameter identification","training algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power quality disturbance","detect and locate","signal decomposition","neural network","training algorithm","characteristic vector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5194640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet neural network applied to power disturbance signal in distributed power system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5194640/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10825058","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet neural network applied to power disturbance signal in distributed power system","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"rp0635-ThCIS-1-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051594S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5194640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5194641,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfu Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computation Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Jianfu Yang","id":"37087339996"},{"name":"Fengjian Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computation Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Fengjian Yang","id":"37087340462"},{"name":"Chaolong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computation Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Chaolong Zhang","id":"37087340138"},{"name":"Dongqing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computation Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Dongqing Wu","id":"37087540883"},{"name":"Chuanxiang Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computation Science, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering Guangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Chuanxiang Gao","id":"37088003291"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5194641","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5194641","abstract":"The main purpose of this paper is to study the globally exponential stability of the equilibrium point for a class of impulsive neural networks with time-varying delays.

The risk of turbine-generator set failure can be remarkably reduced if normal service condition can be arranged in advance. An effective approach based on wavelet neural network is presented for vibration signal analysis and fault diagnosis. The wavelet transform exhibits not only more comprehensive results, but also delivers a variety of possible explanations to the investigated problem. The main advantage of wavelet transform for signal analysis is that the wavelet coefficients are obtained by correlating vibration signal with the wavelet basis functions so that all possible fault patterns can be displayed by time-scale results. The feature vector obtained from wavelet transform coefficients are presented as input vector for neural network. The improved training algorithm is used to fulfill network training process and parameter initialization. From the output values of the neural network, the fault pattern is identified in accordance with the predefined fault feature vectors, which are obtained from practical experience. At the meantime, the convergence property of wavelet network for fault diagnosis is discussed. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and accurate.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5195038","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05195038.pdf","startPage":"5234","endPage":"5237","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5195038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vibration diagnosis method based on wavelet analysis and neural network for turbine-generator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Vibration diagnosis method based on wavelet analysis and neural network for turbine-generator","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10825265","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5195038/","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vibration diagnosis method based on wavelet analysis and neural network for turbine-generator","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"rp1053-FrCIS-1-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036544S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5195038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5195043,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Zhengdao","affiliation":["College of Communication & Control Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Zhengdao","id":"37087828308"},{"name":"Zhang Weihua","affiliation":["Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, CN"],"lastName":"Zhang Weihua","id":"37087743642"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5195043","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5195043","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fault detection","Fault diagnosis","Aircraft propulsion","Nonlinear filters","Time series analysis","Recurrent neural networks","Aerospace control","Aircraft manufacture","Prediction methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft control","discrete systems","fault location","military aircraft","probability","radial basis function networks","state estimation","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based fault detection","neural network based fault identification","fighter control surface failure","representative complex system","nonlinear time series","discrete dynamic system","series prediction method","online adaptive RBFNN","one-step-ahead prediction method","probability density estimation","hypothesis testing","observation error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault Detection and Identification","model-unknown system","RBF","Fighter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5195043","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05195043.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","startPage":"5256","endPage":"5261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5195043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based fault detection and identification for fighter control surface failure","abstract":"As a representative complex system, the aircraft modeled very difficultly and imprecisely. This makes the model-based fault detection methods degenerated. In this dissertation, the nonlinear time series, which is constructed by output variables of aircraft, is converted into discrete dynamic system, and then a novel series prediction method is achieved by the adaptive observation of system states. An online adaptive RBFNN is used to fit the nonlinearity of system and to compensate the unknown disturbance. Thereby a one-step-ahead prediction method is proposed. By using probability density estimation and hypothesis testing for the observation error, the fault is detected directly. Finally, a rule-table is established for fault identification.

An effective method for aeroengine fault diagnosis using wavelet neural networks is proposed. The wavelet transform can accurately detect and localize the characteristics of transient signal in time-frequency domain. The advantage of wavelet transform is in achieving flexible frequency resolution logarithmic time frequency bands, thus making it able to extract both high-frequency and low-frequency components from the vibration signal. The characteristic information obtained are input nodes of neural network for fault pattern recognition. The mathematics model for aeroengine fault diagnosis is established and the improved optimization technique for neural network training algorithm is used to accomplish the network parameter identification. By means of enough experiment samples to train the neural network, the fault mode can be obtained from the network output result. Furthermore, the robustness of wavelet network for fault diagnosis is discussed. The results obtained from the application of the method on monitored data collected from a facility validate the utility of this approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195079/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10825306","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5195079/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network modeling of aircraft power plant and fault diagnosis method using time frequency analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network modeling of aircraft power plant and fault diagnosis method using time frequency analysis","confLoc":"Guilin","sourcePdf":"rp0078-WeAIS-1-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067778S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5195079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5195112,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Bo","affiliation":["The missile Institute, Air Force Engineering University, Sanyuan, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Fan Bo","id":"37087689910"},{"name":"Xue Peng","affiliation":["The missile Institute, Air Force Engineering University, Sanyuan, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Xue Peng","id":"37087666207"},{"name":"Liu Junjie","affiliation":["The missile Institute, Air Force Engineering University, Sanyuan, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Liu Junjie","id":"37087691250"},{"name":"Dong Ming","affiliation":["The missile Institute, Air Force Engineering University, Sanyuan, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Dong Ming","id":"37087348622"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5195112","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5195112","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog circuits","Fault diagnosis","Neural networks","Fuzzy logic","Frequency domain analysis","Circuit faults","Dictionaries","Circuit simulation","Voltage","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","circuit analysis computing","fault diagnosis","frequency-domain analysis","fuzzy logic","neural nets","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog circuit fault diagnosis","neural network","fuzzy logic","RPROP network","time domain","frequency domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog circuit","RPROP","fuzzy logic","fault diagnosis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5195112","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05195112.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","startPage":"199","endPage":"202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5195112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog circuit fault diagnosis based on neural network and fuzzy logic","abstract":"RPROP network is applied to fault diagnosis of analog circuit in time domain and frequency domain.

Simulation results obtained on a drilling system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2009.5195142","startPage":"23","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2009.5195142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191464","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174536/5191464/05195142.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive neural network control of uncertain nonlinear plants with input saturation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195142/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive neural network control of uncertain nonlinear plants with input saturation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5195142/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10825987","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive neural network control of uncertain nonlinear plants with input saturation","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"rp0014-WeA01-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051805S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5195142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5195163,"authors":[{"name":"He Ping","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"He Ping","id":"37087904873"},{"name":"Li Min","affiliation":["Heilongjiang August First Land Reclamation University, Daqing, China","Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Li Min","id":"37087355221"},{"name":"Qian Yuheng","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Qian Yuheng","id":"37087961665"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5195163","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Petroleum","Neural networks","Pumps","Engines","Lighting control","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Genetic algorithms","Expert systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","expert systems","fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","genetic algorithms","inference mechanisms","mechanical engineering computing","neurocontrollers","oil technology","pumps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expert control system","oil pump energy-saving","genetic neural network","light load operation","oil fields","intermittent start-stop operation method","fuzzy neural network reasoning machine","weak inference","inference engine","genetic algorithm","rule inference","traditional expert system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Oil Pump Energy-Saving","Expert Control","Fuzzy Neural Network","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5195163","abstract":"In order to deal with the problem of light load operation of most oil pumps in oil fields, an oil pump energy-saving ldquointermittent start-stoprdquo operation method based on genetic neural network and expert control is proposed in this paper.

Recently hybrid methods that are based on combination of different approaches have shown more potential in this regard. This paper also introduces a new method by embedding the idea of particle swarm (PS) intelligence into the well-known method of simulated annealing (SA). This way SA has been capable to search a subspace of the search space by means of an individual particle; therefore the annealing process can start from lower temperatures and use shorter Markov chains for each particle, leading to faster solutions. The results obtained with the proposed method show its potential in achieving both accuracy and speed in small and medium size problems, compared to many advanced

been assumed that the random network-induced delay only exists between sensor and controller and the time delay occuring at current sampling step is taken as the sampling period between current sampling step and next sampling step. It is assumed that the random delay is subjected to a uniform distribution in the interval between 0 and the maximal random delay. The proposed stochastic optimal controller is shown to produce a closed loop system which exhibits exponentially mean square stability. In the end, the simulations on an inverted pendulum process and DC motor are studied, which show that the proposed algorithm can produce desired control effect.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195192/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5195192/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10826037","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic optimal control based on variable-period sampling model for Networked Control Systems with random delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic optimal control based on variable-period sampling model for Networked Control Systems with random delays","confLoc":"Guilin","sourcePdf":"rp1125-FrD03-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0487S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174536","isNumber":"5191464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174536","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5191464","articleId":"5195192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5195209,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Hua","affiliation":["Engineering Technology Research Centre of Hebei Province of Producing Process Automation, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Meng Hua","id":"37087824511"},{"name":"Wang Yanhong","affiliation":["Engineering Technology Research Centre of Hebei Province of Producing Process Automation, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Wang Yanhong","id":"37088119854"},{"name":"Lv Xuan","affiliation":["Engineering Technology Research Centre of Hebei Province of Producing Process Automation, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Lv Xuan","id":"37088050427"},{"name":"Xue-Li Wu","affiliation":["Engineering Technology Research Centre of Hebei Province of Producing Process Automation, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China","Yanshan University\uc2a0, Qinhuangdao, China"],"lastName":"Xue-Li Wu","id":"37087440017"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2722-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2723-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"5195209","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":24},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5195209","abstract":"A novel method is proposed in this note for exponential stability of cellular neural networks with time-varying delay.

The frame work presented in this study integrated methodology of rough set (RS) and artificial neural network (ANN) will serve as a basis for a knowledge-based system model which will guide the contracting organizations in reaching strategically correct bid/no bid and make decisions. Using rough sets, we can get reduced information table, which implies that the number of evaluation criteria such as reputation of company and risks of project is reduced with no information loss through rough set approach. And then, this reduced information is used to develop classification rules and train neural network to infer appropriate parameters.

The array is formed by arc-probe-fed annular ring elements and pairs of cross microstrip dipoles nested together. The bandwidth of the annular ring antenna is improved through arc-probe-fed technique. The measured impedance bandwidths determined by VSWR\u226a2 cover 806\u223c960 MHz and 1710\u223c2170MHz. The port isolation and the symmetry of the radiation for the lower band are improved by the \u201canti-phase and dual-feed\u201d technique which also reduces the cross polarization level. The influences on the radiation patterns of upper band caused by the phase error are invested and the radiation patterns are improved through the phase compensation. In the end, the array is designed and the simulated and measured results are presented.

Currently, in Salamanca, an environmental monitoring network (EMN) is installed in which time series of criteria pollutants and meteorological variables are obtained. Unfortunately air pollution level is computed in each monitoring station without taking into account those meteorological variables. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to compute air pollution levels taking the meteorological variables as a decision factor by means of data fusion and neural networks. First, in preprocessing stage two feature vectors (FV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SO</sub>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n and FV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PM</sub>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sub>\n) are built for each monitoring station. Next, in data fusion stage, a representative feature vector by pollutant (RFV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SO</sub>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n and RFV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PM</sub>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sub>\n) is built with the maximum value of the three FVs. Finally, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained with the RFV in order to classify future environmental situations. Self-organizing map (SOM) is the ANN applied. In this paper, time series of pollutant concentrations and meteorological variables are obtained from the EMN. EMN is composed for the three monitoring stations in Salamanca. Data used in this study have approved according to Proaire environmental authority standards.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195858/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10813638","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5195858/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Data fusion and neural network combination method for air pollution level monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data fusion and neural network combination method for air pollution level monitoring","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rps0088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081109S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175248","isNumber":"5191764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175248","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5191764","articleId":"5195858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5195865,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This foraging behaviour has been adapted in a bee colony optimization (BCO) algorithm together with 2-opt local search to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP). To reduce the high overhead incurred by 2-opt in the BCO algorithm proposed previously, two mechanisms named frequency-based pruning strategy (FBPS) and fixed-radius near neighbour (FRNN) 2-opt are presented. FBPS suggests that only a subset of promising solutions are allowed to perform 2-opt based on the accumulated frequency of its building blocks recorded in a matrix. FRNN 2-opt is an efficient implementation of 2-opt which exploits the geometric structure in a permutation of TSP sequence. Both mechanisms are tested on a set of TSP benchmark problems and the results show that they are able to achieve a 58.42% improvement while maintaining the solution quality at 0.02% from known optimal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5195901/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10813682","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An efficient Bee Colony Optimization algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem using frequency-based pruning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient Bee Colony Optimization algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem using frequency-based pruning","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rps0131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096927S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175248","isNumber":"5191764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175248","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5191764","articleId":"5195901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5195920,"authors":[{"name":"Breno Pinto","affiliation":["Computer Security Incident Response Team, Brasil Telecom, Brasilia, Brazil"],"firstName":"Breno","lastName":"Pinto","id":"38011227900"},{"name":"Varin Khera","affiliation":["Nokia Siemens Networks, Inc., Australia"],"firstName":"Varin","lastName":"Khera","id":"37688547600"},{"name":"Chun Che Fung","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Australia"],"firstName":"Chun Che","lastName":"Fung","id":"37396285700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3759-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3760-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"5195920","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"abstract":"Many detection techniques against worms, denial of service attacks and botnets on the Internet have been developed. It is difficult to detect these threats if the malicious traffic has insufficient intensity, which is usually the case. To make the problem worse, legitimate Internet services behaving like worm and complexity network environments undermines the efficiency of the detection techniques. This paper proposes an entropy-based Internet threats detection approach that determines and reports the traffic complexity parameters when changes in the traffic complexity content may indicate a malicious network event. Based on the experiment, the proposed method is efficient and produces less false positive and false negative alarms with a faster detection time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5175248/5191764/05195920.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"891","publicationTitle":"2009 7th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/INDIN.2009.5195920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2009.5195920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5191764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5195920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting security anomalies from internet traffic using the MA-RMSE algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Telecommunication traffic","Information security","Detection algorithms","Computer security","Computer worms","Computer crime","Web and internet services","Australia","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","Internet","security of data","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security anomaly detection","denial of service attack","Internet traffic","entropy-based Internet threats detection approach","malicious network event","MA-RMSE algorithm","measure of anomaly","representative measure of string entropy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detecting security anomalies from internet traffic using the MA-RMSE algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5195920/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10813701","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting security anomalies from internet traffic using the MA-RMSE algorithms","confLoc":"Cardiff, UK","sourcePdf":"rps0150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051694S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5175248","isNumber":"5191764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5175248","xplore-issue":"5191764","articleId":"5195920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5195959,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37404813100"},{"name":"Kaliappa Ravindran","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, USA"],"firstName":"Kaliappa","lastName":"Ravindran","id":"37323657200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3923-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3924-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5195959","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network servers","Genetic algorithms","Web server","Greedy algorithms","Internet","Telecommunication traffic","Costs","Computational efficiency","Mathematical model","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content management","genetic algorithms","greedy algorithms","Internet","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimization algorithm","proxy server placement","content distribution network","Web site","Internet traffic","greedy algorithm","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5195959","abstract":"Popular Web sites receive an enormous share of Internet traffic. These sites have a competitive motivation to offer better service to their clients at lower cost. One of the solutions is to using content distribution network (CDN). When we design a CDN we need to find proxy server placement to provide its clients with the best available performance while consuming as little resource as possible. This is an optimization problem. Among the solutions greedy algorithm yields better result with low computational cost. The drawback is that it is easy to trap in the local optimum. We propose genetic algorithm to solve this problem. We mathematically model the optimization problem and then give details about how to apply genetic algorithm to proxy server placement problem. Simulation results for a simple topology are presented for both greedy algorithm and genetic algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/INMW.2009.5195959","startPage":"193","endPage":"198","publicationTitle":"2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management-Workshops","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMW.2009.5195959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5195925","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management-Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174549/5195925/05195959.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization algorithms for proxy server placement in content distribution networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195959/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization algorithms for proxy server placement in content distribution networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5195959/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10813750","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"1-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization algorithms for proxy server placement in content distribution networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"rp033-52333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068672S","chronDate":"1-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174549","isNumber":"5195925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174549","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5195925","articleId":"5195959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5195975,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Lorenz","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Design Automation, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Lorenz","id":"37604448000"},{"name":"Georg Georgakos","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Georgakos","id":"37427417700"},{"name":"Ulf Schlichtmann","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Design Automation, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulf","lastName":"Schlichtmann","id":"37265854500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4596-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4595-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"5195975","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1765},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aging","Circuit analysis","Timing","Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Human computer interaction","Degradation","Delay","Threshold voltage","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital circuits","logic circuits","timing circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aging analysis","circuit timing","NBTI","HCI","complex digital circuits","aging-aware gate model","cell delay degradation","output slope degradation","negative bias temperature instability","hot carrier injection"]}],"abstract":"We present an aging analysis flow able to calculate the degraded circuit timing.

Gate oxide scaling can cause large transient gate leakage (a trap in the gate oxide), which is known as the erratic bits phenomena. Register file protection is necessary to prevent errors from quickly spreading to different parts of the system, which may cause applications to crash or silent data corruption. This paper proposes a simple and cost-effective mechanism that increases the resiliency of the register files to erratic bits. Our mechanism detects those registers that have erratic bits, recovers from the error and quarantines the faulty register. After the quarantine period, it is able to detect whether they are fully operational with low overhead.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2009.5195987","publicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5176124/5195974/05195987.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"86","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2009.5195987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5195974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5195987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online error detection and correction of erratic bits in register files","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195987/","displayDocTitle":"Online error detection and correction of erratic bits in register files","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5195987/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10826662","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online error detection and correction of erratic bits in register files","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"rps0013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090008S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5176124","isNumber":"5195974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5176124","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5195974","articleId":"5195987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5195988,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In addition, the use of checkpoint states avoids system downtime, since the synchronization of the recovered module is performed while the others are kept running. Experimental results show that the method has a reduced fault recovery time compared to the standard TMR implementation, maintaining the compatible area overhead and performance.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2009.5195990","publicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5176124/5195974/05195990.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5195974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2009.5195990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating large grain TMR and selective partial reconfiguration for soft error mitigation in SRAM-based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating large grain TMR and selective partial reconfiguration for soft error mitigation in SRAM-based FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5195990/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10826665","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating large grain TMR and selective partial reconfiguration for soft error mitigation in SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"rps0016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105087S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5176124","isNumber":"5195974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5176124","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5195974","articleId":"5195990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5195991,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Our model is based on a classic 6 transistor inner core SRAM cell and an outer core consisting of enhanced tri-state inverters. The outer core will absorb a particle strike at a sensitive node of the SRAM cell without a major impact on write time performance or area overhead. The model provides an on-demand protection due to the fact that the outer core can be shut off during non-essential operating mode. The on-demand aspect of the design provides a much more favorable power consumption overhead compared to the existing hardening technique. The gains in power consumption overhead reduction increase as we scale down the process technology from 90 nm to 32 nm. We simulated extensively our model and provided results for various energy levels of soft error protection. We also compared our method to the standard hardening technique in terms of layout area, performance and power consumption overhead for for 90 nm, 65 nm, 45 nm and 32 nm process technologies.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2009.5195992","publicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5176124/5195974/05195992.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2009.5195992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5195974","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5195992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SRAM cell design using tri-state devices for SEU protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5195992/","displayDocTitle":"SRAM cell design using tri-state devices for SEU protection","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5195992/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10826666","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM cell design using tri-state devices for SEU protection","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"rps0018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062588S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5176124","isNumber":"5195974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5176124","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5195974","articleId":"5195992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5195993,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we propose error control mechanisms at the symbol (probabilistic symbol remapping) and bit levels (code based correction and feedback) that allow more aggressive voltage overscaling than is possible otherwise. Error control feedback is used to continuously monitor and control the tuning knobs of the front end RF circuitry to trade off signal quality vs. power consumption. Real time image and voice data is used to demonstrate this concept. Significant power savings is achieved using the proposed scheme while maintaining minimum signal quality as required by the wireless communication link.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2009.5196024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2009.5196024","publicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th IEEE International On-Line Testing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5176124/5195974/05196024.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5195974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggressively voltage overscaled adaptive RF systems using error control at the bit and symbol levels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Aggressively voltage overscaled adaptive RF systems using error control at the bit and symbol levels","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10826653","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5196024/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggressively voltage overscaled adaptive RF systems using error control at the bit and symbol levels","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"rps0050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066742S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5176124","isNumber":"5195974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5176124","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5195974","articleId":"5196024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5196054,"authors":[{"name":"Ligia Chiorean","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ligia","lastName":"Chiorean","id":"37936423900"},{"name":"Mircea-Florin Vaida","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Mircea-Florin","lastName":"Vaida","id":"37282876800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-953-7138-15-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1330-1012"}],"articleNumber":"5196054","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"abstract":"The importance of information offered by the medical images for diagnosis support can be increased by combining images from different compatible medical devices.

Then we run the Mathematica program DiophantineGF.m. This program calculates the generating function from which is possible to find the number of solutions to the system of Diophantine equalities, which in fact gives the lower bound for the number of processors needed for the corresponding algorithm.

As a result, developers want to ensure that their SWIP sources are protected from being exposed to an unauthorized party and are restricted to run only on a trusted FPGA platform. This paper proposes a novel design flow for protecting SWIP by binding it to a specific FPGA platform. We accomplish this by leveraging the qualities of a physical unclonable function (PUF) and a tight integration of hardware and software security features. A prototype implementation demonstrates our design flow to successfully protect a SWIP by encryption using a 128 bit FPGA-unique key extracted from a PUF.","doi":"10.1109/SIES.2009.5196217","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174534/5196184/05196217.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIES.2009.5196217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5196184","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A flexible design flow for software IP binding in commodity FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196217/","displayDocTitle":"A flexible design flow for software IP binding in commodity FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5196217/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10814298","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible design flow for software IP binding in commodity FPGA","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"033-LF-000779.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081086S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174534","isNumber":"5196184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174534","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5196184","articleId":"5196217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5196218,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo de Castro","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Porta, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"de Castro","id":"37605288900"},{"name":"Rui Esteves Araujo","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Porta, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui Esteves","lastName":"Araujo","id":"37286035700"},{"name":"Hugo Oliveira","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Porta, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"Oliveira","id":"38000651500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4109-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4110-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-3109"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-3117"}],"articleNumber":"5196218","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric vehicles","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","field programmable gate arrays","induction motors","machine control","position control","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimotor electric vehicle","FPGA parallel processing","induction motor controller","field orientation control","space vector modulation","resource sharing strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Motion control","field programmable gate arrays","road vehicle electric propulsion","motor drives"]}],"abstract":"A new FPGA based platform is presented for controlling a multi-motor electric vehicle (EV).

Some markers are mounted on the vehicle so that the Vicon system can track it. The markers arrangement is stored once in the Vicon system. In practice, after a few flights the markers' configuration may be slightly altered causing offsets in the measurement of the true attitude of the quadrotor. The Vicon system itself may also measure the vehicle's attitude with some errors in the angles due to small displacements of the cameras and a long period of use without recalibration of the whole system. Since it would be very tedious and cumbersome to recalibrate the whole vision system and making sure that the markers arrangement is still valid before every flight, a simple method has been developed to accommodate any offset in the attitude measurements. Better flight performance is obtained using the method presented.","doi":"10.1109/SIES.2009.5196224","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5174534/5196184/05196224.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIES.2009.5196224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5196184","startPage":"261","endPage":"264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous quadrotor flight using a vision system and accommodating frames misalignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196224","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous quadrotor flight using a vision system and accommodating frames misalignment","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196224/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10814305","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5196224/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous quadrotor flight using a vision system and accommodating frames misalignment","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"040-LF-001228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043586S","chronDate":"8-10 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5174534","isNumber":"5196184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5174534","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5196184","articleId":"5196224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5196261,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The effectiveness of the proposed solution in presence of chromatic dispersion is experimentally verified by measuring the bit-error rate (BER) after 8.8 km of uncompensated standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). POLMUX and single channel transmission are also evaluated replacing the automatic polarization stabilizer by a manually adjustable fiber polarization controller (PC). The high sensitivity of the receiver apparatusto the received optical power is demonstrated using manually-adjusted PC (open-square). Due to the presence of optical crosstalk after polarization demultiplexing, the effect enhances in presence of the automatic SOP stabilizer.

Cautious design of delegation mechanism must be in place as a building block of cross-domain cooperation, since the cooperation inevitably involves exchanging and sharing relevant patient data that are considered highly private and confidential. The delegation mechanism grants permission to and restricts access rights of a cooperating partner. Patients are unwilling to accept the EHR system unless their health data are guaranteed proper use and disclosure, which cannot be easily achieved without cross-domain authentication and fine-grained access control. In addition, revocation of the delegated rights should be possible at any time during the cooperation. In this paper, we propose a secure EHR system, based on cryptographic constructions, to enable secure sharing of sensitive patient data during cooperation and preserve patient data privacy. Our EHR system further incorporates advanced mechanisms for fine-grained access control, and on-demand revocation, as enhancements to the basic access control offered by the delegation mechanism, and the basic revocation mechanism, respectively. The proposed EHR system is demonstrated to fulfill objectives specific to the cross-domain delegation scenario of interest.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Medical services","Permission","Access control","Data privacy","Hospitals","Authentication","Collaborative work","Sun","Medical treatment","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","data privacy","medical information systems","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-domain data sharing","distributed electronic health record systems","cross-domain cooperation","delegation mechanism","fine-grained access control","cryptographic constructions","sensitive patient data","patient data privacy","patient treatment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross domain","delegation","electronic health record","privacy","security."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2009.124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5550955/05196665.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2009.124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Domain Data Sharing in Distributed Electronic Health Record Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Domain Data Sharing in Distributed Electronic Health Record Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196665/","volume":"21","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5196665/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11476846","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Domain Data Sharing in Distributed Electronic Health Record Systems","sourcePdf":"ttd2010060754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076405S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5550955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5550955","articleId":"5196665","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5196673,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed K.

However, a crucial challenge in implementing cooperation protocols is how to select relay-source pairs. In this paper, we address this problem based on the knowledge of the users' spatial distribution which determines the channel statistics. We consider two scenarios at the destination node, when the receiver uses MRC and when no-MRC is used. First, we characterize the optimal relay location to minimize the outage probability. Then, we propose and analyze the performance of two schemes: a distributed nearest neighbor relay assignment in which users can act as relays, and an infrastructure-based relay-assignment protocol in which fixed relay nodes are deployed in the network to help the users forward their data. The outage probabilities of these two schemes are derived. We also derive universal lower bounds on the performance of relay-assignment protocols to serve as a benchmark for our proposed protocols. Numerical results reveal significant gains when applying the proposed simple distributed algorithms over direct transmission in terms of coverage area, transmit power, and spectral efficiency. At 1 percent outage probability, more than 200 percent increase in coverage area can be achieved, 7 dBW savings in the transmitted power, and the system can operate at 2 b/s/Hz higher spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5420335/05196673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420335","startPage":"505","endPage":"515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Relay-Assignment Protocols for Coverage Expansion in Cooperative Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Relay-Assignment Protocols for Coverage Expansion in Cooperative Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196673/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11151990","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5196673/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Relay-Assignment Protocols for Coverage Expansion in Cooperative Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2010040505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104723S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5420335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5420335","articleId":"5196673","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5196677,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Tuan Hoang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5392953/5196677/5196677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anh Tuan Hoang received the bachelor's degree (with first class honors) in telecommunications engineering from the University of Sydney in 2000 and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2005.

Both downlink and uplink transmission scenarios in the cognitive network are considered. For both scenarios, we propose two-phase mixed distributed/centralized control algorithms that require minimal cooperation between cognitive and primary devices. In the first phase, a distributed power updating process is employed at the cognitive and primary nodes to maximize the coverage of the cognitive network while always maintaining the constrained signal to interference plus noise ratio of primary transmissions. In the second phase, centralized channel assignment is carried out within the cognitive network to maximize its throughput.

The objective is to find an unknown number of corresponding graph structures in two images. We extract discriminative local primitives from both images and construct a candidacy graph whose vertices are matching candidates (i.e., a pair of primitives) and whose edges are either negative for mutual exclusion or positive for mutual consistence. Then we pose layered graph matching as a multicoloring problem on the candidacy graph and solve it using a composite cluster sampling algorithm. This algorithm assigns some vertices into a number of colors, each being a matched layer, and turns off all the remaining candidates. The algorithm iterates two steps: 1) Sampling the positive and negative edges probabilistically to form a composite cluster, which consists of a few mutually conflicting connected components (CCPs) in different colors and 2) assigning new colors to these CCPs with consistence and exclusion relations maintained, and the assignments are accepted by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mechanism to preserve detailed balance. This framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several applications, such as multi-object matching with large motion, shape matching and retrieval, and object localization in cluttered background.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Shape","Image sampling","Clustering algorithms","Image segmentation","Layout","Stereo vision","Monte Carlo methods","Application software","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","graph theory","image matching","image sampling","Markov processes","Monte Carlo methods","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layered graph matching","composite cluster sampling","candidacy graph","multicoloring problem","Markov chain Monte Carlo mechanism","conflicting connected components","multiobject matching","shape matching","shape retrieval","object localization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph matching","graph partitioning","DDMCMC","cluster sampling."]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5487331/05196680.pdf","startPage":"1426","endPage":"1442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5487331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered Graph Matching with Composite Cluster Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Layered Graph Matching with Composite Cluster Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196680/","volume":"32","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5196680/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11373244","pubMedId":"20558875","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered Graph Matching with Composite Cluster Sampling","sourcePdf":"ttp2010081426.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101024S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5487331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5487331","articleId":"5196680","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5196681,"authors":[{"name":"Naouel Moha","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique Campus de Beaulieu, Triskell Team, IRISA Universit\u00e9 Rennes 1, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/5401361/5196681/5196681-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naouel Moha received the master's degree in computer science from the University of Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, in 2002, and the PhD degree from the University of Montreal (under the supervision of Professor Yann-Ga\u00ebl Gu\u00e9h\u00e9neuc) and the University of Lille (under the supervision of Professors Laurence Duchien and Anne-Fran\u00e7oise Le Meur) in 2008.

They may hinder the evolution of a system by making it hard for software engineers to carry out changes. We propose three contributions to the research field related to code and design smells: (1) DECOR, a method that embodies and defines all the steps necessary for the specification and detection of code and design smells, (2) DETEX, a detection technique that instantiates this method, and (3) an empirical validation in terms of precision and recall of DETEX. The originality of DETEX stems from the ability for software engineers to specify smells at a high level of abstraction using a consistent vocabulary and domain-specific language for automatically generating detection algorithms. Using DETEX, we specify four well-known design smells: the antipatterns Blob, Functional Decomposition, Spaghetti Code, and Swiss Army Knife, and their 15 underlying code smells, and we automatically generate their detection algorithms. We apply and validate the detection algorithms in terms of precision and recall on XERCES v2.7.0, and discuss the precision of these algorithms on 11 open-source systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DECOR: A Method for the Specification and Detection of Code and Design Smells","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2009.50","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/5401361/05196681.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"36","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2009.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401361","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"DECOR: A Method for the Specification and Detection of Code and Design Smells","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5196681/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11162417","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DECOR: A Method for the Specification and Detection of Code and Design Smells","sourcePdf":"tts2010010020.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118198S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"5401361","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"372","xplore-issue":"5401361","articleId":"5196681","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":5196683,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Carrara","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e dei Sistemi, Facolt\u00e0 di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5233078/5196683/5196683-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Carrara (S'01\u2013M'03) received the Laurea degree in electrical engineering (cum laude) and Ph.D. degree in electronics and automation engineering from the University of Catania, Catania, Italy, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.","Since 1999, he has been with the Radio Frequency Advanced Design Center (RF-ADC), a joint research center supported by the University of Catania and STMicroelectronics, Catania, Italy, where he is currently a Research Assistant Professor.

Today, distance education represents an effective way for supporting and sometimes substituting the traditional formative processes, thanks to the technological improvements achieved in the field in recent years. However, the role of technology has often been overestimated. The amount of information students can obtain from the Internet is huge, and as a result, they can easily be confused. Teachers can also be disconcerted by this vast quantity of content and are often unable to suggest the correct content to their students. In the open scientific literature, it is widely recognized that an important factor for success in delivering learning content is related to the capability for customizing the learning process for the specific needs of a given learner. This task is still far from having been fully accomplished, and there is a real interest in investigating new approaches and tools to adapt the formative process to specific individual needs. In this scenario, the introduction of ontology formalism can improve the quality of the formative process, allowing the introduction of new and effective services. Ontologies can lead to important improvements in the definition of a course's knowledge domain, in the generation of an adapted learning path, and in the assessment phase. This paper provides an initial discussion of the role of ontologies in the context of e-learning. The improvements related to the introduction of ontologies formalism in the e-learning field are discussed, and a novel algorithm for ontology building through the use of Bayesian networks is shown. Finally, the application of this algorithm in the assessment process and some experimental results are illustrated.","doi":"10.1109/TE.2009.2012537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/5458332/05196690.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2009.2012537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5458332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ontology for E-Learning: A Bayesian Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Ontology for E-Learning: A Bayesian Approach","volume":"53","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11282326","htmlLink":"/document/5196690/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ontology for E-Learning: A Bayesian Approach","sourcePdf":"te-colace-2012537.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116864S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"5458332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5458332","articleId":"5196690","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5196691,"authors":[{"name":"Linda E.

With this approach, students are able to explore and gain experience of the different techniques used at each level of the design hierarchy and the problems in translating to the next level down.

Academics in higher education use questions on a daily basis to stimulate thinking and reasoning in students. Final examination papers are used by academics to assess the retention and application skills of students. The assumption, however, exists that questions relating to application skills at universities of technology should start to dominate the higher academic levels in education, with a subsequent drop in questions regarding retention skills. These questions may be categorized as either higher order or lower order questions. This article attempts to distinguish between these two types of questions in light of Bloom's taxonomy, with similar concepts such as deep and surface learning being examined. The literature review is applied to an electrical engineering module titled Electronics, which serves as the case study. The results of this study indicate that a high percentage of the final examination papers dealt with the objective \u00bfApplication,\u00bf where students had to make use of numerous mathematical equations to solve various unknowns. The results also indicated that academics in electronics are using more lower order than higher order questions in their final examination papers. A balance is suggested between these two types of questions for various academic levels at universities of technology.","doi":"10.1109/TE.2009.2014221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/5458332/05196692.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.2009.2014221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5458332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Final Examination Papers in Engineering: A Case Study Using Bloom's Taxonomy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196692","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196692/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Final Examination Papers in Engineering: A Case Study Using Bloom's Taxonomy","volume":"53","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11282329","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5196692/","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Final Examination Papers in Engineering: A Case Study Using Bloom's Taxonomy","sourcePdf":"te-aswart-2014221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053099S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"13","isNumber":"5458332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5458332","articleId":"5196692","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196698,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Yu Peng","affiliation":["Institute of Statistics, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chien-Yu Peng received the B.S. degree in Mathematics from Cheng-Kung University, then the M.S., and the Ph.D. degrees in Statistics from Tsing-Hua University, Taiwan.

The performance of a degradation model depends strongly on the appropriateness of the model describing a product's degradation path. In this paper, motivated by laser data, we propose a general linear degradation path in which the unit-to-unit variation of all test units can be considered simultaneously with the time-dependent structure in degradation paths. Based on the proposed degradation model, we first derive an implicit expression of a product's lifetime distribution, and its corresponding mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). By using the profile likelihood approach, maximum likelihood estimation of parameters, a product's MTTF, and their confidence intervals can be obtained easily. In addition, laser degradation data are used to illustrate the proposed procedure. Furthermore, we also address the effects of model mis-specification on the prediction of the product's MTTF. It shows that the effect of the model mis-specification on the predictions of a product's MTTF is not critical under the case of large samples. However, when the sample size and the termination time are not large enough, a simulation study shows that these effects are not negligible.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2009.2026784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2009.2026784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5230375","startPage":"444","endPage":"455","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5230375/05196698.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196698","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Life estimation","Life testing","Laser modes","Predictive models","Measurement standards","Light emitting diodes","Councils","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["misspecification analysis","linear degradation models","laser data","unit-to-unit variation","time-dependent structure","mean-time-to-failure","maximum likelihood estimation","confidence intervals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Degradation","first passage time","identifiability","model mis-specification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mis-Specification Analysis of Linear Degradation Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847420","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5196698/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196698/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mis-Specification Analysis of Linear Degradation Models","sourcePdf":"tr-tseng-2026784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077989S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"5230375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"234","xplore-issue":"5230375","articleId":"5196698","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5196704,"authors":[{"name":"Octavian A.

However, many of these technologies are brittle and do not adapt to the user's explicit or implicit wishes. Here, we introduce CASAS, an adaptive smart-home system that utilizes machine learning techniques to discover patterns in resident's daily activities and to generate automation polices that mimic these patterns. Our approach does not make any assumptions about the activity structure or other underlying model parameters but leaves it completely to our algorithms to discover the smart-home resident's patterns. Another important aspect of CASAS is that it can adapt to changes in the discovered patterns based on the resident implicit and explicit feedback and can automatically update its model to reflect the changes. In this paper, we provide a description of the CASAS technologies and the results of experiments performed on both synthetic and real-world data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/5208652/05196706.pdf","startPage":"949","endPage":"959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2025137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2025137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Keeping the Resident in the Loop: Adapting the Smart Home to the User","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart homes","Machine learning","Artificial intelligence","Computational intelligence","Competitive intelligence","Humans","Adaptive systems","Automation","Machine learning algorithms","User centered design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","home computing","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["center for advanced studies on adaptive systems","adaptive smart-home system","machine learning techniques","pattern discovery","resident daily activities","resident implicit feedback","resident explicit feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive systems","machine learning","smart environments","user-centered design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Keeping the Resident in the Loop: Adapting the Smart Home to the User","volume":"39","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5196706/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828549","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Keeping the Resident in the Loop: Adapting the Smart Home to the User","sourcePdf":"tsmca-cook-2025137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059185S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"5208652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"246","xplore-issue":"5208652","articleId":"5196706","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196714,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Here we report a novel optimization algorithm, group search optimizer (GSO), which is inspired by animal behavior, especially animal searching behavior. The framework is mainly based on the producer-scrounger model, which assumes that group members search either for ldquofindingrdquo (producer) or for ldquojoiningrdquo (scrounger) opportunities. Based on this framework, concepts from animal searching behavior, e.g., animal scanning mechanisms, are employed metaphorically to design optimum searching strategies for solving continuous optimization problems. When tested against benchmark functions, in low and high dimensions, the GSO algorithm has competitive performance to other EAs in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, especially on high-dimensional multimodal problems. The GSO algorithm is also applied to train artificial neural networks. The promising results on three real-world benchmark problems show the applicability of GSO for problem solving.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2009.2011992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5257407/05196714.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2009.2011992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5257407","startPage":"973","endPage":"990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group Search Optimizer: An Optimization Algorithm Inspired by Animal Searching Behavior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Group Search Optimizer: An Optimization Algorithm Inspired by Animal Searching Behavior","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10879795","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5196714/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group Search Optimizer: An Optimization Algorithm Inspired by Animal Searching Behavior","sourcePdf":"tevc-wu-2011992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15569S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5257407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"465","xplore-issue":"5257407","articleId":"5196714","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5196716,"authors":[{"name":"Masanobu Shimada","affiliation":["Earth Observation Research Center, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, Tsukuba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5332062/5196716/5196716-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masanobu Shimada (M'97\u2013SM'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in aeronautical engineering from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 1977 and 1979, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1999.","In 1979, he joined the National Space Development Agency of Japan [NASDA, currently known as the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)], Tsukuba, Japan, where he designed a NASDA scatterometer.

Considering also the complexity of distribution networks in terms of their topology and the presence of power system components and protection devices, the implementation of the LEMP-to-transmission-line coupling models into software tools used to represent the transient behavior of the entire network is of crucial importance. This paper reviews the most significant results obtained by the authors concerning the calculation of lightning-induced voltages. First, the theoretical basis of advanced models for the calculation of LEMP-originated transients in overhead power lines is illustrated; then, the relevant experimental validation using: 1) reduced-scale setups with LEMP and nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) simulators and 2) full-scale setups illuminated by artificially initiated lightning are reported. Finally, the paper presents comparisons between simulations and new experimental data consisting of measured natural lightning-induced voltages on a real distribution network in northern Italy, correlated with data from lightning location systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightning Electromagnetic Field Coupling to Overhead Lines: Theory, Numerical Simulations, and Experimental Validation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2009.2025958","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5208467/05196718.pdf","startPage":"532","endPage":"547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2009.2025958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5208467","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196718/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Lightning Electromagnetic Field Coupling to Overhead Lines: Theory, Numerical Simulations, and Experimental Validation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"51","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5196718/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10828843","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightning Electromagnetic Field Coupling to Overhead Lines: Theory, Numerical Simulations, and Experimental Validation","sourcePdf":"temc-paolone-2025958.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.20263S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5208467","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5208467","articleId":"5196718","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196720,"authors":[{"name":"Yujeong Shim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/5208461/5196720/5196720-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yujeong Shim (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, both in electrical engineering, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Her research interests include electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility susceptibility of analog integrated circuits (ICs) and chip\u2013package codesign of analog ICs and power distributed network of hierarchical chip\u2013package."]},"firstName":"Yujeong","lastName":"Shim","id":"37291565100"},{"name":"Jongbae Park","affiliation":["Silicon Image, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/5208461/5196720/5196720-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jongbae Park (S'05\u2013A'09) received the B.S. degree in avionics from the Korea Aerospace University, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","In 2008, he joined Silicon Image, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, where he is currently a Signal Integrity Staff Engineer in the Engineering Department.

In order to validate the proposed model, CMOS OpAmp was fabricated using TSMC 0.25 mum. Then the dc output offset voltage of the OpAmp was measured by sweeping the SSN frequency from 10 MHz up to 3 GHz. It was successfully demonstrated that the experimental results are consistent with the predictions generated using the proposed model. We also confirmed that the dc offset voltage is strongly dependent on the SSN frequency and the PDN impedance profile of the chip-package hierarchical PDN.

As the problem is strongly nondeterministic polynomial-time hard, only a few algorithms exist and the performance is still not satisfying. To design an effective algorithm for the MRCPSPDCF, this paper proposes an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach. ACO is promising for the MRCPSPDCF due to the following three reasons. First, MRCPSPDCF can be formulated as a graph-based search problem, which ACO has been found to be good at solving. Second, the mechanism of ACO enables the use of domain-based heuristics to accelerate the search. Furthermore, ACO has found good results for the classical single-mode scheduling problems. But the utility of ACO for the much more difficult MRCPSPDCF is still unexplored. In this paper, we first convert the precedence network of the MRCPSPDCF into a mode-on-node (MoN) graph, which becomes the construction graph for ACO. Eight domain-based heuristics are designed to consider the factors of time, cost, resources, and precedence relations. Among these heuristics, the hybrid heuristic that combines different factors together performs well. The proposed algorithm is compared with two different genetic algorithms (GAs), a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, and a tabu search (TS) algorithm on 55 random instances with at least 13 and up to 98 activities. Experimental results show that the proposed ACO algorithm outperforms the GA, SA, and TS approaches on most cases.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2027335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5314168/05196736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2027335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5314168","startPage":"64","endPage":"77","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Discounted Cash Flows in Project Scheduling\u2014An Ant Colony Optimization Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Discounted Cash Flows in Project Scheduling\u2014An Ant Colony Optimization Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"10959201","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5196736/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Discounted Cash Flows in Project Scheduling\u2014An Ant Colony Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-zhang-2027335.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12074S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5314168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5314168","articleId":"5196736","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196737,"authors":[{"name":"Charles-Alban Deledalle","affiliation":["Institut Telecom, CNRS LTCI, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5306041/5196737/5196737-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Charles-Alban Deledalle (S'08) received the engineering degree from Ecole Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avanc\u00e9es (EPITA) and the Science and Technology M.S. degree from the University Pierre et Marie Currie (Paris 6), Paris, France, in 2008.

This paper presents a new approach for image denoising in the case of a known uncorrelated noise model. The proposed filter is an extension of the nonlocal means (NL means) algorithm introduced by Buades, which performs a weighted average of the values of similar pixels. Pixel similarity is defined in NL means as the Euclidean distance between patches (rectangular windows centered on each two pixels). In this paper, a more general and statistically grounded similarity criterion is proposed which depends on the noise distribution model. The denoising process is expressed as a weighted maximum likelihood estimation problem where the weights are derived in a data-driven way. These weights can be iteratively refined based on both the similarity between noisy patches and the similarity of patches extracted from the previous estimate. We show that this iterative process noticeably improves the denoising performance, especially in the case of low signal-to-noise ratio images such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Numerical experiments illustrate that the technique can be successfully applied to the classical case of additive Gaussian noise but also to cases such as multiplicative speckle noise. The proposed denoising technique seems to improve on the state of the art performance in that latter case.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Weighted Maximum Likelihood Denoising With Probabilistic Patch-Based Weights","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2029593","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5306041/05196737.pdf","startPage":"2661","endPage":"2672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2029593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5306041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196737/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Weighted Maximum Likelihood Denoising With Probabilistic Patch-Based Weights","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5196737/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966844","pubMedId":"19666338","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Weighted Maximum Likelihood Denoising With Probabilistic Patch-Based Weights","sourcePdf":"tip-deledalle-2029593.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091602S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5306041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"467","xplore-issue":"5306041","articleId":"5196737","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5196741,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Small variations in the performances of the antenna for the clamshell mobile phone in the open state (talk condition) and closed state (idle condition) are obtained. This is owing to the reduced effects of the upper (cover) ground plane on the performances of the internal antenna obtained by embedding a slit at the edge of the upper ground plane close to the connecting strip between the two (upper and main) ground planes of the clamshell mobile phone. In this case, large surface currents excited around the slit are achieved, with other portions of the upper ground plane showing much weaker surface current distributions, which makes the embedded slit behaves like a current trap for the excited surface currents. This condition results in reduced effects of the upper ground plane. This also makes the near-field radiation of the clamshell mobile phone with the proposed antenna easily meet the specific absorption rate (SAR) and hearing aid compatibility (HAC) specifications required for practical applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5280584/05196743.pdf","startPage":"3303","endPage":"3308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2029612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2029612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5280584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internal WWAN Clamshell Mobile Phone Antenna Using a Current Trap for Reduced Ground Plane Effects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Mobile antennas","Impedance matching","3G mobile communication","Joining processes","Current distribution","Near-field radiation pattern","Specific absorption rate","Auditory system","Telephone sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna radiation patterns","cellular radio","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internal WWAN clamshell mobile phone antenna","wireless wide-area network","ground plane effects","GSM operation","UMTS operation","antenna radiation pattern","hearing aid compatibility"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clamshell mobile phone antennas","handset antennas","mobile antennas","reduced ground plane effects","WWAN antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Internal WWAN Clamshell Mobile Phone Antenna Using a Current Trap for Reduced Ground Plane Effects","volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5196743/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10917810","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internal WWAN Clamshell Mobile Phone Antenna Using a Current Trap for Reduced Ground Plane Effects","sourcePdf":"tap-wong-part1-2029612.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047167S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5280584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5280584","articleId":"5196743","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196746,"authors":[{"name":"M'hamed Drif","affiliation":["Department of Electrotechnics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene, Oran, Algeria","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/5196746/5196746-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["M\u2019hamed Drif (S'08\u2013M'09) was born in Sa\u00efda, Algeria, in 1964.

This paper presents a guideline for a simplified differential-mode (DM) filter design. First, a procedure to estimate the required filter attenuation based on the total input rms current using only a few equations is given. Second, a volume optimization of the needed DM filter based on the previously calculated filter attenuation and volumetric component parameters is introduced. It is shown that a minimal volume can be found for a certain optimal number of filter stages. The considerations are exemplified for two single-phase power factor correction converters operated in continuous and discontinuous conduction modes, respectively. Finally, EMI measurements done with a 300-W power converter prototype prove the proposed filter design method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5410131/05196754.pdf","startPage":"1031","endPage":"1040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2028293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2028293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guideline for a Simplified Differential-Mode EMI Filter Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Guidelines","Electromagnetic interference","Filters","Delta modulation","Attenuation","Switching converters","Standards development","Equations","Power factor correction","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic interference","power convertors","power factor correction","power filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic interference input filters design","switched power converters","regulatory standards","differential-mode filter design","filter attenuation estimation","DM filter volume optimization","volumetric component parameters","single-phase power factor correction converters","discontinuous conduction","power converter prototype","power 300 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design guideline","electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic interference (EMI)","noise estimation","volume optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Guideline for a Simplified Differential-Mode EMI Filter Design","volume":"57","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5196754/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11137561","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guideline for a Simplified Differential-Mode EMI Filter Design","sourcePdf":"tie-raggl-2028293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078886S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5410131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5410131","articleId":"5196754","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196757,"authors":[{"name":"Metin Aydin","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Kocaeli University, Izmit, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5352216/5196757/5196757-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Metin Aydin (S'98\u2013M'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 1993 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1997 and 2004, respectively.","He was with the Wisconsin Electrical Machines and Power Electronics Consortium, Madison, for eight years and the R&D Department, Caterpillar Inc., Peoria, IL, for two years, where he worked on various projects related to electric motor design and control.

A frequency response analysis technique provides valuable information of different electrochemical processes that occur inside the FC. The measurement system is implemented on a low-cost digital signal processor to perform frequency response and impedance tracking. The small-size and low-power consumption allows this special device to be embedded into the FC controller or power conditioning stage. The system is capable of measuring automatically the frequency response of the FC at different operating points, even when the FC is operating with a load. These measurements can be used to characterize the FC at the design stage and to perform online monitoring of the FC state during a continuous operation. The proposed instrument uses the lock-in amplification technique, which allows very accurate and precise measurements even in the presence of high noise levels. The proposed hardware and signal processing technique are described in this paper, including the experimental result of a 1.2-kW proton exchange membrane FC system.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2028295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2028295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463268","startPage":"1925","endPage":"1934","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5463268/05196759.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196759","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency response","Fuel cells","Monitoring","Frequency measurement","Performance evaluation","Robustness","Measurement techniques","Information analysis","Signal analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","condition monitoring","digital signal processing chips","frequency response","proton exchange membrane fuel cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded frequency response analyzer","fuel cell monitoring","proton exchange membrane fuel cells","electrochemical processes","digital signal processor","impedance tracking","power conditioning stage","online monitoring","lock-in amplification","signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency response","fuel cell (FC)","impedance","lock in","monitoring"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Embedded Frequency Response Analyzer for Fuel Cell Monitoring and Characterization","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11286119","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5196759/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196759/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Embedded Frequency Response Analyzer for Fuel Cell Monitoring and Characterization","sourcePdf":"tie-ordonez-2028295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103683S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5463268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5463268","articleId":"5196759","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":5196761,"authors":[{"name":"Zhili Lin","affiliation":["School of Instrument Science and Optoelectronic Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhili","lastName":"Lin","id":"37403764500"},{"name":"Lars Thylen","affiliation":["Department of Microelectronics and Applied Physics, Royal Institute of Technology, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Thylen","id":"37282061400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5196761","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dielectrics","Differential equations","Piecewise linear approximation","Transforms","Piecewise linear techniques","Convolution","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","dielectric materials","differential equations","finite difference time-domain analysis","numerical stability","permittivity","piecewise linear techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lorentz dielectrics","finite-difference time-domain approach","FDTD","auxiliary differential equation","bilinear transform","Z-transform","piecewise linear recursive convolution","electric flux density","electric field intensity","Courant stability limit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time domain (FDTD) methods","permittivity","numerical stability"]}],"abstract":"A rigorous and comparative study on the approximation accuracy and stability limits of several widely used finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approaches, namely the auxiliary differential equation (ADE) approach, the bilinear transform (BT) approach, the Z-transform approach (ZT) and the piecewise linear recursive convolution (PLRC) approach, for modeling dispersive Lorentz dielectrics is presented following the given updating equations between the electric flux density and the electric field intensity.

A fundamental processor component is the ARPA operating system (OS) coprocessor designed for hardware implementation of the basic real-time OS management functions, such as timing, task scheduling, synchronization and switching, efficient interrupt handling, and verification of the timing constraints. The hardware implementation of these functions allows executing them faster and more predictably, reducing the OS overhead, and improving its determinism.

There is a limitation for current measurements in the inverters. The measurements are executed in the effective voltages, not in the zero voltage. The current measured in the dc-link and then reconstructed to the phase value is used as a feedback value for controlling an ac machine. Here, there is a difference between the reconstructed current and measured currents at the top or bottom of PWM carrier such as in the conventional inverters. It changes according to the reference voltages, load conditions, noises, and disturbances. Next, it can cause deterioration of the performance of current control by increasing ripples in currents and torque. This paper analyzes the difference in the drives of a permanent magnet synchronous motor and proposes a method for reducing it. The proposed method predicts the currents measured at the fixed sampling points from those measured in the dc-link and the PWM patterns of voltage outputs. It can reduce current ripples and the experimental results verify it. It is applicable to the vapor compression refrigeration process with the low-cost and high-performance feature. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2028361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2028361","startPage":"716","endPage":"726","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5379132/05196775.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current Prediction in Vector-Controlled PWM Inverters Using Single DC-Link Current Sensor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Current Prediction in Vector-Controlled PWM Inverters Using Single DC-Link Current Sensor","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5196775/","accessionNumber":"11054653","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196775/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Prediction in Vector-Controlled PWM Inverters Using Single DC-Link Current Sensor","sourcePdf":"tie-ha-2028361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06145S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5379132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5379132","articleId":"5196775","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":5196776,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Hsuan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Hsuan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37696418500"},{"name":"Shih-Yuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Yuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277596400"},{"name":"Powen Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Powen","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37276890700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5196776","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1793},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Slot antennas","Polarization","Microstrip antennas","Bandwidth","Wireless LAN","Antenna measurements","Dipole antennas","Impedance","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","multifrequency antennas","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isosceles triangular slot antenna","broadband dual polarization applications","wide impedance bandwidth","wireless local area network applications","cross-polarization radiation level","diversity ports"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband antennas","dual-polarized antennas","slot antennas"]}],"abstract":"An isosceles triangular slot antenna is proposed for broadband dual polarization applications.

With the help of an illustrative example, it is shown that the general trend for DFAGs is to increase interarea oscillation damping. However, there are exceptions for certain penetration levels (not necessarily large), for which the voltage control (VC) option of DFAGs can reduce damping. It is also shown that the modulation of active power generation of wind turbines is a powerful tool to introduce additional damping to interarea oscillations through a simple wind power system stabilizer design. The general trend for increased oscillation damping is verified in the case of a large interconnected system encompassing Southeastern Europe for a projected high level of wind penetration in Greece. For the same system, it is also shown that low-damping voltage oscillations possibly introduced by the VC mode of DFAGs can be adequately damped by properly adjusting control parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contribution of Doubly Fed Wind Generators to Oscillation Damping","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2025330","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5224009/05196795.pdf","startPage":"783","endPage":"791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2025330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224009","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Contribution of Doubly Fed Wind Generators to Oscillation Damping","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5196795/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10846922","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contribution of Doubly Fed Wind Generators to Oscillation Damping","sourcePdf":"tec-tsourakis-2025330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091782S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5224009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"5224009","articleId":"5196795","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196814,"authors":[{"name":"Tarcisio F.

However, adaptive resource allocation (RA) in frequency, time, and space in multiuser MIMO-OFDMA systems is very complex due to the inclusion of the space dimension and the large number of resources to be managed. Indeed, an optimal RA for maximizing the sum rate is usually too complex for practical application, and suboptimal strategies are required. In this paper, the performance, complexity, and fairness of suboptimal RA strategies aiming at the maximization of the sum rate are investigated. A model for suboptimal RA strategies is proposed, and two new RA strategies are introduced. The proposed strategies are compared in terms of the sum rate, complexity, and throughput fairness and are shown to present better performance-complexity and performance-fairness tradeoffs than some existing suboptimal strategies, as well as to achieve almost the same sum rate as that obtained through an exhaustive search.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5383378/05196814.pdf","startPage":"406","endPage":"419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2029438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2029438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383378","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance, Complexity, and Fairness of Suboptimal Resource Allocation for Multiuser MIMO\u2013OFDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Multiaccess communication","Radio spectrum management","Frequency","System performance","MIMO","Wireless communication","Throughput","Laboratories","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal resource allocation","multiuser MIMO-OFDMA systems","multiple-input multiple-output systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","wireless communication systems","adaptive resource allocation","performance-complexity-performance-fairness tradeoff"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource allocation","sum rate maximization","throughput fairness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance, Complexity, and Fairness of Suboptimal Resource Allocation for Multiuser MIMO\u2013OFDMA Systems","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5196814/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11070323","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance, Complexity, and Fairness of Suboptimal Resource Allocation for Multiuser MIMO\u2013OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-maciel-2029438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12966S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5383378","articleId":"5196814","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196815,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An erbium-doped fiber amplifier is implemented in a simple and passive all-optical configuration known as optical gain-clamped optical amplifier (OA). The paper investigates the dynamic performance of the OA and discusses the interplay of amplifier dynamics with different traffic statistics. The investigation concerns exhaustive characterization of bit error rate performances under typical optical burst switching (OBS) traffic as well as special case of sudden power variation at the amplifier input. All obtained results show a reduction in the amplifier output power overshot compared to the case where the same OA operates without any gain stabilization technique. As an example, in the typical OBS traffic scenario, a reduction of 3 dB is observed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Optical fiber networks","Optical burst switching","Optical amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Gain control","Next generation networking","Optical fiber amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","gain control","optical burst switching","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical gain-clamped optical amplifier","optical burst switching networks","amplification gain control","optical networks","erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Er"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Burst traffic statistics","EDFA","optical amplifier gain stabilization","optical burst switching","optical gain clamping"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2029535","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5282655/05196815.pdf","startPage":"5475","endPage":"5482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2029535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Benefits of Optical Gain-Clamped Amplification in Optical Burst Switching Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Benefits of Optical Gain-Clamped Amplification in Optical Burst Switching Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196815/","volume":"27","issue":"23","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5196815/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10939185","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Benefits of Optical Gain-Clamped Amplification in Optical Burst Switching Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-zannin-2029535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055029S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5282655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5282655","articleId":"5196815","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5196819,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In systems such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), this benefit is obtained at the cost of greatly increased system complexity. Pre-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) combining techniques have been proposed by some researchers to obtain multiple antenna gains at a reduced complexity. However, existing works on pre-DFT combining ignore the specific distance properties of the underlying convolutional code, leading to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we develop a novel technique for pre-DFT combiner design for bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)-coded OFDM on Rayleigh block-fading channels. The combiner is designed for the specific code used and outperforms other known pre-DFT combining techniques. Our simulations show about a 2-3-dB improvement in performance over existing techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receiving antennas","Fading","Multipath channels","Diversity reception","Frequency division multiplexing","Costs","Fourier transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","discrete Fourier transforms","interleaved codes","multifrequency antennas","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pre-DFT combining","coded OFDM","fading multipath channels","multiple receive antennas","prediscrete Fourier transform combining techniques","bit-interleaved coded modulation","convolutional code","Rayleigh block-fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)","maximum ratio combining (MRC)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","single-input multiple-output (SIMO)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2029440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05196819.pdf","startPage":"5305","endPage":"5309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2029440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-DFT Combining for Coded OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pre-DFT Combining for Coded OFDM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196819/","volume":"58","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5196819/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10966644","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-DFT Combining for Coded OFDM","sourcePdf":"tvt-nagaraj-2029440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0531S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5196819","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5196821,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Vacondio","affiliation":["Center of Optics, Photonics and Laser (COPL), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5235152/5196821/5196821-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Vacondio was born on December 18, 1981 in Reggio Emilia, Italy.

We quantify the performance differences between the two receivers, allowing system designers and operators to determine when the less complex narrow filter receiver might be the appropriate choice. We numerically optimize the 3-dB bandwidth and center frequency of the narrow filter and show it is more robust to carrier frequency detuning than the conventional solution. We show that the narrow filter receiver is more tolerant to chromatic dispersion (CD) than the conventional one, and equally tolerant to first-order polarization-mode dispersion. We show the impact of the 3-dB bandwidth on the receiver performance when CD accumulates. Finally, we show via experiments and simulations that the 3 dB advantage of the conventional receiver vanishes when the nonlinear impairments are fiber nonlinearities; comparing the two receivers at the optimum launch power for a 25 times 80 km system, the difference in optical SNR margin is reduced to ~1.6 dB. Experiments are conducted at 42 Gb/s using a commercially available narrow filter for reception.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2029538","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5235152/05196821.pdf","startPage":"5106","endPage":"5114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2029538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5235152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DQPSK: When Is a Narrow Filter Receiver Good Enough?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196821/","displayDocTitle":"DQPSK: When Is a Narrow Filter Receiver Good Enough?","volume":"27","issue":"22","publicationDate":"Nov.15, 2009","accessionNumber":"10890527","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5196821/","dateOfInsertion":"25 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DQPSK: When Is a Narrow Filter Receiver Good Enough?","sourcePdf":"jlt-rusch-2029538.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104362S","chronDate":"Nov.15,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5235152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5235152","articleId":"5196821","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196827,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Feng Wu","affiliation":["VLSI Circuits and Systems Laboratory, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Feng","lastName":"Wu","id":"37419762500"},{"name":"Muh-Tian Shiue","affiliation":["Biomedical and Communication System IC Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Muh-Tian","lastName":"Shiue","id":"37267328400"},{"name":"Chorng-Kuang Wang","affiliation":["VLSI Circuits and Systems Laboratory, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chorng-Kuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280016800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5196827","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":691},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Carrier Synchronization and Equalization Algorithm for Packet-Based OFDM Systems Over the Multipath Fading Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Frequency synchronization","AWGN","Bit error rate","Frequency division multiplexing","Cost function","Mean square error methods","Jitter","Frequency locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","distortion","error statistics","fading channels","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","packet radio networks","synchronisation","timing jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint carrier synchronization algorithm","joint carrier equalization algorithm","packet-based OFDM systems","multipath frequency-selective fading channel","orthogonal frequency- division multiplexing systems","minimum mean-square-error criterion","cost function","uncoded bit error rate","carrier frequency jitter","multirate processing","dual-loop structure","frequency-tracking loop","phase offset","carrier frequency offset","time domain","phase- tracking loop","phase distortions","carrier frequency error","channel phase variation","frequency domain","gain equalization loop","magnitude distortion","closed-loop stability","loop delay","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","digital phase-locked loop (DPLL)","frequency-domain equalizer (FEQ)","minimum mean square error (MMSE)","signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a joint carrier synchronization and equalization algorithm is presented for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tracking</i>\n stage.

The algorithm has the ability to reorganize the model and adapt itself to a changing environment where both the structure and learning parameters are performed simultaneously. The network generates a new rule if the smallest distance between the new data and all the existing rules (the winner rule) is more than a prespecified radius. The major contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) A new network is proposed, in which unidimensional membership functions are used, and only two parameters for each rule are employed, thus reducing the number of parameters. The network avoids the singularity produced by the widths in the antecedent part for online learning; 2) a new pruning algorithm based on the density is proposed, where the density is the number of times each rule is used in the algorithm. The rule that has the smallest density (the looser rule) in a selected number of iterations is pruned if the value of its density is smaller than a prespecified threshold; and 3) the stability of the proposed algorithm is proven, and the bound for the average of the identification error is found. The condition that led the algorithm to avoid the local minimum is found, and it is proven that the parameter error is bounded by the initial parameter error. Three simulations give the effectiveness of the suggested algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2029569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5338640/05196829.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2009.2029569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5338640","startPage":"1296","endPage":"1309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOFMLS: Online Self-Organizing Fuzzy Modified Least-Squares Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5196829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SOFMLS: Online Self-Organizing Fuzzy Modified Least-Squares Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196829/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11000141","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5196829/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOFMLS: Online Self-Organizing Fuzzy Modified Least-Squares Network","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-rubio-2029569.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091821S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5338640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"253","xplore-issue":"5338640","articleId":"5196829","onlineDate":"07 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5196832,"authors":[{"name":"Reinhold Noe","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Reinhold","lastName":"Noe","id":"37268699000"},{"name":"Benjamin Koch","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Koch","id":"37319382000"},{"name":"Vitali Mirvoda","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Vitali","lastName":"Mirvoda","id":"37281674900"},{"name":"Ariya Hidayat","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany","Nokia Qt Software, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Ariya","lastName":"Hidayat","id":"37268698500"},{"name":"David Sandel","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Sandel","id":"37268695800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5196832","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":183},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical polarization","Optical fiber polarization","Optical control","Optical retarders","High speed optical techniques","Automatic control","Communication system control","Error correction","Optical devices","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light polarisation","lithium compounds","optical tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband endless optical polarization tracking","automatic endless optical polarization tracking","mean/maximum polarization errors","small-signal control","time constant","wavelength 1505 nm to 1570 nm","LiNbO3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","optical fiber polarization","quadrature phase-shift keying (PSK)"]}],"abstract":"We demonstrate automatic endless optical polarization tracking over 3.8 Grad at up to 38-krad/s control speed with mean/maximum polarization errors of 0.068/0.185 rad.

But most traditional IDS can only detect either misuse or anomaly attacks. In this paper, we propose a method combining artificial immune technique and principal components analysis (PCA) neural networks to construct an intrusion detection model capable of both anomaly detection and misuse detection. Initially an artificial immune system detects anomalous network connections. In order to attain more detailed information about an intrusion, PCA is applied for classification and neural networks are used for online computing. The experiments and evaluations of the proposed method were performed with the KDD Cup 99 intrusion detection dataset, which have information on computer network, during normal behavior and intrusive behavior. Results indicate the high detection accuracy for intrusion attacks and low false alarm rate of the reliable system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5196985/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10806670","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5196985/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","conferenceDate":"18-19 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Model Based on Artificial Immune System and PCA Neural Networks for Intrusion Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Model Based on Artificial Immune System and PCA Neural Networks for Intrusion Detection","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"3699a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053007S","chronDate":"18-19 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5196970","isNumber":"5196971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5196970","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5196971","articleId":"5196985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5197005,"authors":[{"name":"Qingling Zhao","affiliation":["College of fundamental Teaching, Sichuan Normal University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qingling","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37088253138"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3699-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5197005","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Information processing","Educational institutions","Education","Computational intelligence","Artificial intelligence","Stochastic processes","Birds","Artificial neural networks","Cultural differences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","convergence","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["niche particle swarm optimization","self-adaptive radius technology","computational intelligence technique","premature convergence","slow convergence","niche technology","niche population","fitness value","Ackley function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","Niche","Self-adaptive radius"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5197005","abstract":"The particle swarm optimization (PSO) first proposed by Eberhart and Kennedy, is a computational intelligence technique.

The VM scalability evaluation under these three workloads will help cloud users to understand the performance impact of underlying system and network architectures. We demonstrate that VMs on the state-of-the-art multi-core processor based systems scale as well as multiple threads on native SMP kernel for CPU and memory intensive workloads. Intra-VM communication of network I/O intensive TCP message workload has a lower overhead compared to multiple threads when VMs are pinned to specific cores. However, VM scalability is severely limited for such workloads for across-VM communication on a single host due to virtual bridges. For across local and wide area network communication, the network bandwidth is the limiting factor. Unlike previous studies that use workload mixes, we apply a single workload type at a time to clearly attribute VM scalability bottlenecks to system and network architectures or virtualization itself.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Machine Scalability on Multi-Core Processors Based Servers for Cloud Computing Workloads","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2009.20","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197282/5197283/05197304.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2009.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5197283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5197304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5197304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Machine Scalability on Multi-Core Processors Based Servers for Cloud Computing Workloads","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5197304/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10813078","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Machine Scalability on Multi-Core Processors Based Servers for Cloud Computing Workloads","confLoc":"Zhangjiajie, China","sourcePdf":"3741a090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049019S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197282","isNumber":"5197283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197282","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5197283","articleId":"5197304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5197327,"authors":[{"name":"Menghao Su","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Menghao","lastName":"Su","id":"37402527600"},{"name":"Xiang Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403256200"},{"name":"Yunji Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunji","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293328300"},{"name":"Qi Liu","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37403285900"},{"name":"Longbing Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Longbing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280181100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3741-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5197327","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Bandwidth","Delay","Quality of service","Processor scheduling","Shape control","Channel allocation","Computer architecture","Filtering","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","processor scheduling","quality of service","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficiency-aware QoS DRAM scheduler","SoC","system-on-chip","heterogeneous function units","memory access requirements","memory subsystem","quality of service","saturation point"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5197327","abstract":"For most SoCs, off-chip DRAM is an important resource that is shared by many heterogeneous function units(FU).To meet different memory access requirements by these FUs,it is crucial that the memory subsystem is capable of providing different quality of service(QoS).Due to the nature of DRAM, the available bandwidth greatly depends on the memory access sequence. However,conventional schedulers are not aware of the variable bandwidth.In this paper, a QoS scheduler is proposed by recognizing the inefficiency caused by ongoing memory accesses.The experimental results show that, the scheduler can provide bandwidth guarantee for bandwidth sensitive FUs even in the worst case scenarios.

The reason for that is that correlated data in terms of pilot tones are typically introduced on different carriers for channel estimation and synchronization purposes.

This paper explores whether additional redundancy for wireless channels is most helpful at the packet level through erasure coding or at the physical layer through lower-rate channel coding. This cross-layer trade-off is explored in a traditional wireless setting where the communication of a message consisting of a fixed number of packets takes place over a Rayleigh fading channel. The examined scenarios include both a single receiver and multiple cooperating receivers allowing the results to be extended to situations where selection diversity is available in the system. For several interesting scenarios, this paper determines the optimal trade-off between the amount of packet-level erasure coding and physical-layer channel coding required to provide reliable communication over the widest range of operating SNR's. Our results indicate that packet-level erasure coding can provide a significant benefit when no other form of diversity is available. In many cases, the amount of redundancy that should be allocated to such erasure coding is nearly constant, and further redundancy (i.e. any rateless coding) should be applied to the physical layer.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198588","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198588.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cross-Layer Perspective on Rateless Coding for Wireless Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Cross-Layer Perspective on Rateless Coding for Wireless Channels","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198588/","accessionNumber":"10815441","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198588/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cross-Layer Perspective on Rateless Coding for Wireless Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-13-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044998S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5198589,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The multiple CFO make the channel time-varying, and thus the conventional space-time codes to collect diversity gain for co-located multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems may not be applied directly. In a previous paper, we proposed a distributed space-frequency code (SFC), called frequency-reversal SFC (FR-SFC), for cooperative transmissions with multiple CFOs and flat fading channels. We have shown that this code can achieve the full cooperative diversity with only linear receivers, such as zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. However, the code is not bandwidth efficient when the relay nodes are more than 3. To have a higher bandwidth efficiency, in this paper we propose a new distributed SFC called frequency-domain linear convolutive SFC (FLC-SFC). The symbol rates of the new codes approach 1 when code block length is sufficiently larger than the number of relay nodes. Furthermore. It achieves the full cooperative diversity with linear receivers.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198597","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198597.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Linear Convolutive Space-Frequency Coding for Cooperative Communication Systems with Multiple Frequency Offsets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Linear Convolutive Space-Frequency Coding for Cooperative Communication Systems with Multiple Frequency Offsets","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198597/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814707","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198597/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Linear Convolutive Space-Frequency Coding for Cooperative Communication Systems with Multiple Frequency Offsets","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-02-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071704S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198612,"authors":[{"name":"R.

FFR is a promising resource allocation technique that can effectively mitigate inter-cell interference (ICI) in OFDMA networks. The proposed scheme enhances the conventional FFR by enabling adaptive spectral sharing per cell load conditions. Such adaptation has significant benefits in a practical environment where traffic load in different cells may be asymmetric and time-varying. The dynamic feature is accomplished via a graph approach in which the resource allocation problem is translated to a graph coloring problem. Specifically, in order to incorporate various versions of FFR in our framework, we construct a graph that matches the specific version of FFR and then color the graph using the corresponding graph algorithm. The performance improvement enabled by the proposed dynamic FFR scheme is further demonstrated by computer simulation for a 19-cell network with asymmetric cell load. For instance, the proposed dynamic FFR scheme can achieve a 12% and 33% gain in cell throughput and service rate over conventional FFR, and render a 70% and 107% gain in cell throughput and service rate with respect to the reuse-3 system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198612.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Graph Approach to Dynamic Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) in Multi-Cell OFDMA Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Resource management","Throughput","USA Councils","Telecommunication traffic","Radio spectrum management","Frequency conversion","WiMAX","Communications Society","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","graph colouring","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic fractional frequency reuse","multi-cell OFDMA networks","resource allocation technique","inter-cell interference","adaptive spectral sharing","graph coloring"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Graph Approach to Dynamic Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) in Multi-Cell OFDMA Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198612/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814834","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Graph Approach to Dynamic Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) in Multi-Cell OFDMA Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-29-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042501S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5198613,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The first stage of the technique is to dynamically allocate codes to the users so that the combination of instantaneous data and user cross correlations yield a favourable constructive to destructive multiple access interference (MAI) ratio. To further optimize the received signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), the second stage is to employ a dynamic, partial transmitter based pre-decorrelation scheme specifically designed for the exploitation of constructive MAI. The decorrelation processing is targeted to the destructive interferers, while users that interfere constructively are let correlated. This results in a significant SINR enhancement without the need for additional power-per-user investment. Mathematical analysis and simulations show that significant bit error rate (BER) performance benefits can be achieved with this technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198617.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid MC-CDMA Precoding Scheme Employing Code Hopping and Partial Beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Array signal processing","Multiple access interference","Signal to noise ratio","Phase shift keying","Bit error rate","Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Design optimization","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","code division multiple access","correlation methods","linear codes","phase shift keying","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid MC-CDMA precoding scheme","code hopping","partial beamforming","hybrid transmission technique","code optimization","partial linear precoding","downlink phase shift keying","mulitcarrier code division multiple access","cross correlation","multiple access interference","pre-decorrelation scheme","bit error rate","mathematical analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid MC-CDMA Precoding Scheme Employing Code Hopping and Partial Beamforming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198617/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815569","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid MC-CDMA Precoding Scheme Employing Code Hopping and Partial Beamforming","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-07-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035686S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198618,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, its complexity is quadratic in the number of transmitting antennas instead of exponential. Moreover, we show that the K-Best T-LORD is robust also over realistic channels, with correlation between tones and antennas, and with imperfect channel state Information at the receiver.

This method is based on bit level belief propagation (BP) decoding. In order to make BP decoding effective for RS codes, we use an extended binary parity check matrix with a lower density and reduced number of 4-cycles compared to the original binary parity check matrix of the code. In our proposed method, we take advantage of the cyclic structure of RS codes. Based on this property, we can apply the belief propagation algorithm on any cyclically shifted version of the received symbols with the same binary parity check matrix. For each shifted version of received symbols, the geometry of the factor graph will change and deterministic errors can be avoided. Our method results in considerable performance improvement of RS codes compared to hard decision decoding. The performance is also superior to some popular soft decision decoding methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198625","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198625.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Iterative Technique for Soft Decision Decoding of Reed-Solomon Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198625/","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Iterative Technique for Soft Decision Decoding of Reed-Solomon Codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814839","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198625/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Iterative Technique for Soft Decision Decoding of Reed-Solomon Codes","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-22-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051803S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5198626,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Not only are these protocols still evolving, they are also increasingly demanding in terms of throughput and real-time requirements. In order to support a careful application-driven architecture development, reference applications are required that expose the full system and enable the quantitative evaluation of performance-flexibility tradeoffs. For this purpose, we have captured the 802.11n MAC protocol in an executable reference application which comprises the system function and its environment including traffic scenarios. We model the reference in Click, a packet processing framework. The functionally-correct model captures performance-relevant aspects such as the wireless protocol timing exactly. Leveraging extensions to Click we can use the model for the development and deployment of embedded architectures. Our 802.11n MAC model comprises between 118 and 1238 functional elements and can be simulated in real time depending on the scenario. Due to its modularity, additional scenarios can be added productively.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198631","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198631.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modular Reference Application for IEEE 802.11n Wireless LAN MACs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Modular Reference Application for IEEE 802.11n Wireless LAN MACs","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198631/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814992","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198631/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modular Reference Application for IEEE 802.11n Wireless LAN MACs","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"03-10-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074425S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198636,"authors":[{"name":"N.

In particular, a new preamble pattern is used for both coarse timing and channel estimation. Despite of the presence of coarse timing error, the estimated channel impulse response (CIR) is simply the cyclic shifted version of the real CIR, thanks to the unique structure of the preamble. Then a new method is proposed to search for the first channel tap in the CIR vector, which can be employed to fine tune the timing position and adjust the channel estimation for later data block detection. The proposed scheme has low complexity, saves preamble overhead by performing joint synchronization and channel estimation, and outperforms existing timing acquisition methods in the literature by a large margin in dense multipath UWB channels. Moreover, this paper presents an analysis of the effect of residual timing error on the performance of single carrier systems with frequency domain equalization.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198641.pdf","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Joint Timing and Channel Estimation Method for Block Transmission UWB Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198641","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Joint Timing and Channel Estimation Method for Block Transmission UWB Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198641/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10815216","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198641/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Joint Timing and Channel Estimation Method for Block Transmission UWB Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-13-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04552S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5198659,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This paper proposes a cross-layer protocol which involves interaction between the physical (PHY) and the medium-access-control (MAC) layers, for ensuring politeness of the high-priority users toward the low-priority users for uplink transmission in home PLC networks. This protocol modifies the contention-based CSMA protocol of the MAC layer to exploit the cyclostationarity of the noise in home PLC networks. The PLC noise spectrum has been shown in literature to be periodic with the period of AC line cycle. Using this periodicity, the proposed protocol allows longer medium-access times for low-priority users in every AC line cycle, while meeting the high throughput requirements of the high-priority users. The proposed cross-layer protocol, termed opportunistic CSMA, improves the throughput of the low-priority users by as much as 300% compared to the current CSMA protocols in home PLC networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Polite Cross-Layer Protocol for Contention-Based Home Power-Line Communications","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198659","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198659.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Polite Cross-Layer Protocol for Contention-Based Home Power-Line Communications","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198659/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815597","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Polite Cross-Layer Protocol for Contention-Based Home Power-Line Communications","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"08-03-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085728S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5198664,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The structure of this SDR depends on the signaling scheme, and we will focus on 16-QAM signaling. The key step in the development of the first two demodulators is the derivation of polynomial expressions for the extrinsic information provided by the decoder. These expressions enable this information to be incorporated into the SDR framework. The resulting \"List-SDR\" demodulators require one semidefinite program (SDP) to be solved at each demodulation-decoding iteration. In the proposed \"Single-SDR\" demodulator this requirement is reduced to one SDP per channel use by deriving an approximation of the randomization procedure used by the List-SDR demodulator and showing that this approximation enables the decoupling of the processing of the channel measurement from that of the extrinsic information from the decoder. Simulation results show that the proposed demodulators provide considerable reductions in computational cost over several existing soft demodulators, and that these reductions are obtained without incurring a substantial degradation in performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semidefinite Relaxation Approach to Efficient Soft Demodulation of MIMO 16-QAM","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198668","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198668.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Semidefinite Relaxation Approach to Efficient Soft Demodulation of MIMO 16-QAM","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198668/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815599","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semidefinite Relaxation Approach to Efficient Soft Demodulation of MIMO 16-QAM","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-01-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07692S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198671,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This provides a good approximation to the optimal solution with lower complexity. This technique requires that a kernel signal be computed and iteratively shifted in the time-domain to the peak locations to reduce the PAPR. The kernel signal should be updated dynamically for the best performance in time varying channels, which increases the computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a low complexity gradient algorithm for computing the peak reduction kernels. This approach is more efficient than the previous algorithm, and provides better PAPR performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simplified Suboptimal Algorithm for Tone Reservation OFDM","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198672","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198672.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Simplified Suboptimal Algorithm for Tone Reservation OFDM","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198672/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815358","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simplified Suboptimal Algorithm for Tone Reservation OFDM","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-13-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069751S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198675,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Since far-end crosstalk (FEXT) is the major impairment in DSL systems based on frequency division duplexing, mitigation of this interference can increase the signal- to-interference-and-noise ratio, and therefore significantly boost the data rate. For simulation and evaluation of FEXT cancellation algorithms, more accurate modelling of the multiple-input- multiple-output (MIMO) crosstalk channels is needed. Until now, DSL standards usually rely on the 99% worst case modelling of crosstalk power-sum for the lines in a binder. This paper proposes a parametric stochastic FEXT model based on the sum-of-sinusoids approach for the pair-to-pair crosstalk among multiple lines in a binder, which shows a more realistic behaviour than the worst case models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Stochastic MIMO Model for Far-End Crosstalk in VDSL Cable Binders","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198675","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198675.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Stochastic MIMO Model for Far-End Crosstalk in VDSL Cable Binders","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198675/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815359","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Stochastic MIMO Model for Far-End Crosstalk in VDSL Cable Binders","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-13-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05554S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198676,"authors":[{"name":"Zeyu Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Zeyu Zheng","id":"37087669889"},{"name":"Jianping Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jianping Wang","id":"37087275649"},{"name":"Jin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China","Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jin Wang","id":"37087668276"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3435-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-3607"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1883"}],"articleNumber":"5198676","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5803},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Optical fiber networks","Peer to peer computing","Passive optical networks","Interference","Wireless communication","Bandwidth","IP networks","Telecommunication traffic","Optical network units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","optical fibre networks","peer-to-peer computing","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network throughput gain","optical-wireless networks","FiWi network","peer-to-peer communications","access network architecture","passive optical networks","wireless mesh networks","Internet access","PON subnetwork","wireless subnetwork","wireless-optical-wireless communication mode"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198676","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198676","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","abstract":"Optical-Wireless (FiWi) access network is a newly emerged access network architecture which integrates passive optical networks (PONs) with wireless mesh networks (WMNs) to provide the ubiquitous, low cost, high bandwidth last mile Internet access. Though the PON subnetwork of FiWi network can provide high bandwidth, the interference in the wireless subnetwork still limits the throughput of FiWi network if all traffic goes online to the Internet. However, when peer-to-peer communication from one wireless client to another wireless client is introduced, the proposed integration of PONs and WMNs can significantly improve the network throughput. In traditional WMNs, peer-to-peer communication from one wireless client to another wireless client is carried in the wireless network, which is subject to interferences in wireless communications. In FiWi network, peer-to-peer communication can be carried through the wireless-optical-wireless mode in which the traffic is sent from the source wireless client to its nearest ONU, which is then sent to the ONU close to the destination wireless client through the PON subnetwork and then delivered to the destination wireless client. Such wireless-optical-wireless communication mode introduced by FiWi networks can sustain the interference in wireless subnetwork, thus improving the network throughput. This paper aims to study the network throughput gain in FiWi network subject to peer-to-peer communications and parameters which can affect the network throughput gain. We first have a fair modeling of FiWi networks and traditional WMNs. We then present an LP based routing algorithm for FiWi networks. Extensive simulations have been carried to study the network throughput gain in FiWi networks subject to peer-to-peer communications compared with traditional WMNs. The work provides insightful observations for fully utilizing advantages brought by the integration of PONs and WMNs in FiWi networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198676.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Network Throughput Gain in Optical-Wireless (FiWi) Networks Subject to Peer-to-Peer Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198676/","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Network Throughput Gain in Optical-Wireless (FiWi) Networks Subject to Peer-to-Peer Communications","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814869","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Network Throughput Gain in Optical-Wireless (FiWi) Networks Subject to Peer-to-Peer Communications","confLoc":"Dresden","sourcePdf":"07-08-16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065618S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":5198678,"authors":[{"name":"K.-L.

The fact that we could show such good results for large STBCs (e.g., 16times16 STBC from cyclic division algebras) operating at spectral efficiencies in excess of 20 bps/Hz (even after accounting for the overheads meant for pilot-based channel estimation and turbo coding) establishes the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198683.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Training-Based Iterative Detection/Channel Estimation Scheme for Large Non-Orthogonal STBC MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Detectors","Bit error rate","Turbo codes","Performance loss","Fading","Slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","channel estimation","convergence","error statistics","iterative decoding","MIMO communication","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["training-based iterative detection scheme","training-based channel estimation scheme","nonorthogonal STBC MIMO systems","nonorthogonal space-time block coded systems","transmit antennas","convergence","iterative methods","bit error rate","nearness-to-capacity performance","spectral efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Training-Based Iterative Detection/Channel Estimation Scheme for Large Non-Orthogonal STBC MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198683/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815477","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Training-Based Iterative Detection/Channel Estimation Scheme for Large Non-Orthogonal STBC MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-01-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055214S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198703,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We have extended our prior approach by introducing multidimensional probability density components to represent class density using an adaptive mixture of such components. The number of components in the adaptive mixture algorithm, as well as the values of the parameters of the density components, is estimated from the data. The network utilizes a recursive version of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to minimize the Kullback-Leibler information metric by means of stochastic approximation combined with a rule for creation of new components. Learning occurs incrementally in order to allow the system to take advantage of increasing amounts of data without having to take the system offline periodically to update models. Continuous incremental learning enables the models of normal behavior to adapt well to evolving situations while maintaining high levels of performance. In addition, the adaptive mixtures neural network classifies streaming track data as normal or deviant. These capabilities contribute to higher-level fusion situational awareness and assessment objectives by enabling a shift of operator focus from sensor monitoring and activity detection to assessment and response. Our overall motion pattern learning approach learns behavioral patterns at a variety of conceptual, spatial, and temporal levels to reduce massive amounts of track data to a rich set of information regarding operator field of regard that supports rapid decision-making and timely response initiation.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198703","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198703.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Mixture-Based Neural Network Approach for Higher-Level Fusion and Automated Behavior Monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Computerized monitoring","Tracking","Motion detection","Multidimensional systems","Approximation algorithms","Stochastic processes","Sensor fusion","Decision making"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","multidimensional signal processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive mixture-based neural network","higher-level fusion","automated behavior monitoring","multidimensional probability density components","expectation maximization algorithm","stochastic approximation","adaptive normalcy learning","anomaly detection","homeland security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Mixture-Based Neural Network Approach for Higher-Level Fusion and Automated Behavior Monitoring","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198703/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814874","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Mixture-Based Neural Network Approach for Higher-Level Fusion and Automated Behavior Monitoring","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"08-01-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058361S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198704,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In the proposed structure, the data is encoded with the lowest available code rate then it is divided among different resource blocks (tiles) where it is punctured adaptively based on some measure of the channel quality for each tile. The proposed scheme is compared against using multiple codewords (MCWs) where the transmitter divides the data over tiles and encodes them separately. We investigate two different adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) selection methods. The first is a recursive scheme that operates directly on the SNR whereas the second operates on the effective SNR value that is obtained using Mutual Information Effective SNR Mapping (MIESM). We then compare our scheme to Per-Frame Adaptation (PFA) where we fix the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) over a given frame. We show via simulations that when using the recursive rate selection method the SCW scheme significantly outperforms the MCWs and the PFA. It is also shown that applying the MIESM rate selection method, the PFA improves significantly, yet the SCW scheme is the best performer. We also introduce a novel interleaving method prior to puncturing that improves the performance for certain restricted adaptation mechanisms.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198706","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198706.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Puncturing for Coded OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Puncturing for Coded OFDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198706/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815016","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198706/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Puncturing for Coded OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-13-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046747S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5198707,"authors":[{"name":"N.

For an uplink MC-CDMA system, the symbols of different users are spread in the frequency domain. However, the frequency-selective fading of wireless channels destroys the othogonality of the spreading codes for different users and causes multiple access interference (MAI), especially for a network with full load. To reduce the impact of MAI, we adaptively assign spreading codes according to channel state information and MAI environments. Since it requires high computational complexity to find an optimal set of spreading codes for all active users, we develop several simplified approaches to search the suboptimal spreading code sets. It is demonstrated by the computer simulation that the adaptive spreading code assignment, even though suboptimal, can significantly improve the performance of MC-CDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198709","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Spreading Code Assignment for Up-Link MC-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Spreading Code Assignment for Up-Link MC-CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198709/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815621","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198709/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Spreading Code Assignment for Up-Link MC-CDMA","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-40-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057664S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198711,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A statistical network anomaly detection algorithm is a promising way of detecting such anomalies, however, it has to be given appropriate parameters for accurate detection and identification. In general, it is very difficult to obtain appropriate parameter settings a priori, because network traffic is not stable in time or space. Thus, although many anomaly detection methods have been proposed, there has been little discussion about their parameter tunings. In this paper, we investigate an automatic and dynamic parameter tuning of a statistical network traffic anomaly detection method. In particular, we clarify whether one can consistently use the best parameter fixed for a certain instance; this choice clearly depends on the macroscopic and dynamic behavior of Internet traffic anomalies. We ascertain the appropriate learning period for setting a parameter of an anomaly detection algorithm based on a sketch and multi-scale gamma-function model by using real network traces measured in a trans-Pacific link over a period of six months. The main results of our study are as follows: (1) Without learning, the best parameter varies day by day. (2) With a longer learning period, the best parameter setting is affected by significant data during the learning period. (3) The appropriate period of the learning is about 3 days. (4) The performance degradation from introducing dynamic parameter tuning is 17% in the best case.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198722","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198722.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automatic and Dynamic Parameter Tuning of a Statistics-Based Anomaly Detection Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Automatic and Dynamic Parameter Tuning of a Statistics-Based Anomaly Detection Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198722/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815250","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198722/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automatic and Dynamic Parameter Tuning of a Statistics-Based Anomaly Detection Algorithm","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-15-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060214S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5198729,"authors":[{"name":"C.-L.

As compared to previous cooperative MIMO schemes for WSNs, the proposed one achieves higher energy efficiency and has a smaller critical distance above which cooperative MIMO/SIMO outperforms single-input single-output (SISO). The proposed optimization method is further extended to a clustered multi-hop WSN scenario. Through joint optimization of the number of transmitter antennas, the number of receiver antennas, the constellation size, and the hop length, we derive an energy-efficient clustered cooperative SIMO multi-hop scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme not only reduces the overall energy consumption but also balances the energy consumption among clusters.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198729","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198729.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198729","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Cooperative SIMO Transmission Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198729","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Cooperative SIMO Transmission Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198729/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198729/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815634","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Efficient Cooperative SIMO Transmission Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01-18-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064476S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198733,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Efficient transmission in OFDMA networks requires optimal resource allocation to users based on their current channel states. Also, utility-based resource allocation improves the network resource utilization and application level quality of service (QoS) provisioning. However, a major difficulty in using utility-based OFDMA resource allocation schemes is the non-convexity of corresponding optimization problem. In this paper, a continuous optimization technique is proposed to treat the non-convexity. The approach is based on a combination of penalty function methods and interior point methods. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach solves the problem within limited time, and the solutions are close to near optimal solutions obtained by the search algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198735","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198735.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Interior Point Penalty Method for Utility Maximization Problems in OFDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198735","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Interior Point Penalty Method for Utility Maximization Problems in OFDMA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198735/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815638","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198735/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Interior Point Penalty Method for Utility Maximization Problems in OFDMA Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-11-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054735S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198736,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Assuming perfect channel knowledge at both the transmit and receive sides, we consider the problem of selecting the transmit and receive RF beamformers that maximize the capacity (MaxCAP criterion) of the system under orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions. This problem is non-convex and has no closed-form solution, therefore the maximum capacity beamformers are found using a gradient search algorithm. Furthermore, it is shown in the paper that, for low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), the MaxCAP criterion is equivalent to maximizing the received SNR (MaxSNR criterion). However, for moderate and high SNRs, the maximum capacity beamformers sacrifice part of the received SNR in order to improve the worst subcarriers and, in this way, they increase the overall capacity of the multicarrier channel. Finally, by means of numerical examples we show that the MaxCAP criterion significantly outperforms the MaxSNR criterion in terms of bit error rate and outage probability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Antenna Combining for Maximum Capacity Under OFDM Transmissions","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198742","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198742.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analog Antenna Combining for Maximum Capacity Under OFDM Transmissions","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198742/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814886","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Antenna Combining for Maximum Capacity Under OFDM Transmissions","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-12-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073493S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5198743,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Compressive Sensing (CS) has recently been proposed to address this problem. Typical CS techniques, however, involve random projections followed by a computationally intensive signal reconstruction process. Since spectral monitoring does require full signal reconstruction - only identification of occupied regions to avoid - we propose a novel spectrum monitoring approach based on the Nyquist Folding Receiver (NYFR) in conjunction with the Analytic Wavelet Transform. The NYFR performs analog compression via a non-uniform sampling process that induces a chirp-like modulation on each received signal. This induced modulation can be measured using time-frequency analysis techniques to determine the original RF band of origin without full signal reconstruction. This paper investigates the feasibility of using the Analytic Wavelet Transform to perform NYFR information recovery in support of CR wideband spectrum sensing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198754.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Analytic Wavelet Transform for Signal Detection in Nyquist Folding Analog-to-Information Receiver","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Wavelet analysis","Wavelet transforms","Signal detection","Monitoring","Radio frequency","Signal reconstruction","Chromium","Wideband","Radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","receivers","signal detection","time-frequency analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytic wavelet transform","signal detection","Nyquist folding analog-to-information receiver","cognitive radio","wideband radio frequency","compressive sensing","chirp-like modulation","induced modulation","time-frequency analysis","wideband spectrum sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Application of Analytic Wavelet Transform for Signal Detection in Nyquist Folding Analog-to-Information Receiver","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198754/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815646","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Analytic Wavelet Transform for Signal Detection in Nyquist Folding Analog-to-Information Receiver","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-11-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055162S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5198755,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A simple signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression is derived that is independent from the spreading codes and explicitly accounts for the effects of the multiple-access interference (MAI) and the relay noise. The so-obtained SINR expression is then computed based entirely on the available local information. The results obtained above are then used to optimally design the cooperative system. In particular, it is shown how the amount of cooperation between each collaborating pair can be adjusted to simultaneously achieve a pre-assigned target SINR for both users. Based on the local information, the globally optimal amount of the relay power is also obtained that maximizes the achieved SINR at the access point.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198765","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Analysis and Design of Multiuser Cooperative DS-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Analysis and Design of Multiuser Cooperative DS-CDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198765/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815505","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Analysis and Design of Multiuser Cooperative DS-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-04-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061037S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198774,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We call our method back-of-the-envelop (BoE) computation, because for many network configurations, very accurate results can be obtained by simple hand computation. BoE beats prior methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. To explain BoE, we construct a theory based on the model of an \"ideal CSMA network\" (ICN). We find that link throughputs are insensitive to the distributions of the backoff countdown time and transmission time in ICN given the ratio of their mean c. The BoE computation method emerges from ICN in the limit c rarr 0 . The insensitivity result explains why BoE works so well for IEEE 802.11 networks, in which the backoff countdown process is one that has memory and the transmission time can be arbitrarily distributed. Furthermore, c does not have to be very small for BoE to be highly accurate. BoE allows us to make shortcuts in performance evaluation, bypassing complicated stochastic analysis. An immediate application of BoE is for quick identification of starved links in the network so that remedies can be devised to solve the problem.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198774.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198774","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198774","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198774","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer networks","Distributed computing","Throughput","Multiaccess communication","Wireless networks","Stochastic processes","Peer to peer computing","Communications Society","Performance analysis","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","IEEE standards","radio networks","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["back-of-the-envelope computation","throughput distributions","CSMA wireless networks","ideal CSMA network","backoff countdown time","transmission time","BoE computation method","IEEE 802.11 network","starved network link identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198774/","displayDocTitle":"Back-of-the-Envelope Computation of Throughput Distributions in CSMA Wireless Networks","accessionNumber":"10815163","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198774/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back-of-the-Envelope Computation of Throughput Distributions in CSMA Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-04-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053591S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5198776,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP), probability density function (PDF), moment generating function (MGF), and generalized moments of the end-to-end signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) are obtained. It is shown that when the same antenna configurations are considered at the source and destination sides, the power imbalance between the hops may be either beneficial or detrimental for the overall system performance. In addition, depending on whether the average SNR of the second hop is equal, lower, or higher than that of the first hop, an increase of the number of antennas may not necessarily result in a substantial improvement in performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198781.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming in Dual-Hop Fixed Gain Relaying Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Relays","Power system relaying","Closed-form solution","Performance gain","Peer to peer computing","Probability density function","Signal generators","System performance","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["beamforming","dual-hop fixed gain relaying systems","variable-gain relays","closed-form expressions","outage probability","probability density function","moment generating function","end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio","generalized moments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming in Dual-Hop Fixed Gain Relaying Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198781/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814767","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming in Dual-Hop Fixed Gain Relaying Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-05-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062613S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5198783,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The objective is to maximize data throughput while maintaining the synchronization between secondary users and avoiding interference with licensed (primary) users. No statistical information about the primary traffic is assumed to be available a-priori to the secondary user. We investigate two distinct sensing scenarios. In the first, the secondary transmitter is capable of sensing all the primary channels, whereas it senses one channel only in the second scenario. In both cases, we propose MAC protocols that efficiently learn the statistics of the primary traffic online. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed blind protocols asymptotically achieve the throughput obtained when prior knowledge of primary traffic statistics is available.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198790","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198790.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Cognitive MAC Protocols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198790/","displayDocTitle":"Blind Cognitive MAC Protocols","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815396","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198790/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Cognitive MAC Protocols","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-07-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047152S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198791,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm is used to estimate the channel spatial and temporal signatures and the multipath parameters are then extracted by means of MUSIC-like subspace algorithms, enabling us to recover the transmit and receive angles as well as the path propagation delays of the MIMO channel, without ambiguities.

Indeed, we have shown that the slope change, from positive to negative trend, of the signal space dimension curve is representative of the transition from a vacant band to an occupied band (and vice versa). In fact, the number of significant eigenvalues is determined by the value that minimizes the Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and is directly related to the presence/absance of data in the signal.

We consider a setting where users of spectrum are involved in peer-to-peer links with QoS requirements. Each wireless transmission (link) is priced collectively by all revenue seeking brokers whose responsibility areas are affected by the transmission (via interference). We propose a two-level coordination mechanism. At the pricing-level, the brokers affected by a given link collectively determine prices. At the admission level, all brokers potentially affected by all transmissions collectively determine the set of link requests that are to be permitted. The links are modeled as price sensitive users who may or may not form connections, based on the total price asked. Experimental results show that cooperation significantly increases both the number of active links and broker revenues. Relative gains achieved by pricing level cooperation alone or admission level cooperation alone depend on price sensitivity parameters for the links as well as the total number of link formation requests.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198797/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10814914","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198797/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Broker Coordination in Demand Responsive Dynamic Spectrum Access Settings","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broker Coordination in Demand Responsive Dynamic Spectrum Access Settings","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"08-07-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037255S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198800,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Since COs have limited storage capabilities, they may need to retrieve a particular video content that is requested by a user but temporary not stored in the local memory. Thus, COs exchange video contents with similar COs in a peer-to-peer fashion. At a higher hierarchical level, video source offices (VSOs) offer the video contents that cannot be retrieved at the CO level. Video content caching strategies at the COs and VSOs influence the system performance in terms of traffic exchanged between the network nodes. In this paper we propose two simple strategies that aim at reducing both the intra- and inter-level traffic. The strategies are studied by means of an analytical model that is validated against simulation results. Our results show that the hierarchical architecture allow good system performance even with limited overall storage capacity. The proposed strategies, in particular, can be helpful in improving system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10814661","htmlLink":"/document/5198800/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Caching Video Contents in IPTV Systems with Hierarchical Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching Video Contents in IPTV Systems with Hierarchical Architecture","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"03-07-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112967S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198803,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The estimator is derived based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization framework. The obtained solution iteratively updates both the desired user's and the interferer's channels, using a combination of linear minimum mean squared-error (LMMSE) filtering and interference cancellation, avoiding the complex matrix inversions involved in the full LMMSE channel estimation approach. Estimation of the noise variance is also included in the iterative algorithm, accounting for Gaussian noise and residual interference after each iteration. The estimates of both channels are used at the equalizer to reject the interfering signal, thus mitigating the degradation due to co-channel interference.

A new concept of channel estimation by performing the power allocation at the relay node is introduced. As an example, we consider the maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimation at relay node and derive the power allocation factor such that the average effective signal-to-noise ratio (AESNR) at the terminal nodes is maximized. Nonetheless, the idea of using power allocation at relay node can be straightforwardly extended to more general scenarios.

However, the MSSNR method tends to design a TEQ with a bandpass-like frequency response, resulting in a spectrally uneven effective channel response. As as result, bit-loading have to be performed to improve the bit rate of the system. Additionally, when residual intersymbol interference (ISI) is low compared to noise power, the spectral shape of the effective channel does not have much impact on the bit rate. However, the negative effect of the channel spectral unevenness on achievable bit rate increases as the noise power decreases. In this paper, a design method is proposed to maximize effective channel spectral flatness to increase the bit rate of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198821","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198821.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Spectral Flattening in Time Domain Equalizer Design for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Spectral Flattening in Time Domain Equalizer Design for OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198821/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814787","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198821/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Spectral Flattening in Time Domain Equalizer Design for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-09-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054748S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198824,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Two locations of the transmitter, Tx, on the human body are considered. The Lognormal distribution provides a good fitting model with and without movement. Further, the stability is characterized based on a measure of channel response variance, which is called here the channel variation factor and can characterize the channel coherence time. The on-body to off-body area channel is determined to be generally stable over a period of 25 ms, but the amount of stability is found to be dependent both on movement, Tx location on-body, and carrier frequency.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198824.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of the Dynamic Narrowband On-Body to Off-Body Area Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Narrowband","Time measurement","Stability","Area measurement","Frequency measurement","Legged locomotion","Transmitters","Humans","Biological system modeling","Coherence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body area networks","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband on body area channel","off body area channel","ISM band","statistical characterization","human body","frequency 900 MHz","frequency 2400 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of the Dynamic Narrowband On-Body to Off-Body Area Channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198824/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198824/","accessionNumber":"10814788","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of the Dynamic Narrowband On-Body to Off-Body Area Channel","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-37-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055584S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5198825,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In particular, we devise a powerful coded Q-PPM scheme which is a simplified version of MLC and which we refer to as reduced-level MLC (RL-MLC). We show how to design and optimize RL-MLC for Q-PPM when using constellation-constrained capacity as the pertinent figure of merit. Furthermore, we provide simulative evidence that RL- MLC with off-the-shelf low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) closely approaches its corresponding capacity limit. For 64-PPM, RL-MLC with only two levels achieves practically the same performance as that of bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID), which involves a more difficult design procedure.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198829","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198829.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded Pulse-Position Modulation for Free-Space Optical Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Coded Pulse-Position Modulation for Free-Space Optical Communications","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198829/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815412","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded Pulse-Position Modulation for Free-Space Optical Communications","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-18-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059972S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198831,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been shown to provide a high level performance for detecting anomalies in sequences of system calls to the operating system kernel. Although the number of hidden states is a critical parameter for HMM performance, it is often chosen heuristically or empirically, by selecting the single value that provides the best performance on training data. However, this single best HMM does not typically provide a high level of performance over the entire detection space. This paper presents a multiple-HMMs approach, where each HMM is trained using a different number of hidden states, and where HMM responses are combined in the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) space according to the maximum realizable ROC (MRROC) technique. The performance of this approach is compared favorably to that of a single best HMM and to a traditional sequence matching technique called STIDE, using different synthetic HIDS data sets. Results indicate that this approach provides a higher level of performance over a wide range of training set sizes with various alphabet sizes and irregularity indices, and different anomaly sizes, without a significant computational and storage overhead.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198832.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining Hidden Markov Models for Improved Anomaly Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198832/","displayDocTitle":"Combining Hidden Markov Models for Improved Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815524","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198832/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining Hidden Markov Models for Improved Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-15-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051666S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5198833,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In this paper, a kind of hardware based compact DFA structure for multiple regexes matching called CPDFA is presented. According to statistics of regexes in Snort and L7-filter rules, transitions from each state to its next states are not evenly distributed. The summation of transitions from each state to its top three most popular next states takes about 90% of all the transitions. Therefore, CPDFA employs an indirect index table to represent transitions to top three most popular next states more efficiently. The remaining transitions which take about 10% of all the transitions are stored in direct transition table or K parallel SRAMs according to the number of remaining transitions from the same state is more than K or not. Simulation shows that CPDFA structure can save about 90% of memory storage comparing with the original DFA structure. By using pipelined architecture in FPGA, CPDFA can advance one character in one memory access cycle.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact DFA Structure for Multiple Regular Expressions Matching","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198833","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198833.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Compact DFA Structure for Multiple Regular Expressions Matching","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198833/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814791","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact DFA Structure for Multiple Regular Expressions Matching","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-13-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050814S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198835,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However, the generalized multi-carrier (GMC) system reflects different interference characters in the presence of CFO. In this paper, we exactly analyze the CFO effect on GMC, which multiplexes several single band single carrier based frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) streams in frequency domain, under the scenario of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. A closed-form expression of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is derived for the GMC systems in the presence of CFO. Furthermore, the bit error rate (BER) performance analysis is also performed in comparison with the traditional OFDM system for both uncoded and coded environments. Analysis and simulation results show that the feature procedure of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) spread may condense the CFO-induced interference in the first symbol of each subband, resulting in less interference in other symbols. Such condensing procedure can provide robustness against the CFO effect, which also lies on the subband bandwidth for GMC systems. In contrast to the conventional OFDM system, GMC exhibits more robustness when each subband width is designed for 4 times larger than the subcarrier spacing.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198835","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198835.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Effects of Carrier Frequency Offset on Generalized Multi-Carrier and OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198835","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198835/","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Effects of Carrier Frequency Offset on Generalized Multi-Carrier and OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815066","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198835/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Effects of Carrier Frequency Offset on Generalized Multi-Carrier and OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-34-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054634S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5198836,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The objective is to evaluate the throughput and error performance of different analog and digital relay schemes with linear network coding at the relay. The analog relay node forwards either a scaled version of the received signal to the destinations, or alternatively, first filters the received signals to generate a linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) estimate, which is subsequently forwarded. The digital relay scheme first detects the source transmissions, combines the packets with a network code, and forwards the resulting symbols to the destinations. For all schemes the destinations recover the source and relay signals by first applying linear MMSE filters, followed by decoding of the source bits. The performance of the schemes are compared in terms of normalized throughput (bits per channel use accounting for the delay due to the relay) and uncoded error probability, given a normalized power constraint. Both narrowband and wideband transmission schemes are considered. Our results show that the analog relay schemes outperform the digital network coding scheme with respect to both throughput and error probability because of error propagation through the relay. Numerical results are presented, which illustrate throughput-reliability trade-offs for all schemes considered.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital relays","Network coding","Throughput","Nonlinear filters","Error probability","Signal generators","Decoding","Delay","Narrowband","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","error statistics","filtering theory","least mean squares methods","multicast communication","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog relay methods","digital relay methods","wireless multicasting","half-duplex relay","error performance","minimum mean squared error","linear MMSE filters","uncoded error probability","normalized power constraint","narrowband transmission","wideband transmission","digital network coding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198836","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198836.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Analog and Digital Relay Methods with Network Coding for Wireless Multicast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Analog and Digital Relay Methods with Network Coding for Wireless Multicast","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198836/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198836/","accessionNumber":"10814927","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Analog and Digital Relay Methods with Network Coding for Wireless Multicast","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-06-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124281S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5198839,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Realizations like the list sphere detector (LSD) or the single tree search (STS) enable near max-log detection at reduced but still high complexity. In this paper we show how the complexity of list sphere detection can be significantly reduced by MMSE preprocessing in combination with a novel unbiased and separated candidate handling. Therefor, we propose an extension of the LSD by search tuples. Without any performance loss, the resulting tuple search (TS) algorithm enables major reduction of sphere sizes and enables moreover a detection with flexible performance respectively complexity. Avoiding loss of useful status information, caused by unbiased MMSE preprocessing or small candidate storage, is provided by a novel matched candidate determination, leading also to reduced hardware complexity. The combination of these methods enable high- performance soft-out detection at very low complexity. More specifically, this enables a performance improvement up to 1 dB at half the complexity of common LSD or STS algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198839","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198839.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity Reduced Soft-In Soft-Out Sphere Detection Based on Search Tuples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198839/","displayDocTitle":"Complexity Reduced Soft-In Soft-Out Sphere Detection Based on Search Tuples","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814932","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198839/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity Reduced Soft-In Soft-Out Sphere Detection Based on Search Tuples","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-11-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055238S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198841,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We derive the optimal likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic based on the Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion at the fusion center for both hard (one-bit) and quantized (multi-bit) local decisions. We show that the LRT statistic depends on the modulation type and second- and fourth- order statistics of the primary signal. However, such side information is not commonly available to the secondary network. Therefore, we propose to apply composite hypothesis testing methods, such as the Rao test, which do not require any prior knowledge about the primary signal, in a cooperative sensing scenario. We derive a modified Rao test statistic for decision making at the fusion center for both cases of hard and quantized local decisions. We also apply the locally most powerful (LMP) detector at the fusion center for weak primary signals and derive its corresponding test statistic. These methods are much simpler than the optimal NP-based method and do not require estimation of the primary signal statistics while having a very close performance to the optimal method.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198841","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198841.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198841","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Composite Hypothesis Testing for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Composite Hypothesis Testing for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198841/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198841/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814671","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite Hypothesis Testing for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-07-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051737S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5198842,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Exploiting the rich multipath diversity with channel estimating Rake receivers enables significant energy capture, higher performance and flexibility than suboptimal receivers. Although data-aided (DA) maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimator shows a promising performance, its implementation is restricted by the Nyquist sampling criterion. The emerging theory of compressed sensing (CS) describes a novel framework to jointly compress and detect a sparse signal with fewer samples than the traditional Nyquist criterion. In this paper, we propose a CS-ML channel estimator which combines the compression framework of CS for sampling rate reduction while retaining the noise statistics formulation of ML to achieve a reliable performance. Simulation assessment indicates that, with far fewer measurements, the performance of our proposed scheme supersedes that of the 4-norm minimization estimator of CS and can be as close as the ML, but with a reduction in complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198842","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198842.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed Sensing Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation for Ultra-Wideband Impulse Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198842/","displayDocTitle":"Compressed Sensing Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation for Ultra-Wideband Impulse Radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815526","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198842/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed Sensing Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation for Ultra-Wideband Impulse Radio","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-16-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049985S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198846,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In this paper, we present a two step approach to video quality prediction. First, video sequences are classified into groups representing different content types using cluster analysis. The classification of contents is based on the temporal (movement) and spatial (edges, brightness) feature extraction. Second, based on the content type, video quality (in terms of Mean Opinion Score) is predicted from network level parameter (packet error rate) and application level (i.e. send bitrate, frame rate) parameters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The performance of the developed model is evaluated with unseen datasets and good prediction accuracy is obtained for all content types.

A comprehensive system level simulation model has been used with a facility to trace a particular test user during its motion from eNodeB towards the cell border and back to its initial position. This study demonstrates the effect of distance path-loss of a test user on several physical layer performance metrics including throughput, resource allocation as well as modulation and coding scheme utilization. Simulation results in a fully loaded network show high throughput for open-loop fractional power control for the user located in the vicinity of the serving eNodeB, however, steep performance degradation has been observed when the user is moving towards the cell edge. The user throughput at the cell border can be increased by the closed-loop component.

Whereas for FD-BF the BF weights are applied in the FD, for TD-BF cyclic BF filters (C-BFFs) are used on the TD signal avoiding discrete- time Fourier transform operations at the relays and drastically reducing the required amount of feedback from the receiver to the relays. Adopting the average mutual information (AMI) per sub-carrier as optimality criterion, we show that the direction of the optimal FD-BF weights can be obtained in closed-form and that the optimal sub-carrier power allocation (PA) problem is convex. For solution of the PA problem an interior point method and a bisectional search dual method are provide. Furthermore, for solution of the C-BFF optimization problem an efficient gradient algorithm is proposed.

In this paper, we propose a nonlinear multi-user MIMO cooperative downlink transmission scheme. The algorithm eliminates the interference and achieves symbol error rate (SER) fairness among different users. To eliminate the interference, Tomlinson Harashima precoding (THP) is used to cancel part of the interference while the transmit-receive antenna weights cancel the remaining part. The uplink-downlink duality principle is used to calculate transmit-receive antenna weights. The proposed scheme is then extended to work when the receiver does not have complete Channel State Informations (CSIs).

Recently proposed cooperative spectrum sensing methods do not consider errors occurring during the transmission of local cognitive radio decisions to the cognitive base station. However, perfect communication is clearly not the case in realistic cooperative spectrum sensing scenarios and might lead to misleading performance result interpretations. In this paper, we extend the simple cooperative spectrum sensing communication model to admit transmission imperfections. Specifically, we consider the case where the local hard cognitive radio decisions that are based on any local detection scheme are corrupted by additive noise during transmission from cognitive radios to cognitive base station. Utilizing this extended cooperative spectrum sensing model, we present the complex optimal and a practical and effective suboptimal detector that is capable of operating with any local cognitive radio detection scheme: Two-step detector. We present simulation results investigating the performance of the proposed detectors and the effect of parameters of interest such as number of cognitive radios and signal to noise ratio. Moreover, we provide comparisons between non-cooperative and cooperative spectrum sensing performances revealing some cases where non-cooperative scheme is more effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198863/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10815534","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198863/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Noisy Hard Decision Transmissions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Spectrum Sensing with Noisy Hard Decision Transmissions","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"08-05-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084035S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5198866,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is well known in the literature that a simple-yet very effective-way to improve the performance of suboptimal iterative decoders is based on applying a scaling factor to the L-values. In this paper, starting with a theoretical model based on the so-called consistency condition of a random variable, we propose a methodology for correcting the L-values that relies only on the distribution of the soft information exchanged in the iterative process. This methodology gives a clear explanation of why the well-known linear scaling factor provides a very good performance. Additionally, the proposed methodology allows us to avoid the exhaustive search required otherwise. Numerical simulations show that for turbo codes the scaling factors found closely follow the optimum values, which translates to a close-to-optimal BER performance. Moreover, for LDPC codes, the proposed methodology produces a better BER performance compared with the known method in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correcting Suboptimal Metrics in Iterative Decoders","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198866","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198866.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Correcting Suboptimal Metrics in Iterative Decoders","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198866/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815074","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correcting Suboptimal Metrics in Iterative Decoders","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-13-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101067S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5198870,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, such artificial signatures incur signaling overhead and come at the bandwidth cost. In this paper, we show intrinsic cyclostationary signatures in the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system with Cyclic Delay Diversity (CDD). The standard conformable CDD technique is initially motivated by the objective for exploiting spatial diversity. Significantly, the underlying periodicity of CDD can simultaneously induce advantageous cyclostationary signatures without any signaling overhead. The lag-indices of the CDD- induced signatures are uniquely determined by the assigned amount of cyclic delay. Consequently each CDD-OFDM system can be identified by a pre-assigned cyclic delay. The signed system can be easily and robustly recognized through cyclostationary detection. Furthermore, the CDD-OFDM systems still preserve the cyclic-prefix induced cyclostationarity as primitive OFDM. By exploiting the overall cyclostationarity, we present a desirable cyclostationarity detector with asymptotical constant false alarm rate for spectrum sensing. Comprehensive simulations are also given to show the performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198879","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198879.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclostationary Signatures in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radios with Cyclic Delay Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198879/","displayDocTitle":"Cyclostationary Signatures in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radios with Cyclic Delay Diversity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815434","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198879/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclostationary Signatures in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radios with Cyclic Delay Diversity","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-10-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092165S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198880,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The lower bound on the DOF is obtained by showing that the zero-forcing solution suffices to achieve all the DOF. Also, the upper bound which coincides with the lower bound is shown using Jafar's earlier work. From the derived result, we observe that disabling receive cooperation of the MIMO interference channel causes the DOF loss. Additionally, we propose a linear precoding scheme for the IFBC by extending one designed for broadcast channels with an aim of maximizing the sum rate performance. We utilize the fact that the precoding matrices in stationary point always satisfy the zero-gradient condition. Our result is confirmed through numerical simulations on the sum rate performance of the proposed precoding technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198887.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom and Sum Rate Maximization for Two Mutually Interfering Broadcast Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadcasting","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Upper bound","Interference channels","Downlink","Base stations","Information technology","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel coding","MIMO communication","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degrees of freedom","DOF","interfering broadcast channels","MIMO interference channel","linear precoding","IFBC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom and Sum Rate Maximization for Two Mutually Interfering Broadcast Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198887/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814688","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom and Sum Rate Maximization for Two Mutually Interfering Broadcast Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-05-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077052S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198888,"authors":[{"name":"S.-H.

For example, once the transmission from a base station with multiple antennas is received by multiple nodes (relays and/or mobiles), they can exchange information to enhance the quality of intended signals while suppressing interference. Such virtual multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission is a key ingredient in hierarchical cooperation by Ozgiir et al., which was shown to improve the throughput scaling of ad hoc networks greatly. In this paper, we analyze the achievable rate of such a cooperative MIMO between a base station with multiple antennas and a node group. An antenna array with a fixed area has a limited number of degrees of freedom. We use a realistic channel model that can capture the effect of geometry of antenna arrays on the number of degrees of freedom. Our achievable rate is limited by the product of the aperture of the antenna array in the base station and the angular spread, which is consistent with some known results on the limit of the degrees of antenna arrays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of Cooperative MIMO in Cellular Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198888","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom of Cooperative MIMO in Cellular Networks","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198888/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815316","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom of Cooperative MIMO in Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-08-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0888S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198893,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This characterization method finds the optimal set of code rates for the MLC scheme for a set of required SNR operation points. On the other hand, fixing the code rates to find out the operation points of SNR is also possible. Performance of common mapping strategies used in MLC schemes, as block labeling and Ungerbock labeling, are evaluated using MSD charts.

A new retransmission structure with a sequence of multiple codebooks is proposed that are optimized for combining gain, rather than using a single identical codebook for every retransmission. Furthermore, a criterion for selecting a pre-coding matrix for each retransmission can be provided so as to minimize the retransmission error probability. Under the proposed multiple codebook structure for MIMO-HARQ systems, a sequence of optimum codebooks is constructed for the subsequent retransmissions. Simulation results are presented for showing that the proposed scheme achieves significant error performance advantages over conventional schemes with a single codebook and furthermore, a near-optimal performance is achieved as the codebook size chosen is large enough.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198901","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198901.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198901","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Codebook Structure for a Progressively Linear Pre-Coded Closed-Loop MIMO Hybrid ARQ System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Codebook Structure for a Progressively Linear Pre-Coded Closed-Loop MIMO Hybrid ARQ System","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198901/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814697","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198901/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Codebook Structure for a Progressively Linear Pre-Coded Closed-Loop MIMO Hybrid ARQ System","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-41-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066991S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198904,"authors":[{"name":"C.-H.

By relaxing the cross-correlation functions to at most two, the new 2D codes can provide larger code cardinality to accommodate more subscribers. They also have better performance than 1D optical codes because they can support heavier code weight, for a given code length. Moreover, our numerical examples show that the heavier code weight supported by our new 2D codes results in better performance than some of our previously proposed 2D codes, which have the maximum cross- correlation value of one.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198904.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Two-Dimensional Wavelength-Time Codes for Fiber-Optic CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Autocorrelation","Communications Society","Optical fiber communication","Performance analysis","Galois fields","Synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","orthogonal codes","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-dimensional wavelength-time code","fiber-optic CDMA system","one-dimensional optical orthogonal code","maximum cross-correlation value","time spreading code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of Two-Dimensional Wavelength-Time Codes for Fiber-Optic CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198904/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815097","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Two-Dimensional Wavelength-Time Codes for Fiber-Optic CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-16-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080569S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198909,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The key of cognitive radio operation is the ability to detect weak primary signals and to control the transmission of cognitive users in a way that interference between the two systems is minimized. In this paper we evaluate how a sensor network deployed to provide distributed spectrum sensing can assist cognitive operation. Specifically, we consider sensor networks with regular topology, where a high level of cooperation also means that sensors far from the source of the primary signal are involved in the sensing process. Assuming energy detection and hard-decision combining we derive worst case probabilities of missed detection and false alarm, determine the necessary level of cooperation among the sensors and evaluate how the sensor density and the sensing time affect the performance of distributed sensing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198909/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10814963","htmlLink":"/document/5198909/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Low-Power Primary Signals via Distributed Sensing to Support Opportunistic Spectrum Access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Low-Power Primary Signals via Distributed Sensing to Support Opportunistic Spectrum Access","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"08-08-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067484S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":5198911,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

This paper examines the use of unitary differential space-time frequency codes (DSTFCs) in MB-OFDM UWB, which increases the system bandwidth efficiency due to the fact that no CSI is required for differential detection. The proposed DSTFC MB-OFDM system would be useful when the transmission of multiple channel estimation symbols is impractical or uneconomical. Simulation results show that the application of DSTFCs associated with dual carrier modulation (DCM) can significantly improve the bit error performance of conventional differential MB-OFDM system (without MIMO), and even provide better bit error performance than the DSTFC MB-OFDM system associated with constant envelope modulation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198916","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198916.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Space-Time-Frequency Codes for MB-OFDM UWB with Dual Carrier Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Differential Space-Time-Frequency Codes for MB-OFDM UWB with Dual Carrier Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198916/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815561","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198916/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Space-Time-Frequency Codes for MB-OFDM UWB with Dual Carrier Modulation","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-32-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065576S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198921,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We investigate the problem of designing beam- formers for the secondary users by maximizing the minimum rate, subject to a limited sum-power budget and constraints on the interference level imposed on each primary receiver. We consider two scenarios: the first one allows only single-user decoding at each secondary receiver whereas in the second case each secondary receiver is allowed to employ advanced multiuser decoding and is free to decode any subset of secondary users. We provide an optimal distributed algorithm for the first scenario and an explicit formulation of the optimization problem corresponding to the second scenario. This problem however is non-convex and hence cannot be efficiently solved even in a centralized setup. As a remedy, we suggest a two-step approach. In particular, the beamformers are first designed assuming single user decoding at each secondary receiver. An optimal distributed low-complexity algorithm is then proposed to allocate excess rates to the secondary users, which are made possible due to the use of advanced decoders at the secondary receivers. Simulation results demonstrate the gains yielded by the optimal beamformers as well as the rate allocation algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198921.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Beamforming and Rate Allocation in Multi-Antenna Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198921/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Beamforming and Rate Allocation in Multi-Antenna Cognitive Radio Networks","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815327","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Beamforming and Rate Allocation in Multi-Antenna Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-07-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054302S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5198922,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Our objective is to maximize the sum rate with linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) receivers, treating the interference as additive Gaussian noise. An iterative approach is considered in which given a set of preceding matrices and powers, each receiver announces an interference price (marginal decrease in rate due to an increase in interference) for each received beam, corresponding to a column of the precoding matrix. Given the interference prices from the neighboring receiver, and also knowledge of the appropriate cross-channel matrices, the transmitter can then update the beams and powers to maximize the rate minus the interference cost. Variations on this approach are presented in which beams are added sequentially (and then fixed), and in which all beams and associated powers are adjusted at each iteration. Numerical results are presented, which compare these algorithms with iterative water-filling (which requires no information exchange), and a centralized optimization algorithm, which finds locally optimal solutions. Our results show that the distributed algorithms perform close to the centralized algorithm, and by adapting the rank of the precoder matrices, achieve the optimal high-SNR slope.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Interference Pricing for the MIMO Interference Channel","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198927","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198927.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Interference Pricing for the MIMO Interference Channel","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198927/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815329","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Interference Pricing for the MIMO Interference Channel","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-10-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067024S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5198936,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

From our analysis, it is seen that of the paths from one terminal to relays and from relays to another terminal, those with smaller diversity order result in an overall system performance bottleneck.

The source broadcasts code-bits to relay and destination during the relay-receive phases, the relay decodes and transmits additional code-bits to the destination during the relay-transmit phases. We propose to use the timing of the relay-receive and relay-transmit phases to transfer more additional code-bits to the destination at the cost of stricter synchronization requirements. Moreover, it is required that the relay is able to switch its state rapidly between receiving and transmitting from symbol to symbol. The destination does not know the timing of the relay-receive and relay-transmit phases a priori and has to distinguish the transmissions of source and relay due to the received amplitude. The received amplitude at the destination is higher for transmissions of the relay because the relay-destination link is stronger than the source-destination link. A constant- weight code is used to determine the timing of the relay-receive and relay-transmit phases. Simulation results for an example show a substantial gain of the proposed extension.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198937","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198937.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Turbo Coding with Information Transfer via Timing of the Half-Duplex Relay-Phases","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Turbo Coding with Information Transfer via Timing of the Half-Duplex Relay-Phases","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198937/","accessionNumber":"10815210","publicationDate":"June 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Turbo Coding with Information Transfer via Timing of the Half-Duplex Relay-Phases","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-24-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062466S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198938,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The DTTCM scheme is designed based on its decoding convergence with the aid of non-binary extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. The source node transmits TTCM symbols to both the relay and the destination nodes during the first transmission period. The relay performs TTCM decoding and re-encodes the information bits using a recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) code regardless whether the relay can decode correctly or not. Only the parity bits are transmitted from the relay node to the destination node during the second transmission period. The resultant symbols transmitted from the source and relay nodes can be viewed as the coded symbols of a three-component parallel-concatenated TTCM scheme. At the destination node, a novel three-component TTCM decoding is performed. It is shown that the performance of the DTTCM matches exactly the EXIT chart analysis. It also performs very closely to its idealised counterpart that assumes perfect decoding at the relay.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198938","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198938.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Turbo Trellis Coded Modulation for Cooperative Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198938/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Turbo Trellis Coded Modulation for Cooperative Communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814718","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198938/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Turbo Trellis Coded Modulation for Cooperative Communications","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-11-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054434S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198939,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In order to mitigate such co-channel interference cooperating Base Stations (BSs) can perform joint multi-antenna signal processing across cell borders. This paper describes a concept of distributed cooperation, where BSs communicate directly via a BS-BS interface without central control. A serving BS can serve its terminals on its own or it can request cooperation from one or more supporting BSs. By collecting IQ samples from the supporting BSs' antenna elements, the serving BS can virtually increase its number of receive antennas. Exchanging additional parameters allows applying advanced receiver algorithms, e.g., interference rejection or cancelation. Performance evaluations by means of simulation show the capability of BS cooperation applied to 3GPP LTE in terms of cell and user throughput but it also shows the tradeoff in terms of increased backhaul requirement due to BS-BS communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Uplink Signal Processing of Cooperating Base Stations Based on IQ Sample Exchange","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198939","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198939.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Uplink Signal Processing of Cooperating Base Stations Based on IQ Sample Exchange","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198939/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815211","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Uplink Signal Processing of Cooperating Base Stations Based on IQ Sample Exchange","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-28-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036661S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198941,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An optimization problem is first formulated for distributing the transmission power of the BS and the RSs. The objective is to minimize the transmission power of the BS and the total transmission power of the RSs, subject to the average transmission rate and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement of the user traffic. The optimum power distribution requires link gains among different MSs, which are usually not available at the BS. We then propose a practical power distribution scheme based on link gains of the RS and DS to the BS. Our results show that i) the proposed link-gain based power distribution scheme achieves close-to-optimum performance, ii) by appropriately selecting the RS and forwarding techniques, cooperative relaying in the downlink of a CDMA network can reduce the communication outage probability and significantly save the BS transmission power in the downlink transmissions, and iii) cooperatively relaying requires very low transmission power from the RSs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Power Distribution in a Wireless CDMA Network with Cooperative Relaying","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198946","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198946.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198946/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Power Distribution in a Wireless CDMA Network with Cooperative Relaying","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198946/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815573","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Power Distribution in a Wireless CDMA Network with Cooperative Relaying","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-02-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0542S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198947,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, QoS guarantee requirements are seldom taken into account. In this paper, we propose a downlink scheduling algorithm for QoS-guaranteed services in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with limited feedback. The proposed algorithm combines stream selection with multi-user packet scheduling. To maximize the overall capacity and reduce co-channel interference, streams are selected in accordance with preceding matrices. In multi-user packet scheduling, the base station first determines the SDMA region size for the primary streams. In addition, packet scheduling for the secondary streams is performed to completely exploit spatial multiplexing gains. Numerical results show that, at the cost of slightly lower system fairness, the proposed algorithm can achieve higher spectrum efficiency, and have a noticeable improvement in guaranteeing QoS requirements in terms of data rates and delay.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198948","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198948.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Scheduling for QoS-Guaranteed Services in Multi-User MIMO Systems with Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Scheduling for QoS-Guaranteed Services in Multi-User MIMO Systems with Limited Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198948/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815590","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198948/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Scheduling for QoS-Guaranteed Services in Multi-User MIMO Systems with Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-09-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053435S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198951,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We propose a new dynamic channel feedback control (DEFCON) scheme, which efficiently allocates the limited system resources for channel feedback to appropriate users. The main features of the proposed DEFCON scheme are as follows. Firstly, the channel feedback procedure is composed of two stages: rough channel feedback of all users and additional precise channel feedback of the selected users only. Secondly, each selected user is allocated with different amount of resources for additional channel feedback according to its channel status. We mathematically solve the resource allocation problem by proposing a suboptimal method, which utilizes convex optimization technique combined with iterative steepest decent direction search algorithm. Numerical results show that zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) with the proposed DEFCON scheme considerably outperforms previous limited-feedback MU-MIMO schemes such as ZFBF with conventional static feedback method and per user unitary beamforming rate control (PU\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nRC).","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198953.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Channel Feedback Control for Limited-Feedback Multi-User MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback control","MIMO","Array signal processing","Resource management","Output feedback","Radio control","Base stations","Receiving antennas","Communications Society","Paper technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","optimisation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO systems","dynamic channel feedback control","limited feedback","DEFCON scheme","rough channel feedback","precise channel feedback","channel status","resource allocation","convex optimization","zero forcing beamforming","static feedback method","per user unitary beamforming rate control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Channel Feedback Control for Limited-Feedback Multi-User MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198953/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815592","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Channel Feedback Control for Limited-Feedback Multi-User MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-21-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07825S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5198955,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In this dynamic scheme, each relay in the system chooses, packet by packet, between DF and AF dynamically and independently by examining the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) result of the packet. The relays encode the mixed DF/AF signals into a distributed linear dispersion code (DLDC), and then transmit the coded signals to the destination. We show that our proposed dynamic DF/AF scheme outperforms the DF and AF schemes over a wide signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range. We also propose a more general and flexible form of DLDC, which treats the source-relay link and relay-destination link separately and allows their packet durations to be different. In particular, we assume that the destination has multiple antennas and uses a general two-stage linear MMSE receiver to detect the possibly mixed DF/AF signals, without knowing the forwarding types adopted at the relays. A channel estimator is embedded in the receiver to estimate the source-relay link channel state information (CSI). With this receiver, only partial CSI (the CSI of the combined source-relay and relay-destination link) is required at the destination. The simulation results show that the degradation due to this two-stage receiver is minimal when compared to the optimal, but more complex, ML receiver with full CSI and knowledge of relay forwarding types.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198955.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Decode-And-Forward and Amplify-And-Forward Cooperative Strategy Using Distributed Space-Time Code in Uplink MIMO Systems with Multiple Relays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Space time codes","MIMO","Relays","Cyclic redundancy check","State estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Channel state information","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","relays","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed space-time code","uplink MIMO systems","multiple relays","amplify-and-forward cooperative strategy","distributed linear dispersion code","signal-to-noise ratio","source-relay link","relay-destination link","channel state information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Decode-And-Forward and Amplify-And-Forward Cooperative Strategy Using Distributed Space-Time Code in Uplink MIMO Systems with Multiple Relays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198955/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815217","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Decode-And-Forward and Amplify-And-Forward Cooperative Strategy Using Distributed Space-Time Code in Uplink MIMO Systems with Multiple Relays","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-39-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078011S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5198960,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Since it is difficult to obtain the optimal solution to the joint optimization problem, the whole procedure is divided into two steps, namely, the subcarrier-user scheduling and the resource allocation. In the first step, a new metric is proposed to measure the spatial compatibility of multiple users each with multiple receive antennas, based on which a new subcarrier-user scheduling algorithm is designed. In the second step, two dynamic resource allocation algorithms are developed to assign radio resources to the scheduled users accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in terms of the system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198960","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198960.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for Downlink Multi-User MIMO-OFDMA/SDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for Downlink Multi-User MIMO-OFDMA/SDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198960/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815218","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198960/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for Downlink Multi-User MIMO-OFDMA/SDMA Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-11-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07265S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198961,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The amount of the feedback information required from the relay to the source in the proposed scheme is independent of the number of subchannels, which results in a dramatic reduced overhead over conventional resource allocation schemes. Furthermore, the transmission durations at the source and the relay are designed to be asymmetric, which enhances the degree of freedom for transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation scheme achieves a higher system capacity, and has less sensitivity to channel estimation errors than the previously proposed schemes based on subchannel paring and power allocation. It also has a fast convergence speed. An intensive performance analysis is provided for the proposed resource allocation scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation with Limited Feedback for OFDM Based Cooperative Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198961","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198961.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation with Limited Feedback for OFDM Based Cooperative Networks","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198961/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814854","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Allocation with Limited Feedback for OFDM Based Cooperative Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-20-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078819S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5198963,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Therefore, we consider the maximization of the effective capacity in a single-user multi-antenna system with covariance knowledge. The optimal transmit strategy is derived and the properties as a function of the decay-rate requirement of the buffer occupancy are analyzed.

A recently proposed linear preceding technique, regularized block diagonalization (RBD), is used to mitigate multi-user interference. We assume that each receiver has estimated channel state information (CSI) via downlink training and independently quantizes its channel by using an efficient channel quantization scheme that we propose in this paper. The transmitter acquires the quantized CSI from each receiver through a noiseless and delayed feedback channel. The achievable rates are studied under these assumptions. We derive an upper bound for the rate loss compared to the case that the transmitter has perfect CSI and quantify the impact of channel estimation errors, quantization errors, and outdated quantized CSI on the rate loss. Furthermore, we provide an expression of the number of feedback bits needed per user to maitain that bound. It is found that the delay of the feedback is the predominant cause of performance degradation in the case of rapidly changing channel impulse response.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198965","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Imperfect Channel State Information on Achievable Rates of Precoded Multi-User MIMO Broadcast Channels with Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Imperfect Channel State Information on Achievable Rates of Precoded Multi-User MIMO Broadcast Channels with Limited Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198965/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814726","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198965/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Imperfect Channel State Information on Achievable Rates of Precoded Multi-User MIMO Broadcast Channels with Limited Feedback","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-10-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039891S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5198971,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In particular, the STC matrix A achieves full diversity by employing the Alomuti coding, while the STC matrix B achieves full rate by employing spatial multiplexing and the STC matrix C achieves full rate and diversity by employing the Golden code. In this paper, we present a FPGA architecture of MIMO decoder based on the fixed sphere decoder (FSD) algorithm that achieves close- to ML BER performance with a reduced computational complexity and fixed throughput. We show how a single FSD can be used to decode the different STC by adaptively processing the received signal according to the STC type prior to be fed to the FSD. The FPGA design is incorporated with a QR decomposition of the channel matrix. The proposed FSD achieves fixed and high throughput required for the WiMAX systems.

Our work is motivated by the precoding scheme developed by Sadek, Tarighat, and Sayed that maximizes the signal to leakage and noise ratio (SLNR), in which the precoding weight is obtained by the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD). However, the covariance matrix utilized in GEVD becomes close to be singular as the signal to noise ratio goes high. To improve the numerical accuracy, a GSVD based algorithm is exploited in this paper and a novel method is derived to compute the precoding weights for multiple users by removing redundant computational loads rather than repeating the GSVD algorithm for each user. In addition, we propose a technique to speed up the GSVD based precoding algorithm by preprocessing using the QR decomposition. Finally, to improve the system performance, the antenna selection scheme using GSVD is also proposed which does not require the exhaustive search to choose the active antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198973","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198973.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient GSVD Based Multi-User MIMO Linear Precoding and Antenna Selection Scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient GSVD Based Multi-User MIMO Linear Precoding and Antenna Selection Scheme","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198973/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815601","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5198973/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient GSVD Based Multi-User MIMO Linear Precoding and Antenna Selection Scheme","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-07-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049081S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5198975,"authors":[{"name":"V.

However, in a wireless network with cognitive radios, when a licensed user becomes active on a channel in a certain area, nodes and links that were using that channel must release it, which will cause traffic failures. Simple and effective recovery schemes are needed to re-allocate available resources for the failed traffic. In this paper, we study the failure recovery in wireless mesh networks with cognitive radios. We formally formulate the corresponding problems as integer linear programming problems. By solving them, we can obtain optimal solutions. Moreover, an efficient distributed heuristic algorithm is presented for fast recovery. Simulation results show that the performance given by our distributed algorithm is close to that of the optimal solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198977/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10814733","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198977/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Recovery Algorithms for Wireless Mesh Networks with Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Recovery Algorithms for Wireless Mesh Networks with Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-01-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064605S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198979,"authors":[{"name":"D.-M.

However, this vision is still far from reality due to limitations of current analog to digital converter performance. In this paper, a novel number system called the Folding Number System (FNS) is proposed for use in Software Radio. We implement sample rate conversion immediately after the receive antenna using this number system thus providing an efficient solution to the above problem. By decomposing the input analog signal into separate channels in parallel, symmetrical residues are obtained with reduced number of comparators. These residues together with the folding information are processed in parallel in the FNS domain. The FNS has the same computational complexity as that in Residue Number System but the need for the intermediate steps such conversion of the analog data into binary and subsequently into residues is absent.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software radio","Finite impulse response filter","Receiving antennas","Digital signal processing","Analog-digital conversion","Receivers","Clocks","Computational complexity","Signal processing","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","receiving antennas","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample rate conversion","software radio","folding number system","receive antenna","discrete time domain","analog to digital converter","computational complexity","residue number system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198979","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198979.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Sample Rate Conversion in Software Radio Employing Folding Number System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198979","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Sample Rate Conversion in Software Radio Employing Folding Number System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198979/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198979/","accessionNumber":"10815468","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Sample Rate Conversion in Software Radio Employing Folding Number System","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-14-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047902S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5198982,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Exploiting the additional degrees of freedom in the spatial dimension, multiple laser transmitters combined with multiple receiver apertures provide an effective solution for fading mitigation. Although MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) OW systems have been extensively studied in recent years, most of these works are mainly limited to symbol-by-symbol decoding. Maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) exploits the temporal correlation of turbulence-induced fading and promises further performance gains. In this paper, we investigate MLSD for IM/DD (intensity-modulation/direct-detection) MIMO OW systems over log-normal atmospheric turbulence channels. Even with a low-order modulation scheme such as on-off keying which is typically used in OW systems, the complexity of MLSD might be prohibitive. We therefore present an iterative sequence detector based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is much smaller than a direct evaluation of the log-likelihood function. The Monte-Carlo simulation results demonstrate that the EM-based algorithm outperforms the symbol-by-symbol decoder and achieves a performance which lies within 0.5 dB of that of the optimal MLSD.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198982","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198982.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EM-Based Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Detection for MIMO Optical Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198982/","displayDocTitle":"EM-Based Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Detection for MIMO Optical Wireless Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814734","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198982/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EM-Based Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Detection for MIMO Optical Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"07-08-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093823S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5198994,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we propose an energy saving MAC protocol in MIMO (ESMACM) systems by focusing on energy efficiency instead of capacity maximization. ESMACM considers the energy consumption together with the tradeoff between reliability (i.e., diversity) and throughput (i.e., multiplexing gain), and dynamically chooses an appropriate number of antennas for transmission. In computing the total energy consumption, ESMACM counts circuit energy as well as transmission energy. Naturally the circuit energy consumption is directly proportional to the number of active antennas. Through numerical analysis, we confirm that our ESMACM considerably saves energy consumption compared to conventional capacity maximization schemes that use a fixed number of MIMO channels, for a given outage constraint. Our finding is that the capacity maximizing communication which possibly can be regarded best in terms of energy efficiency gives a different solution from the energy minimizing communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Saving MAC for MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198994","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198994.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Energy Saving MAC for MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198994/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815232","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Saving MAC for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-23-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065458S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5198996,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Most existing security mechanisms focus on traditional cryptographic schemes. In recent years, features of the multi-path channel (such as randomness and reciprocity), have driven researchers to exploit its potential to enhance the security of wireless networks. As OFDM occupies wide bandwidth, it will experience a prolific source of multi-path components. In this paper, we comprehensively exploit the inherent physical parameters of the multi-path fading channel to achieve continuous two way authentication between wireless terminals. In our scheme, pilot information is randomly spread in a wideband channel, leading to low probability of detection (LPD). Unlike other channel-based approaches, the information of both amplitude and phase in the channel signature is fully utilized to enhance the security of the OFDM communication network. More specially, the receiver will detect the channel response continuously according to the randomly inserted pilots and identify the valid user based on the statistical channel signature information. Simulation results indicate the high efficiency of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05198999.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5198999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5198999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5198999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EPSON: Enhanced Physical Security in OFDM Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Communication system security","Information security","Wireless communication","Cryptography","Wireless networks","Bandwidth","Fading","Authentication","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","fading channels","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM networks","physical security enhancement","secure wireless communications","cryptographic schemes","multipath channel","fading channel","probability of detection","pilot information","wideband channel","channel response","statistical channel signature information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5198999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"EPSON: Enhanced Physical Security in OFDM Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5198999/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815610","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EPSON: Enhanced Physical Security in OFDM Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-10-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052103S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5198999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199001,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We propose analytically tractable methods that can be efficiently used to design spectrally efficient ED systems for short-range, wideband, and high data rate wireless communications in lognormal multipath fading channels with uncorrelated diversity paths.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199001/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Error Probability of Energy Detected Multilevel PAM Signals in Lognormal Multipath Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Probability of Energy Detected Multilevel PAM Signals in Lognormal Multipath Fading Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-25-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058498S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5199003,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In addition these codes support active user detection. We derive an upper bound on the number of users with a fixed spreading factor. Also we propose an ML decoder for a subclass of these codes that is computationally implementable. Although for our simulations we consider a scenario that is worse than what occurs in practice, simulation results indicate that this coding/decoding scheme is robust against additive noise. As an example, for 64 chips and 88 users we propose a coding/decoding scheme that can obtain an arbitrary small probability of error which is computationally feasible and can detect active users. Furthermore, we prove that for this to be possible the number of users cannot be beyond 230.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199003.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Errorless Codes for Over-Loaded CDMA with Active User Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Decoding","Additive noise","Upper bound","Computational modeling","Noise robustness","Multiuser detection","Bandwidth","Channel capacity","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error correction codes","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["errorless codes","over-loaded CDMA","synchronous wireless CDMA systems","active user detection","fixed spreading factor","ML decoder","coding-decoding scheme","error probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Errorless Codes for Over-Loaded CDMA with Active User Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199003/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815233","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Errorless Codes for Over-Loaded CDMA with Active User Detection","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-16-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077053S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199005,"authors":[{"name":"T.

With N transmit antennas, the maximum gain for EBF at a receiver is 20 log N decibels over a single antenna transmission (assuming a power unfair comparison where each transmit antenna has a fixed power so the addition of new antennas brings a beamforming gain as well as a total transmit power increase). Based on statistical analysis of field data and observations, this gain is nearly achievable with line-of- sight transmissions. While useful for characterizing the benefits of EBF, the statistical analysis does not indicate the realizable gain for a particular location. This paper presents a relationship between the EBF gain, spatial correlation of the channel, and the number of transmit antennas. The conjectured gain is compared to the expected gain based on an analysis of field data. The results of this comparison show that the spatial correlation as defined in this paper can be used to predict the EBF gain accurately for a variety of antenna spacings and polarizations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199005/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10815612","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199005/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Estimating Statistical Eigen-Beamforming Gains Using Spatial Channel Correlation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating Statistical Eigen-Beamforming Gains Using Spatial Channel Correlation","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-40-15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072409S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5199011,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The activities in many wireless standardization bodies and forums, for example IEEE 802.16 j/m and LTE-Advanced, attest to this fact. The availability or lack thereof of efficient radio resource management (RRM) could make or mar the opportunities in these networks. This paper therefore provides a comprehensive RRM algorithm for OFDMA-based multi-cellular fixed relay networks in a way to ensure fairness among users with minimal impact on the network throughput (in contrast, pure opportunistic RRM techniques always favor users with good channel conditions). Unlike the majority of works in the literature, our proposed scheme is queue-aware and jointly performs routing, fair scheduling, and load balancing among cell nodes. The routing strategy has inherent learning ability and it dynamically converges to better routes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199024.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fairness-Aware Joint Routing and Scheduling in OFDMA-Based Cellular Fixed Relay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Cellular networks","Relays","Frequency conversion","Wireless communication","Communication standards","Standardization","Availability","Resource management","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","resource allocation","scheduling","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fairness-aware joint routing","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","cellular fixed relay networks","radio resource management","network throughput","fair scheduling","load balancing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fairness-Aware Joint Routing and Scheduling in OFDMA-Based Cellular Fixed Relay Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199024/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815244","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fairness-Aware Joint Routing and Scheduling in OFDMA-Based Cellular Fixed Relay Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-38-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056672S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199025,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Assuming that the base station knows all the instantaneous channel gains of all links, we propose a dynamic joint subchannel and power allocation (SPA) scheme whose objective is to maximize the worst user's data rate with the constraint of total transmission power. Since the optimal solution to this combinatorial problem is extremely computationally complex, we propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm that allocates subchannel and power separately. In the proposed algorithm, subchannels are firstly paired by relay nodes according to their equivalent channel gains and then assigned to a specific user. Subsequently, an optimal power distribution algorithm is designed for the proposed subchannel allocation (SA) scheme. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm approaches asymptotically to that of the optimal one, and maximal fairness is guaranteed for all users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fairness-Aware Resource Allocation in OFDMA Cooperative Relaying Network","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199025","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199025.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fairness-Aware Resource Allocation in OFDMA Cooperative Relaying Network","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199025/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815137","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fairness-Aware Resource Allocation in OFDMA Cooperative Relaying Network","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-20-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060646S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199029,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Starting with a network utility maximization formulation of the problem, we derive distributed power control, transport rate and queue management schemes that jointly achieve the optimal network operation. Our solution has several attractive features compared to alternatives: it adheres to the natural time-scale separation between rapid power control updates and slower end-to-end rate adjustments, and uses simplified power control mechanisms with reduced signalling requirements. We argue that these features are critical for a successful real-world implementation. To validate these claims, we present a detailed implementation of a cross-layer adapted networking stack for DS-CSMA ad-hoc networks in ns-2. We describe several critical issues that arise in the implementation, but are typically neglected in the theoretical protocol design, and evaluate the alternatives in extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199029","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199029.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Power Control for Cross-Layer Optimal Resource Allocation in DS-CDMA Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199029/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Power Control for Cross-Layer Optimal Resource Allocation in DS-CDMA Wireless Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815627","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199029/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Power Control for Cross-Layer Optimal Resource Allocation in DS-CDMA Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-38-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055913S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199033,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In femtocell deployments, leakage of the pilot signal to the outside of a house can result in a highly increased signalling load to the core network as a result of the higher number of mobility events caused by passing users. In this paper, a low cost multi-element antenna solution is proposed to reduce the core network mobility signalling over previously published results using a single antenna only. Antenna gain pattern measurements of a prototype with two patches and two inverted F antennas are presented and a corresponding feeder network is discussed. Self-optimization methods are proposed that jointly select an appropriate antenna pattern and optimize the pilot power. This allows to better match the femtocell coverage to the shape of each individual house and results in an improvement of both indoor coverage and core network signalling resulting from mobility events.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199033","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199033.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell Coverage Optimization Using Switched Multi-Element Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell Coverage Optimization Using Switched Multi-Element Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199033/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815027","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199033/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell Coverage Optimization Using Switched Multi-Element Antennas","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-06-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057363S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199037,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

In SC systems, bandwidth efficiency can be effectively enhanced by the use of waveform shaping filter with low roll-off factor. However, as a price, non- negligible increase of PAR is incurred in pulse-shaped signals even for phase shift keying (PSK) modulation. To balance both low PAR and high bandwidth efficiency, the authors have recently proposed a novel PAR reduction technique for SC-PSK based on trellis shaping (TS). In this paper, we evaluate its effectiveness and feasibility through implementation with field programmable gate array (FPGA) and testbed experiments with a sample RF power amplifier (PA).","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199039","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199039.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Trellis Shaping to Control Peak Power for PSK Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199039/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of Trellis Shaping to Control Peak Power for PSK Signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815631","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199039/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of Trellis Shaping to Control Peak Power for PSK Signals","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-02-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063313S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199046,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In contrast, the proposed scheme restricts the search range utilizing the distribution of the perturbation vector depending on transmitted data. As a result, we can achieve significant complexity savings at the transmitter and the receiver while providing better performance compared to the conventional sphere encoder.

The proposed method consists of the following operations: timing synchronization, fractional carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation, fractional CFO compensation, and joint integer CFO and preamble index estimation. To estimate multiple fractional CFOs with pseudo-periodic preamble, we suggest an over-sampling approach. An ill-condition detection and noise suppression algorithm is also presented. For joint integer CFO and preamble index estimation, we use a differential detection based cross-correlation method. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method gives satisfactory performance for a wide SNR range even when the mobile station (MS) is on the cell boundaries.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Initial Synchronization for Multi-Cell OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199084","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199084.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Initial Synchronization for Multi-Cell OFDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199084/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815274","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Initial Synchronization for Multi-Cell OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-13-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078261S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199088,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We study the geometry factor and the Top-N power statistics in the non-cooperative case and compare the results with a commonly used spatial channel model. Furthermore we observe that the median delay parameters in a coherent single frequency network deployment are roughly 1.5 times higher than in an isolated cell while the maximum excess delays are similar in both cases. Finally we study the correlation of the channel response for different antenna spacings at the base station. When the sector antennas are close together, the correlation is generally high which is also predicted by the channel model, but with spacings of about 20 m the correlation significantly decreases.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199088","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199088.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intercell Interference Measured in Urban Areas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intercell Interference Measured in Urban Areas","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199088/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814770","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199088/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intercell Interference Measured in Urban Areas","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-09-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066187S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5199089,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We show that incorporating the impact of distance attenuation and lognormal fading on each constituent interferer in the aggregate, leads to a composite interference that cannot be satisfactorily modeled by a lognormal. Using the interference statistics we determine a number of key parameters needed for the deployment of CRs. Examples of these are the exclusion zone radius, needed to protect the primary receiver under different types of fading environments and acceptable interference levels, and the numbers of CRs that can be deployed. We further show that if the CRs have apriori knowledge of the radio environment map (REM), then a much larger number of CRs can be deployed especially in a high density environment. Given REM information, we also look at the CR numbers achieved by two different types of techniques to process the scheduling information.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199089","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199089.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199089","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference and Deployment Issues for Cognitive Radio Systems in Shadowing Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference and Deployment Issues for Cognitive Radio Systems in Shadowing Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199089/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199089/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815385","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference and Deployment Issues for Cognitive Radio Systems in Shadowing Environments","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-39-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084985S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5199090,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper, we study interference aware resource allocation in OFDMA based WRMNs and the effects of spatial reuse on throughput. We propose an interference aware subcarrier assignment (IASA) algorithm to allocate subcarriers to links in the network such that interference is mitigated and throughput is maximized. The protocol interference model and spatial reuse are exploited to achieve the subcarrier assignment. We show that our IASA algorithm improves throughput compared to when subcarriers are used only once. However, overuse of a single subcarrier can have detrimental effects on network performance, therefore a balance must be achieved. In addition, using a maximum concurrent flow (MCF) approach, we show that under the IASA scheme of spatial reuse, throughput can be enhanced. We formulate the MCF as a linear program and solve it using dual optimization techniques. We compare our proposed algorithm with that of a graph coloring approach using a conflict graph and column generation to show that our throughput results are better than those obtained by the link coloring strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199090","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199090.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Aware Subcarrier Assignment for Throughput Maximization in OFDMA Wireless Relay Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference Aware Subcarrier Assignment for Throughput Maximization in OFDMA Wireless Relay Mesh Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199090/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10826306","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199090/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Aware Subcarrier Assignment for Throughput Maximization in OFDMA Wireless Relay Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-07-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.136586S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199096,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Therefore power optimization techniques are becoming increasingly important in wireless system design. Power optimization schemes are also important for interference management in wireless systems as interference resulting from aggressive spectral reuse and high power transmission severely limits system performance. Although power optimization plays a pivotal role in both interference management and energy utilization, little research addresses their joint interaction. In this paper, we develop energy-efficient power optimization schemes for interference-limited communications. Both circuit and transmit powers are considered and energy efficiency is emphasized over throughput. We note that the general power optimization problem in the presence of interference is intractable even when ideal user cooperation is assumed. We first study this problem for a simple two-user network with ideal user cooperation and then develop a practical non-cooperative power optimization scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves not only energy efficiency but also spectral efficiency in an interference-limited cellular network.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199096","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199096.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-Aware Energy-Efficient Power Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference-Aware Energy-Efficient Power Optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814906","htmlLink":"/document/5199096/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference-Aware Energy-Efficient Power Optimization","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-18-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103227S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5199097,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In the classical approach the mobile station (MS) determines time difference of arrival (TDOA) information from the received signals of at least three base stations (BSs). With these TDOAs the location of the MS is estimated. However, only at the cell edge a good reception of several BSs is ensured. Especially for future systems targeting a frequency re-use of one, interference is a limiting factor. Hence, in the inner cell it is difficult to detect out-of-cell BSs with sufficient quality. Therefore, we propose an interference cancellation scheme to improve the performance in these critical situations for TDOA positioning. Simulation results for a 3GPP- LTE system show the ability of this approach to increase the accuracy and to extend the coverage of the overall location estimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference-Aware Location Estimation in Cellular OFDM Communications Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199097","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199097.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference-Aware Location Estimation in Cellular OFDM Communications Systems","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199097/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815164","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference-Aware Location Estimation in Cellular OFDM Communications Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-34-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058856S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199104,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However, the direct conversion from radio frequencies (RF) to complex inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) baseband signals in one mixing step introduces additional front-end distortions. These IQ distortions lead to a degradation in the system performance. The problem becomes more significant in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems where multiple user signals with different IQ impairments are combined in the uplink (UL) signal. In this paper, detection methods for OFDMA-UL signals corrupted by IQ distortions are investigated. The received signal as a function of transmitted signals, IQ parameters, and communication channels is mathematically formulated.

In CSM systems, the multiple relay stations (RSs), which compose a virtual antenna array (VAA), independently decode the packets received from the mobile stations (MS) and forward them to the base station (BS). When the BS decodes the signal forwarded from the RSs, the potential decoding errors encountered at the RSs will result in erroneous forwarding, but their effects are mitigated by the proposed solution. Our simulation results show that when the direct link has a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio than the relay link, the proposed decoding algorithm achieves an approximately 3 dB better performance than conventional CSM, which does not consider the deleterious effects of erroneous forwarding from the RSs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10814778","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199105/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Detection and Decoding for Hard-Decision Forwarding Aided Cooperative Spatial Multiplexing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Detection and Decoding for Hard-Decision Forwarding Aided Cooperative Spatial Multiplexing","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-08-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082999S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199106,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The two-way relay system requires two time slots to accomplish one information exchange. Compared to the traditional one-way relay system, which demands four time slots to complete one information exchange, our system only uses half as many time slots. Our proposed iterative receiver consists of two loops. One is the minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based iterative soft interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm which is extended from the algorithm in to cover correlated noise environment incurred from the nature of signalling. The other is the Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM)-based estimation algorithm. The MMSE-SIC algorithm provides the soft information of the transmitted signals and this information is transferred to the ECM-based estimation algorithm to update the channel information. Simulation results show that the performance of the iterative receiver proposed here is close to that given by perfect channel information with small number of iterations.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199107","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199107.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Receiver for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Two-Way Wireless Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199107","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Receiver for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Two-Way Wireless Relay Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199107/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815170","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199107/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Receiver for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Two-Way Wireless Relay Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-13-10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055147S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199108,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Further system performance improvements can be attained by employing channel coding, where the source bits are serial-to-parallel converted to two layers, each constituted by a serial concatenation of an outer code amalgamated with a unity-rate code for the sake of improving the convergence behaviour of the proposed system. Additionally, the convergence behaviour of the iteratively detected scheme is evaluated with the aid of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts.

Different from previous work, we assume only the mean and the covariance matrix are known for the channel state information (CSI) of the RS-mobile station(MS) link. Since the exact solution of this problem is difficult to be found because the RS-MS channel is only partially known, we employ precoding matrices that maximize the upper bound on the ergodic capacity. Based on this approach, the proposed scheme uses an iterative method to determine both BS and RS precoding matrices simultaneously. In numerical results, the proposed joint precoding scheme is shown to outperform the water-filling and amplify-and-forward (WF-AF) scheme in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. It is also shown to outperform the spatial multiplexing and RS precoding (SM-RP) scheme in low SNR regions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199119.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Precoding for MIMO-Relay Systems with Partial Channel State Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","Covariance matrix","Linear matrix inequalities","Relays","Iterative methods","Niobium","Downlink","Upper bound","MIMO","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","precoding","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-relay systems","partial channel state information","base station","relay station","ergodic capacity","downlink non-regenerative multiple-input multiple-output-relay systems","covariance matrix","mobile station link","joint precoding scheme","water-filling","amplify-and-forward","signal-to-noise ratio","spatial multiplexing","RS precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint Precoding for MIMO-Relay Systems with Partial Channel State Information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199119/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815403","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Precoding for MIMO-Relay Systems with Partial Channel State Information","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-08-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060621S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199121,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this paper we enable the buffering capability of relay nodes and propose a framework for joint scheduling and relay selection. The goal is to maximize the system long-term throughput by fully exploiting multi-user diversity in the network. We develop two joint scheduling and relay selection (JSRS) algorithms for unidirectional and bidirectional traffic, respectively. The novel cross-layer relay selection metrics which our algorithms are based upon take into account both instantaneous channel conditions and the queuing status. We also demonstrate that the proposed JSRS can be realized in a distributed way without explicit coordination among the network nodes. Extensive simulation is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed JSRS with buffering in comparison with traditional FTD without buffering. Typical throughput enhancements up to 101% and 110% are observed in one-way and two-way relay networks respectively, at low signal-to-noise ratio (0 dB).","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199121.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Scheduling and Relay Selection in One- and Two-Way Relay Networks with Buffering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system relaying","Throughput","Peer to peer computing","Traffic control","Frame relay","Scheduling algorithm","Communications Society","Telecommunication traffic","Signal to noise ratio","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","packet radio networks","queueing theory","scheduling","telecommunication channels","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless relay networks","fixed time division","buffering capability","relay node","multiuser network diversity","joint scheduling and relay selection algorithm","cross layer relay selection metrics","queuing status","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint Scheduling and Relay Selection in One- and Two-Way Relay Networks with Buffering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199121/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814664","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Scheduling and Relay Selection in One- and Two-Way Relay Networks with Buffering","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-21-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079208S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199122,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However, the design of the corresponding joint transmit and receive (Tx/Rx) ABF optimization algorithms is still challenging in the case of multipath channels due to the constraint of having only one scalar weight per antenna. In this paper, we aim at maximizing the average signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the input of the equalizer and analytically derive close-to-optimal Tx/Rx scalar weights. We show that the required channel state information (CSI) for joint Tx/Rx ABF weights computation is the inner product between all Tx/Rx channel impulse response pairs. Taking the channel length into account, a training-based estimation strategy of this CSI is proposed. Simulation results carried out in a typical 60 GHz multipath environment show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing ABF schemes in term of BER performances.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199125","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199125.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Transmit and Receive Analog Beamforming in 60 GHz MIMO Multipath Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199125/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Transmit and Receive Analog Beamforming in 60 GHz MIMO Multipath Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814668","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199125/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Transmit and Receive Analog Beamforming in 60 GHz MIMO Multipath Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-41-12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054738S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199126,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The LR-aided SIC schemes have been extensively studied to detect multiple users' symbols due to the nearly optimal performance. However, the LR algorithm and the sequential detecting method inherently incur considerable computational complexity overhead although it is of a polynomial order. To reduce their computational complexities, we decouple the entire system into multiple lower dimensional subsystems using linear pre-equalization based on the correlation among the users. We then utilize the LR-aided SIC parallel in each subsystem. Furthermore, to combine the LR-aided SIC with pre-equalization optimally, we modify the LR-aided SIC scheme, handling the residual interferences after pre-equalization.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199130.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice Reduction Aided Multi-User MIMO Successive Interference Cancellation Combined with Linear Pre-Equalization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","MIMO","Interference cancellation","Silicon carbide","Computational complexity","Maximum likelihood detection","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Communications Society","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","correlation methods","equalisers","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lattice reduction","correlated multiuser MIMO successive interference cancellation","linear preequalization","multiple user detection","computational complexity","polynomial order","multiple lower dimensional subsystem","MMSE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Lattice Reduction Aided Multi-User MIMO Successive Interference Cancellation Combined with Linear Pre-Equalization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199130/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815518","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice Reduction Aided Multi-User MIMO Successive Interference Cancellation Combined with Linear Pre-Equalization","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-41-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049638S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199135,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In this paper, we first introduce a low-complexity CSI feedback scheme, by exploiting the temporal correlation of practical channels, to improve the efficiency of feedback. Then, a modified BD algorithm is proposed to further utilize the channel correlation in time domain.

However, as the mobility in the system increases and one has to maintain a high accuracy in channel estimation, the pilot overhead typically has to be increased. Emerging cellular OFDM standards are expected to use about 6 - 12% pilot overhead per stream, and any possible reduction in pilot overhead would be useful. Decision directed channel tracking (DDCT) can help reduce pilot overhead, but is known to suffer from error propagation at high fade rates. In emerging broadband wireless systems promising peak bit rates of 50 Mbps or more, saving on pilot overhead by using DDCT schemes would be highly attractive provided: (a) Such a DDCT approach does not suffer from error propagation and has an error rate performance comparable to (or better than) PACT schemes even at high fade rates; (b) The computational complexity of such a DDCT approach is not significantly more than that of the MMSE based PACT scheme. In this work, we propose a low complexity DDCT method which exploits the structure of the regression matrix in conjunction with robust statistics to mitigate the effect of error propagation. It has a much lower computational complexity and a better error rate performance than the decision directed EM-Kalman and other existing robust statistics based DDCT schemes. The proposed method also outperforms a 12.5% pilot overhead based PACT scheme with only a modest increase in computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199151","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199151.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Decision Directed Channel Tracking for High Mobility OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199151/","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Decision Directed Channel Tracking for High Mobility OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814934","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199151/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Decision Directed Channel Tracking for High Mobility OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-13-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038398S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5199152,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Therefore, GQC codes, unlike quasi-cyclic codes, can include many important codes such as Hermitian and projective geometry (PG) codes; this capability is important in practical applications. Further, we propose the echelon canonical form algorithm for computing Grobner bases from their parity check matrices. Consequently, by applying Grobner base theory, GQC codes can be systematically encoded and implemented with simple feedback shift registers. Our algorithm is based on Gaussian elimination and requires a sufficiently small number of finite-field operations, which is related to the third power of code-length. In order to demonstrate our encoder's efficiency, we prove that the number of circuit elements in the encoder architecture is proportional to the code-length for finite geometry (FG) LDPC codes (a class of GQC codes). We show that the hardware complexity of a serial-in-serial-out encoder architecture for FG-LDPC codes is related to the linear order of the code-length; less than 2n adder and 2n memory elements are required to encode a binary codeword of length n.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199152/","accessionNumber":"10814937","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Encoder for Generalized Quasi-Cyclic Codes Coming from Finite Geometries","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Encoder for Generalized Quasi-Cyclic Codes Coming from Finite Geometries","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-16-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106164S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199153,"authors":[{"name":"R.-H.

Using the tool of factor graph, we propose a novel parallel processing algorithm that reduces the processing delay by orders of magnitude. Numerical results show that, both the sequential and parallel processing SISO equalizers perform similarly well and achieve a performance that is only slightly worse than the optimum SISO equalizer.

The resource allocation in an OFDMA system is normally modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem involving a nonlinear objective with nonlinear constraints. This leads to high computation complexity that is only solvable online. In this paper we first develop a nonlinear optimization model of OFDMA resource allocation that incorporates not only the throughput constraint but also the delay constraint. We then find an equivalent linear formulation to this optimization problem to facilitate analysis. Moreover, we develop a heuristic approximation algorithm to provide a close solution to the equivalent linear programming problem. The heuristic algorithm is efficient enough for on-line adaptive resource allocation. Simulation results show that the heuristic solution can achieve almost same capacity but with less computation complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199154","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199154.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Resource Allocation Algorithm for IEEE 802.16 OFDMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199154/","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Resource Allocation Algorithm for IEEE 802.16 OFDMA System","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815417","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199154/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Resource Allocation Algorithm for IEEE 802.16 OFDMA System","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-11-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035692S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199155,"authors":[{"name":"C.-L.

For mobile devices in a cellular system, uplink power consumption dominates the wireless power budget, due to the RF power requirements for reliable communications over long distances. Our previous work in this area demonstrated significant energy savings in uplink cellular OFDMA transmissions, with iterative approaches maximizing the instantaneous bits-per- Joule energy efficiency. In this paper, we use a time-averaged bits-per-Joule metric to develop low-complexity schemes. Specifically, we obtain closed-form solutions for energy-efficient link adaptation in frequency-selective channels. We also derive closed- form approaches for the maximum arithmetic and geometric mean energy-efficient schedulers. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes not only have low complexity but also perform close to the globally optimum solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199158","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199158.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Energy-Efficient OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199158/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Energy-Efficient OFDMA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815421","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199158/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Energy-Efficient OFDMA","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-12-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077236S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5199161,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Much previous research in TH-UWB receiver design has attempted to propose better single-user UWB detectors by introducing more accurate models for the distribution of the MAI. Recently, it was shown that some of the single-user receivers track closely the optimum achievable single-user performance. Although, these receivers are simple, all suffer from error rate floors, and hence limited user capacity. Multiuser detection (MUD) is considered for offering high performance at the cost of complexity that grows exponentially with the number of users. Thought to be too complex for low-cost UWB receivers, MUD applied in TH-UWB systems benefits from the low duty cycle implying that the number of effective interfering users is small compared to the number of active users. A novel low-complexity multisampling multiuser detector inspired by the inferiority of single-user receivers and the small number of effective interfering users in TH-UWB systems is proposed. Simulation results show that this detector achieves the performance of the conventional matched filter receiver operating in a single-user system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Multiple access interference","Multiuser detection","Ultra wideband technology","Frequency","Wireless communication","Receivers","Matched filters","FCC","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","multi-access systems","multiuser detection","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity multisampling multiuser detector","time-hopping UWB system","multiple access interference","time hopping","ultra-wideband systems","TH-UWB system","single-user receiver","interfering users","matched filter receiver","single-user system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199161","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199161.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Multisampling Multiuser Detector for Time-Hopping UWB Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Multisampling Multiuser Detector for Time-Hopping UWB Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199161/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199161/","accessionNumber":"10815177","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Multisampling Multiuser Detector for Time-Hopping UWB Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-16-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065961S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199161","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199165,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Modeling OFDM systems for the analysis of network performance is very challenging, because of the complexity of the modulation/coding schemes and the wideband wireless channel fading in both the time and frequency domains. In this paper, a novel packet-level model based on a two-dimensional Markov chain is proposed for OFDM systems over time-varying (Nakagami-m fading), frequency-selective channels. First, the level cross rate (LCR) of the amplitude of channel frequency response is derived. Then, we develop a methodology to map the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the subcarriers into a finite number of channel states with different packet error rate (PER). The proposed model presents directly the performance of the OFDM systems and incorporates the time- and frequency-domain correlations of the fading channels. Channel coding is also considered in evaluating PER. Simulations have verified that the statistics of the BER presented by our model are consistent with those of waveform simulations. The proposed Markov model can be an effective tool to study and optimize upper-layer protocols of OFDM-based wireless networks, via both analysis and simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Markov Modeling for Data Block Transmission of OFDM Systems over Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199167","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199167.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Markov Modeling for Data Block Transmission of OFDM Systems over Fading Channels","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199167/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815306","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov Modeling for Data Block Transmission of OFDM Systems over Fading Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-16-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085389S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199175,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This paper presents a new wideband MIMO (multiple-input- multiple-output) channel model for VTV channels based on extensive MIMO channel measurements performed at 5.2 GHz in rural environments in Lund, Sweden. The measured channel characteristics, in particular the non-stationarity of the channel statistics, motivate the use of a geometry-based stochastic channel model (GSCM) instead of the classical tapped-delay line model. We introduce generalizations of the generic GSCM approach and find it suitable to distinguish between diffuse and discrete scattering contributions. The time-variant contributions from discrete scatterers are tracked over time and delay using a high resolution algorithm, and our observations motivate their power being modeled as a combination of a deterministic part and a stochastic part. The paper gives a full model parameterization and the model is verified by comparison of MIMO antenna correlations derived from the channel model to those obtained directly from measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199175.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement-Based Modeling of Vehicle-to-Vehicle MIMO Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Stochastic processes","Solid modeling","Scattering","Traffic control","Vehicle safety","Communication system traffic","Wideband","Performance evaluation","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadband networks","MIMO communication","mobile radio","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement-based modeling","vehicle-to-vehicle MIMO channels","vehicle-to-vehicle communications","traffic safety","congestion avoidance","suitable communications systems","discrete scattering contributions","diffuse scattering contributions","time-variant contributions","high resolution algorithm","MIMO antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Measurement-Based Modeling of Vehicle-to-Vehicle MIMO Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199175/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815182","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement-Based Modeling of Vehicle-to-Vehicle MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-09-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11686S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199179,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In the proposed approach each transmitter iteratively sends and receives information messages to/from the base station with the goal of achieving an optimal resource allocation strategy. The exchanged messages are the solution of small distributed allocation problems. To reduce the computational load, the MP problems at the terminals follow a dynamic programming formulation. The advantage of the proposed scheme is that it distributes the computational effort among all the transmitters in the cell and it does not require the presence of a central controller that takes all the decisions. Numerical results show that the proposed approach is an excellent solution to the resource allocation problem for cellular multi-carrier systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199180","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199180.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Message passing resource allocation for the uplink of multicarrier systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199180","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Message passing resource allocation for the uplink of multicarrier systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199180/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815079","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199180/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message passing resource allocation for the uplink of multicarrier systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-26-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077279S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199180","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5199181,"authors":[{"name":"T.

These are necessary criteria for emerging sensor networks, which oftentimes have very short distance communication requirements, necessitate low power operation and may require high data rates (e.g., for supporting the transmission of images or video). In this paper, using detailed models of typical IR-UWB transmitter/receiver structures, we minimize the energy consumption per information bit in a single link of an IR-UWB system, considering packet retransmissions and overhead. This minimization is realized by finding the optimum packet length and the optimum number of RAKE fingers at the receiver for different transmission distances, using differential BPSK (DBPSK) and OOK with coherent and non-coherent detection. Our results show that at very short distances, it is optimum to use OOK with non-coherent detection and large packets, and at longer distances, it is optimum to use DBPSK with coherent detection and small packets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Wireless sensor networks","RAKE receivers","Power system modeling","Radio transmitters","Diversity methods","Fingers","Monitoring","Bandwidth","Automatic repeat request"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","differential phase shift keying","packet radio networks","radio receivers","radio transmitters","signal detection","ultra wideband communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption minimization","IR-UWB based wireless sensor networks","impulse radio ultrawideband communication","low power operation","IR-UWB transmitter-receiver structures","packet retransmission","packet overhead","RAKE fingers","differential BPSK","OOK","noncoherent signal detection","coherent signal detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199181","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199181.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing Energy Consumption in IR-UWB Based Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing Energy Consumption in IR-UWB Based Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199181/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199181/","accessionNumber":"10814678","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing Energy Consumption in IR-UWB Based Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01-15-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042557S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5199182,"authors":[{"name":"Q.-T.

Comparisons with maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) strategy and other precoders based on criteria, such as water-filling (WF), minimum mean square error (MMSE), and maximization of the minimum singular value of the global channel matrix, are performed to illustrate the significant bit-error-rate (BER) improvement of the proposed precoder.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of cooperative communications on mitigating the effect of channel estimation error. Two main performance criteria, namely, the traditional outage probability and the proposed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gap ratio, are utilized to characterize such impact. The SNR gap ratio measures the reduction in the SNR due to channel estimation error. Taking into consideration the channel estimation error, we show that the outage probability is reduced by utilizing cooperative transmission. We also show that cooperative transmission results in lower SNR gap ratio compared to that of the direct transmission. Thus, cooperative transmission is less susceptible to the effect of channel estimation error compared to direct transmission. Finally, we illustrate that increasing the number of cooperating relays reduces the effect of the channel estimation error more.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199186.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigating channel estimation error via cooperative communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Relays","Data communication","Wireless networks","Computer errors","Phase estimation","Degradation","Signal to noise ratio","Decoding","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-to-noise ratio gap ratio","outage probability","wireless networks","cooperative communications","channel estimation error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Mitigating channel estimation error via cooperative communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199186/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199186/","accessionNumber":"10815087","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigating channel estimation error via cooperative communications","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-31-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065369S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199187,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

They flood the victim with service requests generated from numerous bots. Attack requests are identical in content to those generated by legitimate, human users, and bots send at a low rate to appear non-aggressive - these features defeat many existing DDoS defenses. We propose defenses against flash-crowd attacks via human behavior modeling, which differentiate DDoS bots from human users. Current approaches to human-vs-bot differentiation, such as graphical puzzles, are insufficient and annoying to humans, whereas our defenses are highly transparent. We model three aspects of human behavior: a) request dynamics, by learning several chosen features of human interaction dynamics, and detecting bots that exhibit higher aggressiveness in one or more of these features, b) request semantics, by learning transitional probabilities of user requests, and detecting bots that generate valid but low-probability sequences, and c) ability to process visual cues, by embedding into server replies human-invisible objects, which cannot be detected by automated analysis, and flagging users that visit them as bots. We evaluate our defenses' performance on a series of Web traffic logs, interlaced with synthetically generated attacks, and conclude that they raise the bar for a successful, sustained attack to botnets whose size is larger than the size observed in 1-5% of DDoS attacks today.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199191","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199191.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Computer crime","Floods","Object detection","Face detection","Event detection","Telecommunication traffic","Communications Society","Distributed computing","Peer to peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash-crowd attacks","human behavior modeling","distributed denial of service","service requests","DDoS defense","human-vs-bot differentiation","graphical puzzles","request dynamics","human interaction dynamics","request semantics","Web traffic logs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Human Behavior for Defense Against Flash-Crowd Attacks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199191/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199191/","accessionNumber":"10814812","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Human Behavior for Defense Against Flash-Crowd Attacks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-03-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08814S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199191","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5199201,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In a full mesh mode, a WiMAX node acts as a mesh router as well as a client access node. To improve latency and speed performance, typical dual- and multi-radio mesh solutions use different radio channels to create separate links for access and mesh relaying services. The available spectrum is therefore split between mesh and client access services. Network operators operating the WiMAX system over the licensed spectrum are not keen to provide separate radio channels for access and mesh relay services, as this reduces the total number of users serviced per spectrum allocation. MIMO-multiplexing relaying approach however provides separate links for access and mesh relaying services on the same radio channel. In this paper, we discuss the multi-hop capacity of OFDM-based MIMO-multiplexing relaying in WiMAX networks. For an NxN MIMO-multiplexing relaying with amplification factor alpha at relay nodes, R-hops relaying degrade the capacity by at most -Nlog\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(alpha\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2R</sup>\n/(1 +Sigma\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sup>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r-1</sub>\n alpha\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2r</sup>\nN\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sup>\n)) + \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RN</i>\n/log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n(N) bits/sec/Hz. Therefore, greater capacity loss is experienced in networks employing high-order MIMO- multiplexing relaying. We also show that the capacity loss is independent of the OFDM configurations employed; thus network operators could employ higher OFDM configurations to compensate data rate loss in access services when some of the MIMO-multiplexing links are dedicated to mesh relay. This analysis provides useful guidelines for operators planning MIMO-multiplexing option for mesh support in WiMAX network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199201.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Hop Capacity of MIMO-Multiplexing Relaying in WiMAX Mesh Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Relays","WiMAX","Mesh networks","MIMO","Peer to peer computing","OFDM","Base stations","Physical layer","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","MIMO communication","multiplexing","relays","telecommunication services","WiMax","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multihop capacity","MIMO","multiplexing","WiMAX","mesh networks","mesh router","channels","access relay service","mesh relay service","capacity loss","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Hop Capacity of MIMO-Multiplexing Relaying in WiMAX Mesh Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199201/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814690","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Hop Capacity of MIMO-Multiplexing Relaying in WiMAX Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-41-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045721S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5199203,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Our results suggest that, under investigated scenarios, proposed approach can achieve reliable communication without fast depleting energy resources of individual sensor nodes. In particular, we propose a framework in which nodes collaborate, in a distributed fashion, to provide robustness against channel induced errors as data traverses the multi-hop network. Our scheme builds on two core concepts: partial decoding of incoming packets at intermediate nodes & directed diffusion of interest over the network for selective event based reliable path reinforcement. In addition, we use path diversity with selective budgeting of network energy resources to achieve data reliability. We show that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional error robustness approaches by considerable margin for a given network energy budget. We further discuss energy-distortion tradeoffs that may lead to greater network lifetime along-with maintaining a desired level of throughput. We use iteratively decodable LDPC codes to illustrate efficiency of our scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199203","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199203.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath Distributed Data Reliability for Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multipath Distributed Data Reliability for Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199203/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815098","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199203/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath Distributed Data Reliability for Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01-13-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05617S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199206,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The first approach involves precomputing some products that are so far recomputed for each path expansion. The second technique is a new method to compute the path metrics. In all K-best detection techniques proposed so far, the complexity necessary to expand a path grows with the path depth in the tree. The originality of our approach stems from the fact that the path expansion complexity decreases with the path depth. Since the number of expanded paths increases with their depth, our approach better balances the path expansion complexity and the number of expanded paths at a given depth, which can yield a significant complexity reduction. We then present a new K-best Hard-Output Lattice Decoding (K-HOLD) algorithm that combines both proposed techniques. A complexity analysis shows that K-HOLD can reduce by up to 70% the overall path expansion complexity as compared to the less-complex known algorithms. This advantage comes about at no cost in terms of performance degradation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Approaches for Lowering Path Expansion Complexity of K-Best MIMO Detection Algorithms","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199220","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199220.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"New Approaches for Lowering Path Expansion Complexity of K-Best MIMO Detection Algorithms","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199220/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815100","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Approaches for Lowering Path Expansion Complexity of K-Best MIMO Detection Algorithms","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-23-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107844S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199224,"authors":[{"name":"J.

By utilising well designed pulse shapes and removing CP, OFDM/OQAM has the advantage of reduced out- of-band energy and a theoretically higher spectral efficiency. However, channel estimation over doubly dispersive channels has been a big problem for OFDM/OQAM due to the non- orthogonality between the real and imaginary parts of its modulated signals. Therefore conventional channel estimation (CE) methods used for OFDM cannot be directly applied to OFDM/OQAM. Recently a preamble-based CE method - interference approximation method (IAM) - has been proposed to ease this task. By treating the intrinsic interference from neighbour symbols as known information, two heuristic preamble sequences have been constructed based on tentative observations, which turn out to be suboptimal. In this paper, we present a general theoretical framework for IAM preamble design and apply it to identify the optimal IAM preamble sequence which results in a higher gain. Numerical results have verified the effectiveness of the theoretical framework and a gain of 2.4 dB against CP- OFDM has been demonstrated with the new preamble in various doubly dispersive channels with a QPSK modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199226.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Preamble-Based Channel Estimation for OFDM/OQAM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Interference","Dispersion","Paper technology","Communication systems","Communications technology","Pulse shaping methods","Shape","OFDM modulation","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preamble-based channel estimation","OFDM/OQAM systems","cyclic prefix","doubly dispersive channels","interference approximation method","QPSK modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel Preamble-Based Channel Estimation for OFDM/OQAM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199226/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814964","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Preamble-Based Channel Estimation for OFDM/OQAM Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-34-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051705S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199227,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It has recently been shown that sparse-graph linear codes followed by shaping techniques, combined with message-passing decoding, can enable practical timing channel codes with low symbol error rates near the capacity. The previous work had two main drawbacks. First, the shaping technique was only effective for very large finite field sizes. Secondly, the complexity of the message-passing decoder was quadratic in the block length. In this work, 1) we develop an alternative shaping technique using random dithers with provably good statistical guarantees; 2) we exploit Little's Law from queuing theory along with a large deviations argument to reduce the message-passing decoder's complexity from quadratic to linear in block length. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach on simulated queuing systems with low symbol error rates near the capacity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199227/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199227/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815564","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel Shaping and Complexity-Reduction Techniques for Approaching Capacity over Queuing Timing Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Shaping and Complexity-Reduction Techniques for Approaching Capacity over Queuing Timing Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-09-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068566S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199228,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Then, subspace techniques are utilized to estimate the noise subspace of this covariance matrix, and the dimension of the noise subspace is estimated using information theory criteria (AIC or MDL).

CTRMA uses OFDMA to enable each node to either send or receive multiple concurrent transmissions over orthogonal subchannels (groupings of subcarriers). With CTRMA, a node transmits multiple transmissions at the same time by negotiating the subchannels over which transmissions take place by using information attained with a channel priority assignment algorithm. CTRMA supports dynamic bandwidth selection and enhances channel reuse. We prove the correctness of CTRMA and use simulation experiments to illustrate the major performance advantages of CTRMA over prior channel access protocols proposed for single-radio single-channel, single-radio multi-channel and multi-radio multi-channel wireless ad hoc networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199230","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199230.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA Based Multiparty Medium Access Control in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA Based Multiparty Medium Access Control in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199230/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815332","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199230/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA Based Multiparty Medium Access Control in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01-09-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056793S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199231,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Fixed GoB scheduling relies on the knowledge of the location of the intended users as well as the vulnerable users which effectively is provided by the BB protocol via exploitation of channel reciprocity. This paper studies the hybrid BB and GoB (BB + GoB) approach in a Manhattan environment. The new proposed hybrid interference avoidance scheme with an underlying score based scheduler is evaluated by means of system level simulations, and is compared against a pure GoB approach with the same scheduler as well as the BB based interference avoidance techniques applied to omnidirectional antennas. The results show an improvement in both system throughput and fairness (defined as cell edge user throughput). In particular, system throughput of up to 238.5 Mbps/cell or user throughput of up to 8.88 Mbps/user for the lower 10%-ile of users are shown to be feasible. In particular, the hybrid BB + GoB scheme exhibits a 16-fold improvement at the lower 10%-ile compared to pure GoB technique.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199231","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA-TDD Networks with Busy Burst Enabled Grid-of-Beam Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA-TDD Networks with Busy Burst Enabled Grid-of-Beam Selection","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199231/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814968","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199231/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA-TDD Networks with Busy Burst Enabled Grid-of-Beam Selection","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-12-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062537S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199232,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The proposed sampling strategy is formulated based on the network traffic condition. It is constituted by two important functions namely the traffic identification and the sampling decision. While the former utilizes spectral analysis to identify the severity status of the traffic flows, the latter exploits both the flow status and flow size to compute the optimal sampling rate. In addition, a renormalization process is proposed to address the scalability issue in the network. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed technique is efficient in providing adequate statistics for detecting anomaly traffic and scales well to the high speed traffic of NGMN.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199232.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Accurate and Scalable Anomaly Detection in Next Generation Mobile Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Next generation networking","Sampling methods","Telecommunication traffic","Scalability","Spine","Quality of service","Mice","Spectral analysis","Statistical analysis","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","sampling methods","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable anomaly detection","next generation mobile network","adaptive sampling strategy","network traffic identification","spectral analysis","renormalization process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Accurate and Scalable Anomaly Detection in Next Generation Mobile Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199232/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815333","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Accurate and Scalable Anomaly Detection in Next Generation Mobile Network","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-16-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051246S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199233,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

While a variety of ADRS is ready for deployment, there lacks a sound and formal way to examine their operational characteristics for selecting the most appropriate ones with particular concerns. To that end, this paper develops a decision-theoretical framework to identify the fundamental tradeoffs between the key evaluation metrics of ADRS in MANET, along with a formal method to optimize the overall performance of ADRS in terms of those metrics of concern. In particular, each ADRS sensor is treated as an autonomous agent, making its decision as the local operational environment and a global signal that estimates the performance of ADRS as a whole, in terms of detection performance (detection accuracy and false positive rate) and operational cost (detection cost and response cost). The theoretical framework then serves as a basis for developing policy gradient algorithms for practically and automatically inferring the optimal behavior of ADRS sensors. A set of simulations is conducted for validating the feasibility and evaluating the performance of our proposed framework.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199233","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199233.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Achieving Cost-Sensitive Anomaly Detection and Response in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199233/","displayDocTitle":"On Achieving Cost-Sensitive Anomaly Detection and Response in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815566","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199233/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Achieving Cost-Sensitive Anomaly Detection and Response in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-06-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044127S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199235,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Although the asymptotic LDPC code design remains the same as for a memoryless erasure channel, robustness to the channel correlation shall be guaranteed for the finite length LDPC code. This further requirement is of great importance in several wireless communication scenarios where packet erasure correcting codes represent a simple countermeasure for correlated fade events (e.g., in mobile wireless broadcasting services) and where the channel coherence time is often comparable with the code length. In this paper, the maximum tolerable erasure burst length (MTBL) is adopted as a simple metric for measuring the code robustness to the channel correlation. Correspondingly, a further step in the code construction is suggested, consisting of improving the LDPC code MTBL. Numerical results conducted over a Gilbert erasure channel, under both iterative and maximum likelihood decoding, highlight both the importance of the MTBL improvement in the finite-length code construction and the possibility to tightly approach the performance of maximum distance separable codes.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199238","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199238.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Construction of Moderate-Length LDPC Codes over Correlated Erasure Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199238/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Construction of Moderate-Length LDPC Codes over Correlated Erasure Channels","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10815335","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199238/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Construction of Moderate-Length LDPC Codes over Correlated Erasure Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-22-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081238S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199242,"authors":[{"name":"F.

There, modulated symbols are multiplexed on multiple transmission antennas. Typically an outer error correcting code is used additionally to ensure a desired quality of service for a given data rate. An appropriate communications performance can be achieved by iterative decoding, where probabilistic information are exchanged between outer decoder and the MIMO demodulator. However, in this case the MIMO demodulator has to calculate probabilistic soft-output values for each bit which can be very complex. In this paper we present a new class of linear block codes named low-density MIMO codes which reduces the complexity of the MIMO soft-demodulator and the outer channel decoder inherently by code design without decreasing the data rate of the overall system. These LDMC codes can have a better communications performance then state of the art solutions with a order of magnitude smaller decoding complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199242","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199242.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Low-Density MIMO Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Low-Density MIMO Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199242/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815576","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199242/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Low-Density MIMO Codes","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-41-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085623S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199246,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this paper, we discuss how the CNF network architecture can be designed for efficient content retrieval. We first introduce several specific services provided in CNF network which are centered around content handling and mobile access. We then give an overview of the CNF protocol stack, which is built on top of IP, and consists of a data plane and a control plane. We provide detailed descriptions of each protocol within both planes. Then we present two caching algorithms, where one involves each CNF router making independent decisions on content caching while the other coordinates node caching within an autonomous system (AS) through hashing. Finally, we gave the initial simulation results to show the performance benefits of hop-by-hop transport and content caching.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Cache-and-Forward Network Architecture","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199249","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199249.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Cache-and-Forward Network Architecture","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199249/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814988","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Cache-and-Forward Network Architecture","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"06-02-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053358S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199252,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, an inherent drawback of this scheme is the severe performance degradation of the less protected LP stream. In this paper, we propose a concatenated encoding scheme that mixes the two streams in order to make the encoding of the LP stream dependent on the well protected HP stream. Consequently, at the receiver side, the reliable information on HP bits provided by the HP decoder is naturally involved in the decoding process of the LP stream and acts as \"soft pilots\". We have exploited this feature inside a soft decoding mechanism in order to improve the LP decoding performance while keeping the HP decoding performance unchanged. Numerical results presented in the case of the DVB-SH standard show that the proposed system outperforms the classical approach in terms of LP bit error rate without a considerable increase in the receiver complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199255.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199255","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel coding","Modulation coding","Decoding","Digital video broadcasting","Protection","Concatenated codes","Bit error rate","Transmitters","Clouds","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","digital video broadcasting","error statistics","modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","hierarchical modulation","bit stream","nonuniformly spaced constellation points","error protection","DVB-SH","bit error rate","radio receivers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Interaction Between Channel Coding and Hierarchical Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815579","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199255/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199255/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Interaction Between Channel Coding and Hierarchical Modulation","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-18-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041522S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5199259,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A half-duplex relay node establishes bidirectional communication between two nodes using a decode-and-forward protocol. In the initial multiple access phase both nodes transmit their messages to the relay node. In the succeeding phase the relay broadcasts an optimal re-encoded message so that both nodes can decode the other's message using their own message as side information. We show that if the channels are orthogonal then there exist equivalent transmit strategies with different ranks. The study of special cases reveals some of the difficult structure of the optimal solution. In particular a closed form procedure for the case of full rank transmission for invertible channels is derived. Moreover, for parallel channels the optimal solution is completely characterized and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199259","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199259.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Optimal Transmission for the MIMO Bidirectional Broadcast Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199259/","displayDocTitle":"On the Optimal Transmission for the MIMO Bidirectional Broadcast Channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815581","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199259/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Optimal Transmission for the MIMO Bidirectional Broadcast Channel","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-08-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086398S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199262,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We derive closed-form expressions for the symbol error probability, outage probability and channel capacity. In particular, we derive a closed-form expression for the probability density function of the signal-to-noise ratio of the relayed signal at the destination node. Then, we find a closed-form expression for the moment generating function of the total SNR at the destination. This MGF is used to derive the closed-form expressions of the performance metrics.

Since it seems impossible to guarantee complete protection to a system by means of the \"classical\" prevention mechanisms, the use of Intrusion Detection Systems has emerged as a key element in network security. In this paper we address the problem considering some techniques for detecting network anomalies. Our approach is based on the use of different compression algorithms for detecting anomalies in the network traffic running over TCP. In more detail we take into account the use of three different compression algorithms, based on distinct approaches, namely: Huffman coding, Dynamic Markov Coding, and Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm. The proposed methods are based on the consideration that the entropy represents a lower bound to the compression rate that we can obtain, and that the more redundant the data are and the better we can compress them. The performance analysis, presented in this paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199270.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Use of Compression Algorithms for Network Anomaly Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compression algorithms","Intrusion detection","Image coding","Data security","Protection","Huffman coding","Entropy","Internet","Cryptography","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","Internet","Markov processes","security of data","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection","security attacks","Internet","intrusion detection systems","network security","compression algorithms","network traffic","TCP","Huffman coding","dynamic Markov coding","Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of Compression Algorithms for Network Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199270/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814730","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of Compression Algorithms for Network Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-03-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043224S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199271,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Many publications exist that predict strong achievable rate improvements, but usually neglecting various practical issues connected to network MIMO. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a constrained backhaul infrastructure and imperfect channel knowledge on uplink network MIMO from an information theoretical point of view. Especially the latter aspect leads to the fact that the channel conditions for which network MIMO is reasonably beneficial are strongly constrained. We observe different base station cooperation schemes in scenarios of maximal 3 base stations and 3 terminals, provide simulation results, and discuss the practicability of the discussed schemes and the implications of our results.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199272","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199272.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Uplink Network MIMO under a Constrained Backhaul and Imperfect Channel Knowledge","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199272/","displayDocTitle":"On Uplink Network MIMO under a Constrained Backhaul and Imperfect Channel Knowledge","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815596","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199272/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Uplink Network MIMO under a Constrained Backhaul and Imperfect Channel Knowledge","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-10-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055368S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199274,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Direct modulation of LD with an EOM is cost effective compared to two cascaded EOMs, and exhibits a gain of 5 dB in the received optical power. A minimum error vector magnitude (EVM) of 18% and 20% are measured for direct modulation of LD with an EOM and two cascaded EOMs techniques, respectively which complies with MB-OFDM standard.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Techniques for Up-Conversion of MB-OFDM Signals in 60 Ghz Band Using Fiber Bragg Grating","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199276","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199276.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optical Techniques for Up-Conversion of MB-OFDM Signals in 60 Ghz Band Using Fiber Bragg Grating","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199276/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815350","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Techniques for Up-Conversion of MB-OFDM Signals in 60 Ghz Band Using Fiber Bragg Grating","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-40-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054141S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199277,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The random bipartite graph theory is used to model and analyze this diversity-multiplexing tradeoff problem. In particular, the maximum proper f-matching is introduced as a subcarrier allocation method which can minimize the user outage probability with fairness assurance given some multiplexing requirements.

Operating the amplifier solely in the linear region, i.e., with a large output back-off, results in an undistorted transmitted signal, but at the expense of a low SNR at the receiver. Driving the amplifier into saturation, on the other hand, maximizes the received SNR, but causes severe nonlinear signal distortions. In this paper we study the resulting tradeoff. We show both theoretically and by simulations that, despite the distortions, it is optimal to operate the amplifier close to saturation. Furthermore, we analytically derive a modification of the Bussgang noise cancellation algorithm which was recently shown in the literature to improve the EXIT characteristic of the algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Output Back-Off in OFDM Systems with Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199282","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199282.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199282","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Output Back-Off in OFDM Systems with Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199282/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815470","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Output Back-Off in OFDM Systems with Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-40-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059493S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199283,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Instead of applying the conventional interference power constraint at the primary user (PU) receiver for the secondary user (SU) to protect the primary transmission, we propose a new constraint on the maximum tolerable outage probability for the PU due to the SU transmission. Under the assumption that perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI) on the SU channel, the channel from the SU transmitter to PU receiver, and the PU channel is available at the SU transmitter, we derive the optimal power allocation strategies to achieve the ergodic capacity of the SU fading channel. It is shown by simulations that the proposed power allocation strategies can achieve substantial capacity gain for the SU over that based on the conventional interference power constraint, for the same PU outage probability loss.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199283.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Cognitive Radio Under Primary User's Outage Loss Constraint","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Interference constraints","Fading","Chromium","Radio transmitters","Propagation losses","Protection","Delay","Power control","Capacity planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fading channels","probability","radio links","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power allocation","outage loss constraint","secondary link","spectrum sharing","primary link","fading cognitive radio network","maximum tolerable outage probability","primary user","secondary user","channel state information","ergodic capacity","fading channel","conventional interference power constraint","outage probability loss"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Cognitive Radio Under Primary User's Outage Loss Constraint","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199283/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814736","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Allocation for Cognitive Radio Under Primary User's Outage Loss Constraint","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-35-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08652S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199285,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, using the sum rate as our design metric, we develop a convex optimization problem that provides an extremely tight upper bound on performance.

We obtain energy management policies which minimize a linear combination of the mean queue length and the mean data loss rate. Then, we obtain two easily implementable suboptimal policies and compare their performance to that of the optimal policy. Next, we extend the Throughput Optimal policy developed in our previous work to sensors with two modes. Via this policy, we can increase the throughput substantially and stabilize the data queue by allowing the node to sleep in some slots and to drop some generated packets. This policy requires minimal statistical knowledge of the system.

Based on this framework, specific strategies of optimum power and rate allocation for the coded V-BLAST architecture are obtained and its performance is analyzed. A fractional waterfilling algorithm, which is shown to optimize both the capacity and the outage probability of the coded V-BLAST, is proposed. Compact, closed-form expressions for the optimum allocation of the average power are given. The uniform allocation of average power is shown to be near optimum at moderate to high SNR for the coded V-BLAST with the average rate allocation (when per-stream rates are set to match the per-stream capacity). The results reported also apply to multiuser detection and channel equalization relying on successive interference cancelation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Power and Rate Allocation for Coded V-BLAST","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199297","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199297.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199297","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Capacity planning","Performance analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Interference cancellation","MIMO","Error analysis","Silicon carbide","Feedback","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","codes","interference suppression","multiuser detection","probability","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","rate allocation","coded V-BLAST","coded spatial multiplexing system","fractional waterfilling algorithm","outage probability","multiuser detection","channel equalization","interference cancelation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Power and Rate Allocation for Coded V-BLAST","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199297/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10814868","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Power and Rate Allocation for Coded V-BLAST","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-41-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052286S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199300,"authors":[{"name":"C.

However, due to its exponentially high complexity, many alternative algorithms, including some parallel detection (PD) ones with low complexity and high stability, have been proposed instead for practical applications. Nevertheless, the existing PD algorithms are unable to exploit sufficiently the diversity order increment for low-complexity algorithms via exhaustive interference cancellation (EIC) and the complexity of the sub-detectors is still undesirably high. In this paper, a novel PD algorithm with relative low-complexity sub-detectors, i.e., the selective-interference-cancellation sub-detectors, has been developed. The algorithm is abbreviated as PDSIC algorithm. Numerical analysis indicates that the PDSIC algorithm can achieve the near-optimal performance with much lower complexity in comparison with the existing PD algorithms. Thus, the PDSIC algorithm makes the parallel detection more feasible in practical systems with limited parallel processing elements.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199300.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Detection Algorithm with Selective Interference Cancellation for V-BLAST Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Interference cancellation","Transmitting antennas","Numerical analysis","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Peer to peer computing","Communications Society","Paper technology","Space technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","interference suppression","maximum likelihood detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel detection algorithm","selective interference cancellation","V-BLAST systems","maximum-likelihood detection","vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time systems","parallel detection","diversity order increment","exhaustive interference cancellation","PD algorithm","PDSIC algorithm","parallel processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Detection Algorithm with Selective Interference Cancellation for V-BLAST Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199300/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199300/","accessionNumber":"10815228","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Detection Algorithm with Selective Interference Cancellation for V-BLAST Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-21-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08501S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199302,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, MUI-free transmission is guaranteed only when the data length D, channel delay L, and ZCZ length Z satisfy Z + 1 ges D + L, and the user population is constraint to be K les [N/(Z+1)], where N is the code length. In this paper, for the purpose of allowing higher bandwidth efficiency for more active users, we propose an iterative partial multiuser detector for CS-CDMA/CP with M-ZCZ code to allow Z + 1 < D + L. Because the detector is implemented in the symbol-level (after despreading) and only a partion of users are jointly considered, its receiver complexity is expected to be acceptable for a mobile terminal. Comparison with the DS-CDMA system employing chip-equalization receiver shows that the CS-CDMA/CP system employing the proposed receiver offers a better tradeoff between the performance and receiver complexity, which indicates its potential application in future wireless communications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Multiuser Detection for CS-CDMA/CP over Multipath Channels and Its Comparison with DS-CDMA","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199302","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199302.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Partial Multiuser Detection for CS-CDMA/CP over Multipath Channels and Its Comparison with DS-CDMA","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199302/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815234","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Multiuser Detection for CS-CDMA/CP over Multipath Channels and Its Comparison with DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-19-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057553S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199303,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Our main contribution is a set of new statistical results for the maximum eigenvalue of the random multi-keyhole channel matrix, which includes closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function and probability density function, as well as asymptotic expansions. Based on the results, we analyze the outage performance of the optimal joint beamforming system in multi-keyhole MIMO channels. Our results illustrate that the outage performance of the multi-keyhole channels is generally worse than that of rich-scattering MIMO Rayleigh channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199313","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199313.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Optimal Joint Beamforming in Multi-Keyhole MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Optimal Joint Beamforming in Multi-Keyhole MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199313/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815236","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199313/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Optimal Joint Beamforming in Multi-Keyhole MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-17-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084112S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199315,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this paper, first the decision error rate is computed for the known channel tracking error and then the channel tracking error is evaluated for the known decision error rate.

Aiming to its simplicity, the SNR-assisted XT estimation, has been recognized in ITU as a backward compatible method that does not require any change in the very high speed digital subscriber line 2 (VDSL2) standard. This low complex algorithm can be used for XT channel estimation in dynamic spectrum management (DSM) techniques today. The algorithm as proposed, relies on sending perturbing signals on the victim lines (VLs) and reporting the SNRs by those lines to acquire the crosstalk channel from some disturber line (DL) to the VLs. We generalize this concept to include full startup, tracking and joining scenarios as well as the impact of different perturbation signal choices. Simulation results reveal that starting from no crosstalk precompensation, and updating a precoder matrix based on the DS crosstalk channel estimates, the far-end crosstalk (FEXT) free SNR can be reached in few iterations (36 SNR measurements for the four lines case).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199317.pdf","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio Assisted Crosstalk Channel Estimation for DSL Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199317","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio Assisted Crosstalk Channel Estimation for DSL Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199317/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10815615","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199317/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio Assisted Crosstalk Channel Estimation for DSL Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-16-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083138S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199318,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this context, this paper proposes a general approach for analyzing the performance of dual-hop cooperative diversity networks with nonregenerative variable-gain relays. Such a strategy allows for the use of both equal-gain combining (EGC) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) techniques at the destination. In our analysis, closed-form approximations for the outage probability (OP) and average symbol error rate (SER) of linear modulations are presented. These expressions yield results instantaneously, regardless the number of relays used, in contrast with exact solutions which are rather intricate and difficult to evaluate, especially when the number of relays increases. The inherent simplicity of our methodology makes it attractive to serve as a benchmark in the design and performance evaluation of cooperative networks with variable-gain relays and employing either EGC or MRC. Numerical results are provided and compared with Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed expressions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Performance analysis","Relays","Wireless networks","Error analysis","Fading","Collaboration","Cultural differences","Diversity methods","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","approximation theory","diversity reception","radio networks","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward analysis","wireless networks","transmission reliability","multiple antennas","dual-hop cooperative diversity networks","equal-gain combining technique","maximal-ratio combining technique","closed-form approximations","outage probability","average symbol error rate","linear modulations","cooperative networks performance evaluation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199330","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199330.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Cooperative Diversity Networks: Analysis of Amplify-and-Forward Relaying under Equal-Gain and Maximal-Ratio Combining","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Cooperative Diversity Networks: Analysis of Amplify-and-Forward Relaying under Equal-Gain and Maximal-Ratio Combining","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199330/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199330/","accessionNumber":"10815024","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Cooperative Diversity Networks: Analysis of Amplify-and-Forward Relaying under Equal-Gain and Maximal-Ratio Combining","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-39-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043636S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5199337,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In a typical communications system a cryptographic application is run at a layer above the physical layer and assumes the channel is error free. However, in any real application the channels for friendly users and passive eavesdroppers are not error free and Wyner's wiretap model addresses this scenario. Using this model, we show the security of a common cryptographic primitive, i.e. a keystream generator based on linear feedback shift registers (LFSR), can be strengthened by exploiting properties of the physical layer. A passive eavesdropper can be made to experience greater difficulty in cracking an LFSR- based cryptographic system insomuch that the computational complexity of discovering the secret key increases by orders of magnitude, or is altogether infeasible. This result is shown for two fast correlation attacks originally presented by Meier and Staffelbach, in the context of channel errors due to the wiretap channel model.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199337","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199337.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical-Layer Security: Combining Error Control Coding and Cryptography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Physical-Layer Security: Combining Error Control Coding and Cryptography","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199337/","accessionNumber":"10815248","publicationDate":"June 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical-Layer Security: Combining Error Control Coding and Cryptography","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-11-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08666S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199338,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Since the simple RN in this system is unaware of the structure of its received signal and incapable of performing complicated signal processing, the interim channels over the SN-RN and the RN-DN hops can not be estimated directly. Therefore, we develop a novel interim channel estimation approach in this paper. Furthermore, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the pilot amplifying matrix sequence at the RN to ensure successful interim channel estimation at the DN, and present rules to design low-complexity pilot amplifying matrices meeting these conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Matrix Design for Interim Channel Estimation in Two-Hop MIMO AF Relay Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Relays","Tin","Signal processing","Peer to peer computing","Power system relaying","Sufficient conditions","Channel state information","USA Councils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","matrix algebra","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interim channel estimation","two-hop MIMO AF relay systems","two-hop multiinput-multi-output relay system","two-hop amplify-and-forward relay system","source node","relay node","destination node","complicated signal processing","pilot amplifying matrix sequence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Matrix Design for Interim Channel Estimation in Two-Hop MIMO AF Relay Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199340/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815488","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Matrix Design for Interim Channel Estimation in Two-Hop MIMO AF Relay Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-08-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112434S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199343,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Using beamformer in both transmit and receive sides is an approach to mitigate the CSI. In the MIMO systems employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique, frequency domain or time domain beamforming can be used. In this paper, we propose a new time domain broadband beamforming (TBBF) for MIMO-OFDM systems based on a SVD type of block circular channel matrix. TBBF is attained by polynomial eigen-beamformer when the right and the left polynomial eigenvectors are utilized at the transmitter and the receiver sides, respectively. The new proposed TBBF is able to completely mitigate the CSI due to shaping the multiple beams in orthogonal directions. Performance of the proposed polynomial eigen-based TBBF is evaluated by computer simulations and compared with the previously proposed TBBF scheme based on the SBR2 algorithm. The results show that the proposed time domain beamforming method outperforms the SBR2-based scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199343","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199343.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial Eigen-Beamformer in Time Domain for MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial Eigen-Beamformer in Time Domain for MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199343/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814884","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199343/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial Eigen-Beamformer in Time Domain for MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-06-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035382S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199346,"authors":[{"name":"C.

However, an efficient transmission scheme and resource management are required to exploit these advantages. Specifically, low-complexity adaptive schemes and power control strategies should be designed, thereby achieving robust and cost-efficient e2e communications. In this paper an adaptive transmission scheme is presented, where one relay stops forwarding the message if it is in outage and other nodes adapt to a new space-time code. For this adaptive scheme, optimal as well as sub-optimal closed-form power allocation solutions are derived which minimize the total transmission power while satisfying a given e2e outage probability. The significant power savings due to the proposed approaches in comparison to a non-adaptive scheme is demonstrated by numerical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199351.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocations for Adaptive Distributed MIMO Multi-Hop Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Spread spectrum communication","Relays","Space time codes","Space technology","Resource management","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Power control","Robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","power control","space-time codes","telecommunication network management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive distributed MIMO multihop network","end-to-end user experience","multihop relaying","distributed low complexity space-time code","path losses","wireless channel","resource management","power control strategies","adaptive transmission scheme","suboptimal closed-form power allocation","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocations for Adaptive Distributed MIMO Multi-Hop Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199351/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815028","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocations for Adaptive Distributed MIMO Multi-Hop Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-08-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.148293S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199353,"authors":[{"name":"C.-H.

Different from conventional cooperative spectrum sensing schemes that assume synchronous local sensing information, our scheme enables combination of both synchronous and asynchronous sensing information by utilizing the statistics of licensed band occupancy. In our scheme, the amount of information from each CR user is flexible and a simplified implementation is also feasible under a symmetrical case.

The interference-power constraint at the PR receiver is usually one of the following two types: average interference power (AIP) constraint that regulates the average power level over different fading states and peak interference power (PIP) constraint that limits the peak power level at each fading state. From CR's perspective, AIP constraint is more favorable than PIP constraint because of its more flexibility for dynamic power allocations. On the contrary, from the perspective of protecting the PR, the more restrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option. Some surprisingly, this paper shows that in terms of various forms of capacity limits achievable for the PR fading channel, namely, ergodic and outage capacities, AIP constraint is also superior over PIP constraint. This result is based upon an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, i.e., variable interference power levels at the PR receiver in the AIP case are more advantageous over constant ones in the PIP case for minimizing the resulted PR capacity losses. Therefore, AIP constraint leads to larger fading channel capacities over PIP constraint for both CR and PR transmissions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199373/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10815148","publicationDate":"June 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199373/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Protecting Primary Users in Cognitive Radio Networks: Peak or Average Interference Power Constraint?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protecting Primary Users in Cognitive Radio Networks: Peak or Average Interference Power Constraint?","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-07-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073252S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199380,"authors":[{"name":"X.

However, unlike the zero-interference ZF, the optimal power allocation issue using CIR is a nonconvex optimization problem which will become more intractable with nonconvex QoS constraints. In this paper we focus on the challenging QoS-aware optimal power allocation problem, aiming to maximize the system sum rate and guarantee the users' minimum data rates. As a result, an \"Iterative Geometric Programming\" (IGP) strategy is proposed which transforms the underlying problem to a series of tractable Geometric Programming (GP) problems through an iterative convex approximation. Extensive simulations have been conducted and the results indicate that IGP is quite suitable to tackle the problem, which can achieve a good balance between the system sum rate and the individual QoS requirements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199380","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199380.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Optimal Power Allocation with Channel Inversion Regularization Precoding in MU-MIMO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware Optimal Power Allocation with Channel Inversion Regularization Precoding in MU-MIMO","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199380/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815151","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199380/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware Optimal Power Allocation with Channel Inversion Regularization Precoding in MU-MIMO","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-01-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04195S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199387,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Our analysis shows that, in terms of mean energy consumed, there is an optimal number of coded data packets to send before stopping to listen. This number depends on the energy needed to transmit each coded packet and the acknowledgment (ACK), probabilities of packet and ACK erasure, and the number of degrees of freedom that the receiver requires to decode the data. We show that its energy performance is superior to that of a full-duplex system. We also study the performance of our scheme when the number of coded packets is chosen to minimize the mean time to complete transmission as in.

The CA provides practically the same performance as the LLL algorithm while having a considerably lower complexity, especially for MIMO systems with a large number of transmit and receive antennas. The algorithm has been implemented in real-time using a rapid prototyping methodology, greatly reducing its development time. Implementation results indicate that the variable complexity and the sequential nature of LR algorithms, like the CA, remain their main drawbacks from an implementation point of view.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199388","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199388.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid Prototyping of Clarkson's Lattice Reduction for MIMO Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199388/","displayDocTitle":"Rapid Prototyping of Clarkson's Lattice Reduction for MIMO Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815649","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199388/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid Prototyping of Clarkson's Lattice Reduction for MIMO Detection","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-06-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125184S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5199389,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Each source transmits over an orthogonal channel by using cooperative broadcasting. Each destination is required to receive and decode a given amount of information. A destination can receive different partitions of information from multiple sources. The sources cooperate and allocate the flow rates along each link to minimize the maximum individual transmit power of each source. To simplify the computations involved in the optimization process, we suggest a sub-optimal algorithm. Simulation results indicate that our optimal scheme gives improvements between 4.2 dB and 5.6 dB over the single-source scheme, where a destination selects only one source for transmission, in our considered networks and rate requirements. Our sub-optimal algorithm suffers a loss of below 0.4 dB compared with the optimal one. The expressions involved in the sub-optimal algorithm are less complicated and it requires M iterations, where M is the number of destinations, and a bisection search in each iteration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199389/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815158","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rate Allocation for the Multi-Source Downlink Channel with Minimax Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Allocation for the Multi-Source Downlink Channel with Minimax Optimization","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-17-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047211S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199391,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The adaptation policies are obtained by maximizing the achievable capacity under said constraint and bit error rate (BER) requirements in multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM).

The heterogeneity of both spectrum availability and traffic demand among secondary users has brought significant challenge for efficient spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks. Observing that spectrum resource can be better matched to traffic demand of secondary users with the help of relay nodes, in this paper we propose to utilize cooperative relays to assist the transmission and improve spectrum efficiency. Different from traditional cooperative communication within a single channel, in our scheme a relay node may be selected for a link to bridge the link's source and destination using its different common channels with those two nodes. With these new logical links composed of both direct link and relay link, new routing protocols are needed so that end-to-end performance can be better improved. Therefore, we define a new link cost, relay- aware link cost, which considers several aspects including channel availability, channel condition, channel utilization and potential relays. Based on this link cost, a relay-assisted routing (RAR) protocol is proposed which includes routing discovery and local adjustment. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed routing scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10815393","htmlLink":"/document/5199406/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Relay-Assisted Routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-Assisted Routing in Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"01-07-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046726S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199408,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Such links might be used for high-speed communication between buildings or towers. For practical reasons, the aperture sizes of the transmit (TX) and receive (RX) arrays may be limited, which tends to make the rank of the long-distance MIMO channel matrix close to unity. The paper shows that the addition of just one repeater can bring the channel to full rank, approximately doubling the capacity of the link. Typical values of repeater isolation are assumed. For small TX and RX array element spacings, there is considerable robustness in optimal repeater location. Even with some multipath, most of the capacity improvement is retained.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199408","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199408.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Repeater-Assisted Capacity Enhancement (RACE) for MIMO Links in a Line-of-Sight Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199408/","displayDocTitle":"Repeater-Assisted Capacity Enhancement (RACE) for MIMO Links in a Line-of-Sight Environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815394","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199408/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeater-Assisted Capacity Enhancement (RACE) for MIMO Links in a Line-of-Sight Environment","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-21-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060828S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199412,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this context, the dominant issues are providing high-throughput, and reliability in the sense of not losing samples due to buffer overflow at the wireless devices. A random medium access control (MAC) scheme, such as the IEEE 802.15.4, is unlikely to perform well along those metrics. CSMA/CA, the foundation of IEEE 802.15.4, is inefficient at the high-throughput regime. The polling mode of IEEE 802.15.4, on the other hand, ignores the buffer constraints, thereby increasing the risk of buffer overflow. In this paper, we propose SAMPLER, a scheduled MAC protocol that is optimal, in the sense of minimizing sample losses while maximizing throughput, in the typical scenario where a sophisticated access point forms a star topology with the wireless sensors. We describe SAMPLER, its properties and demonstrate its superior performance compared to random-access MAC through simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Wireless sensor networks","Buffer overflow","Media Access Protocol","Electrical equipment industry","Industrial control","Manufacturing industries","Quality control","Flexible manufacturing systems","Jet engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","measurement systems","radio equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAMPLER","optimal MAC algorithm","wireless instrumentation systems","wireless devices","industrial instrumentation","quality control","jet engine manufacture","dominant issues","buffer overflow","random medium access control","IEEE 802.15.4","CSMA/CA","polling mode","buffer constraint","scheduled MAC protocol","access point","star topology","wireless sensors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199432","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199432.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAMPLER: An Optimal MAC Algorithm for Wireless Instrumentation Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SAMPLER: An Optimal MAC Algorithm for Wireless Instrumentation Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199432/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199432/","accessionNumber":"10814785","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAMPLER: An Optimal MAC Algorithm for Wireless Instrumentation Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-22-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048265S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":5199440,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In advantage-based methods, high channel quality in an average or opportunistic sense is exploited between two legitimate nodes, such that nonzero secrecy capacity can be achieved. Since such methods require bounds on the quality of the eavesdropper channel, they are somewhat impractical. Secret key generation based on tracking channel evolution in time division duplex systems is a more attractive option, where two nodes generate secret key bits based on a mutually known random channel. Since the eavesdropper channel is typically independent of the legitimate channel, the key can only be broken by brute force attacks, which are difficult when new keys are continuously generated. In this paper, the information theoretic limits of key generation schemes are investigated, based on the level of estimation error, temporal correlation, and dependence of the eavesdropper and legitimate channels. Three practical candidate key generation schemes are also considered: channel quantization and channel quantization with guardband.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199440.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Physical Layer Key Generation Schemes: Performance and Information Theoretic Limits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Physical layer","Peer to peer computing","Communication system security","Estimation error","Quantization","Fading","Wireless communication","Fluctuations","Information analysis","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","quantisation (signal)","radio networks","telecommunication security","time division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical layer key generation schemes","performance limits","information theoretic limits","wireless security methods","physical propagation channel","advantage-based methods","channel quality","nonzero secrecy capacity","eavesdropper channel","secret key generation","tracking channel evolution","time division duplex systems","channel quantization","guardband"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Secure Physical Layer Key Generation Schemes: Performance and Information Theoretic Limits","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199440/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814786","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Physical Layer Key Generation Schemes: Performance and Information Theoretic Limits","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-14-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061057S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199444,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As a result, there are two types of security in communications, securing user data and securing the physical network. The first is addressed with encryption algorithms, the unbreakability of which does not depends so much on the sophistication of the algorithm but on the difficulty to break it using a sequential computer; that is, it capitalizes on the inability of the attacker to use a fast supercomputer. The second is not a well addressed topic, particularly in modern fiber-optic networks. One attempt to create an unbreakable cipher-text is quantum cryptography that emanated from quantum mechanics; this method capitalizes on the no-cloning principle of particular characteristics of photons, such as polarization. In this paper, we examine the security of advanced optical networks, fiber-optic and free space optical (FSO). We describe quantum cryptography and the quantum key distribution, including the principle of teleportation, we identify vulnerabilities and we discuss detection mechanisms and countermeasure strategies against attacks on the physical network.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199444","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199444.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security in Advanced Optical Communication Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Security in Advanced Optical Communication Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199444/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814672","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199444/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security in Advanced Optical Communication Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-10-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048601S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199446,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We focus on the so-called transparent amplify-and-forward (T-AaF) for MIMO relay channels, in which the relay requires neither channel state information (CSI) nor synchronization of symbols or carrier. Specifically, we propose and analyze new selection schemes where the relay, based on the received signal energies, select the \"best\" received signals on the S rarr R hop and retransmits them to the destination terminal with either repetitive or selective transmission. Through the derivation of pairwise error probability (PEP) expressions and asymptotic order of diversity (AOD) analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed selection schemes maintain full diversity order. Furthermore, we show that selective transmission on R rarr D hop has better performance, better throughput, and significantly better energy efficiency than repetitive transmission.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199446","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selection Cooperation with Transparent Amplify-and-Forward Relaying in MIMO Relay Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selection Cooperation with Transparent Amplify-and-Forward Relaying in MIMO Relay Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199446/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815409","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199446/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selection Cooperation with Transparent Amplify-and-Forward Relaying in MIMO Relay Channels","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-15-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054271S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199447,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed technique outperforms conventional CI by exploiting some of the consequential inter- channel interference (ICI). It achieves this by applying partial channel inversion such that the constructive part of ICI is preserved and exploited while the destructive part is eliminated by means of CI precoding. By doing so, the effective signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) delivered to the mobile unit (MU) receivers is enhanced, without the need to invest in additional transmitted signal power at the MIMO base station (BS). The trade-off to this achievement is a minor increase in the complexity of the BS processing. The presented theoretical analysis and simulations show that due to the SINR enhancement, significant performance gains are offered by the proposed MIMO precoding technique compared to its conventional counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199447","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199447.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective Channel Inversion Precoding for the Downlink of MIMO Wireless Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selective Channel Inversion Precoding for the Downlink of MIMO Wireless Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199447/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815294","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199447/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Channel Inversion Precoding for the Downlink of MIMO Wireless Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-07-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048154S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199451,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This work addresses the extraction and exploitation of RF \"fingerprints\" to classify emissions and provide device-specific identification. Burst transient detection precedes RF fingerprint extraction and is generally the most critical step in the overall process. This work provides a much needed sensitivity analysis of burst detection capability. The analysis is conducted using instantaneous amplitude responses with both Fractal-Bayesian Step Change Detection (Fractal-BSCD) and Variance Trajectory (VT) processes. The performance of each method is evaluated under varying SNR conditions using experimentally collected 802.11a OFDM signals. The impact of transient detection error on signal classification performance is then demonstrated using RF fingerprints and Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) with Maximum Likelihood (ML) classification. The VT technique emerges as the better alternative for all SNRs considered and yields MDA-ML classification accuracy that is consistent with \"perfect\" transient estimation performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity Analysis of Burst Detection and RF Fingerprinting Classification Performance","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199451","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199451.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity Analysis of Burst Detection and RF Fingerprinting Classification Performance","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199451/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815061","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity Analysis of Burst Detection and RF Fingerprinting Classification Performance","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"02-03-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047165S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199457,"authors":[{"name":"W.

For mobile applications, e.g., from a ground base station to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the FSO channel can suffer from severe instantaneous misalignment. This time varying misalignment is unknown to the transmitter and causes data packet corruption and erasure. As a result, the application of traditional fixed-rate erasure coding techniques is difficult. In this paper, we consider the application of rateless Raptor codes for such mobile FSO channels. Due to the high data rates required, short-length (16-1024) Raptor codes are designed and simulated on a severe jitter FSO channel. A key advantage of Raptor codes is their independence on channel state, no matter how large the misalignment. With a 1 Gbps transmitter, the designed Raptor code with k = 64 message packets offers 560 Mbps data rate and decoding cost of 4.14 operations per packet when transmitting power is 20 dBm.

Specifically, it is assumed that either a QAM or a Complex Gaussian finite-length symbol is transmitted in a noisy, peak-limited channel with known peak power. The goal is determine the whether an uninformed receiver can distinguish between these signal types using an average power statistic. Several methods for transmitting through peak-power channels are examined including optimal clipping and piecewise linear scaling (PWLS) with selected mapping (SLM) PAR reduction. For the analysis, it is necessary to derive the mean power for each of the transmission methods. Accordingly, we show how the harmonic mean PAR, E[1/PAR], is related to the mean power and derive E[1/PAR] in closed form. We find that average power is a accurate discriminator for low-order QAM and Gaussian symbols. For high-order QAM, accurate discrimination is also possible when the noise level is sufficiently low or when enough signal samples are available.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199458","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199458.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Classification Using a Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Statistic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199458/","displayDocTitle":"Signal Classification Using a Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Statistic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814929","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199458/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Classification Using a Peak-to-Average Power Ratio Statistic","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-16-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066651S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199459,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The significant capacity gain of adaptive OFDMA comes from fast adaptation of resource allocation in response to instantaneous channel conditions. Despite years of efforts to improve the practicality of adaptive OFDMA, such promising technique is still far from real implementation due to the prohibitively high computational complexity and excessive control overhead. This paper is an endeavor to address the problem by proposing a slow adaptation scheme, where resource allocation is adapted on a much slower time scale than the fluctuation of wireless channel fading. Specifically, the slow adaptive OFDMA is formulated into a stochastic programming problem, which adapts resource allocation according to the channel statistics within an adaptation window rather than according to instantaneous channel conditions. By tuning the length of the adaptation window, we could engineer a desirable tradeoff between spectral efficiency and computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be modified to accommodate inelastic traffics. The modification, referred to as \"safe\" slow adaptation, ensures worst-case data rates to all users. In this work, safe slow adaptation is formulated into a conic linear program, which is efficiently solved via interior-point methods. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed schemes drastically reduce the computational complexity and control overheads, while achieving satisfactorily high spectral efficiency and QoS provisioning as their fast-adaptation counterpart does with a much higher cost.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199464","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199464.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow Adaptive OFDMA via Stochastic Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199464/","displayDocTitle":"Slow Adaptive OFDMA via Stochastic Programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815418","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199464/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow Adaptive OFDMA via Stochastic Programming","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-12-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079667S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5199465,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Keeping in view such a scenario, we propose in this paper the application of a proposed low complexity match filter (MF) based detector for spatial interference cancellation in the presence of one strong interferer. We derive an analytical upper bound for the coded pair wise error probability (PEP) for the proposed MF based detector using the moment generating function (MGF) based method and prove that this detector not only recuperates the diversity order lost by MMSE but also exhibits a coding gain as the interference gets stronger. We also study in this paper the effect of non Gaussian interference on coded PEP of MMSE linear detection and demonstrate the deficit of one order of diversity and a coding loss as the interference gets stronger. Our analysis provides insights to explain the relative performance of MMSE and proposed MF based detectors as a function of the strength of interference. Finally we demonstrate the strength of our new analytical PEP upper bounds by simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Interference Cancellation and Pairwise Error Probability Analysis","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199471","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199471.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Interference Cancellation and Pairwise Error Probability Analysis","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199471/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814799","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Interference Cancellation and Pairwise Error Probability Analysis","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-40-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062237S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199473,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The analysis of several aspects of DSA systems, e.g., cooperative sensing, requires good spatial models of spectrum usage. However, only very focused models such as propagation or shadowing correlation models exist. In this paper we apply techniques developed by the spatial statistics community to the modelling of spectrum. In more detail, we use random fields and the semivariogram to describe the spatial correlation of spectrum usage. We extract parameters from extensive real-life measurements for multiple wireless technologies. These parameter sets enable other researchers to use the model for different tasks ranging from theoretical to simulation-based studies.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199473.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Statistics of Spectrum Usage: From Measurements to Spectrum Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199473/","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Statistics of Spectrum Usage: From Measurements to Spectrum Models","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815532","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Statistics of Spectrum Usage: From Measurements to Spectrum Models","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"08-06-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087368S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5199475,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In addition, noisy measurements are modeled through the Basis Pursuit DeNoise formulation, which enables to reconstruct the time-frequency representation with some errors or information losses.

Optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detection is overly complex due to the presence of substantial intercarrier interference (ICI). Consequently, we investigate an alternative detection mechanism based on the generalized sphere decoding (GSD) algorithm. We examine the bandwidth efficiency and the error performance in additive white gaussian noise (AWGN), for various FDM signal parameters. In particular, we show that it is possible to detect optimally and efficiently FDM signals, with 25% bandwidth gain with respect to analogous OFDM signals. This indicates that the transmission of spectrally efficient non orthogonal FDM signals is tangible.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199477","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199477.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrally Efficient FDM Signals: Bandwidth Gain at the Expense of Receiver Complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectrally Efficient FDM Signals: Bandwidth Gain at the Expense of Receiver Complexity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199477/","publicationDate":"June 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10815423","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199477/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrally Efficient FDM Signals: Bandwidth Gain at the Expense of Receiver Complexity","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-18-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09822S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5199479,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In this paper, we explore the spectrum handoff procedure and then propose four metrics to characterize both short-term and long-term spectrum handoff performance: link maintenance probability, the number of spectrum handoff, switching delay, and non-completion probability. In particular, the probability mass function (pmf) and the average number of spectrum handoff are developed. The tele-traffic parameters are relaxed to follow a general distribution function, which will enable a wide applicability and theoretical significance of the derived formulae. Both opportunistic and negotiated spectrum access strategies are investigated. Results show that these two mechanisms will generate significantly different performance. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance trade-off and the interaction between the primary users and the secondary users. The impact of key parameters on spectrum handoff is also discussed. The techniques as well as the results are important for evaluating the primary and second users co-existence, and hence helpful for design and optimization of cognitive radio networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199479","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Handoff in Cognitive Radio Networks: Opportunistic and Negotiated Situations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Handoff in Cognitive Radio Networks: Opportunistic and Negotiated Situations","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199479/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815068","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199479/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Handoff in Cognitive Radio Networks: Opportunistic and Negotiated Situations","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-10-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094338S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5199481,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Interference minimization requires cognitive radio receivers to be able to detect the presence of all other systems competing for spectrum usage, a process often termed \"spectrum sensing\". This paper focuses on the kernel function of spectrum sensing: blind interference detection from a single, strictly time-limited, received data vector. Recent research has identified shortcomings in the operation of classical blind interference detection techniques such as energy detection and radiometry. This paper demonstrates that implicit interference characteristics can be exploited in a formal framework using hidden Markov modeling to produce a spectrum sensor with a receiver operating characteristic which is improved on that of energy detection and several other previously reported methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199481","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199481.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Sensing Using Hidden Markov Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sensing Using Hidden Markov Modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199481/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814800","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199481/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sensing Using Hidden Markov Modeling","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"08-05-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08474S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199483,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In addition, we analyze the optimized QAMs through the use of an extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart for iterative decoding.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal analysis","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Lattices","Constellation diagram","Information analysis","Iterative decoding","Signal design","Energy efficiency","Communications Society","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","multidimensional signal processing","optimisation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multidimensional QAM signaling","sphere packing optimization","extrinsic information transfer","EXIT chart analysis","sphere detection","optimized constellations","squared minimum distance","iterative decoding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199484","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199484.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sphere Packing Optimization and EXIT Chart Analysis for Multi-Dimensional QAM Signaling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sphere Packing Optimization and EXIT Chart Analysis for Multi-Dimensional QAM Signaling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199484/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199484/","accessionNumber":"10815537","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sphere Packing Optimization and EXIT Chart Analysis for Multi-Dimensional QAM Signaling","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-25-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063519S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5199490,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In our paper we obtain the steady-state Kalman gain to estimate the channel state thus eliminating a larger portion of the calculation burden. Steady- state value is calculated by transforming the vector Kalman filtering in to scalar domain by exploiting the filter characteristics when pilot subcarriers are used for channel estimation. Kalman filters operate optimally in the steady-state condition. Therefore by avoiding the convergence period of the Kalman gain, the proposed scheme is able to perform better than the conventional method. Also, driving noise variance of the channel is difficult to obtain practical situations and accurate knowledge is important for the proper operation of the Kalman filter. Thus we extend our scheme to operate in the absence of the knowledge of driving noise variance by utilizing received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results show considerable estimator performance gain can be obtained compared to the conventional Kalman filter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Steady-State Kalman Filtering for Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems Utilizing SNR","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199491","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199491.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Steady-State Kalman Filtering for Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems Utilizing SNR","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199491/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814683","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Steady-State Kalman Filtering for Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems Utilizing SNR","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-10-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054131S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5199493,"authors":[{"name":"G.

By the subband processing, MRC design based on eigenfiltering which is widely used in frequency flat environments could be applied to frequency selective channels, but the efficient synthesis of output signal through the inverse DFT (discrete Fourier transform) is disturbed by the nonuniqueness of eigenvectors. In the proposed method, a two-step approach is adopted to solve this problem: in the first step, we use simple compensation of weight uncertainty with short (or possibly no) pilot signal and derive a hard-decision temporary output. Then in the second step, the output data is used as a training sequence to determine optimum compensation. It is shown through computer simulations that the proposed scheme improves the transmission rate of SBAA scheme keeping good performance, and some fundamental features are also investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199494/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814685","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Subband Adaptive Array with Reduced Pilot Signal Using Maximal Ratio Combining Scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband Adaptive Array with Reduced Pilot Signal Using Maximal Ratio Combining Scheme","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-05-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057194S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5199495,"authors":[{"name":"B.

First, the problem is formulated as an optimization problem with prohibitive complexity. Second, by analyzing the optimal solution for the subcarrier allocation problem without PF constraint, two suboptimal schemes are proposed. The simulation results indicate that with the same fairness performance, the proposed schemes achieve considerable capacity gain compared with the conventional PF scheduling method which is extended simply from the single-hop system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199495.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier Allocation for OFDMA Relay Networks with Proportional Fair Constraint","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Wireless communication","Spread spectrum communication","Resource management","Fading","Research and development","Frequency conversion","OFDM","Broadcasting","Communications Society"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier allocation","OFDMA relay networks","proportional fair constraint","multihop orthogonal frequency division multiple-access","broadcast networks","amplify-and-forward","system transmission rate","optimization problem","proportional fair scheduling method","single-hop system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier Allocation for OFDMA Relay Networks with Proportional Fair Constraint","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199495/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815539","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier Allocation for OFDMA Relay Networks with Proportional Fair Constraint","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-06-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.77759S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199497,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We consider the case where the multiple transmit antennas are used to deliver independent data streams to multiple users via a multi-user technique known as vector perturbation. We derive expressions for the capacity in terms of the average energy of the preceded vector, and use this to derive a closed-form high-SNR upper bound, which we show to be tight via simulation. We then turn to the practical issue of user selection. We propose a low-complexity user selection algorithm that attempts to maximize the high-SNR sum rate upper bound. Simulations show that the algorithm outperforms other user selection algorithms of similar complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199498.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum Rates and User Scheduling for Multi-User MIMO Vector Perturbation Precoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Vectors","Upper bound","Transmitting antennas","Lattices","Downlink","Communications Society","Laboratories","Rayleigh channels","Broadcast technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel capacity","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","Rayleigh channels","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO vector perturbation","precoding","sum rates","user scheduling","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output","Rayleigh fading broadcast channel","multiple transmit antennas","vector perturbation","low-complexity user selection algorithm","SNR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sum Rates and User Scheduling for Multi-User MIMO Vector Perturbation Precoding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199498/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814811","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum Rates and User Scheduling for Multi-User MIMO Vector Perturbation Precoding","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-03-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061024S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199503,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The structure of the proposed receiver is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The conventional SVD method is able to eliminate the co-space interference (CSI) in single user scenario, however, due to multi-channel environment, it is not able to eliminate the co-space interferences caused by the transmitted signals to the other users that is called multiuser interference (MUI). By combining the SVD and space frequency spreading code, a receiver called total interference cancellation (TIC) is developed that completely eliminates both the CSI and the MUI. The performance of the TIC suffers from small singular values of the subchannel matrices. To improve the performance, a symbol-chip level MMSE receiver is developed in which joint equalization and beamforming is utilized at chip level when the MMSE criterion is employed at symbol level (after despreading). The performance of the proposed receiver is evaluated and compared under different scenarios by computer simulations. The results show that there is no error floor in the bit error rate (BER) performances of the SVD based receiver under both criteria in the multiuser environment. Compared with the TIC criterion, the receiver designed based on the symbol-chip level MMSE criterion significantly improves the BER performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199503.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SVD-Based Receiver for Downlink MIMO MC-CDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Interference elimination","Bit error rate","Multiaccess communication","Transmitters","Singular value decomposition","Frequency","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","radio receivers","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SVD-based receiver","downlink MIMO system","MC-CDMA system","multicarrier code-division multiple-access","multiple-input multiple-output system","singular value decomposition","cospace interference","multiuser interference","space frequency spreading code","total interference cancellation","symbol-chip level MMSE receiver","bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"SVD-Based Receiver for Downlink MIMO MC-CDMA Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814950","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SVD-Based Receiver for Downlink MIMO MC-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-09-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046731S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199504,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this context, MIMO wireless system adopting spatial multiplexing offer a way of increasing the spectral efficiency of the system. In order to fully exploit this capacity non linear MIMO detectors such as maximum likelihood detectors are required. However, when high order modulation schemes are applied, the complexity of this kind of detector becomes prohibitive for a practical implementation. As a solution to this problem, low complexity maximum likelihood detectors such as sphere detectors are appealing as a low complexity solution for high spectral efficiency transmission. Although sphere decoding provides a lower complexity solution than a classical ML detector, its complexity still remains unpredictable and exponentially dependent on channel propagation conditions. This variability in complexity makes the implementation of sphere decoders not practical. In this paper, a new approach for constraining the ML search space is proposed which provides a predictable upper bound for complexity, hence facilitating its implementation. Moreover, the new approach for computing the constrained search space significantly reduces the complexity of the detection while offering scalability in terms of performance and complexity. Simulation results in a cellular system demonstrate the scalability of our detector and the performance/complexity trade-off that it enables.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol Based Search Space Constraining for Complexity/Performance Scalable Near ML Detection in Spatial Multiplexing MIMO OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199504","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199504.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199504","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Symbol Based Search Space Constraining for Complexity/Performance Scalable Near ML Detection in Spatial Multiplexing MIMO OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199504/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815433","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol Based Search Space Constraining for Complexity/Performance Scalable Near ML Detection in Spatial Multiplexing MIMO OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-13-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114904S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199510,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Target identification, on the other hand, concerns the estimation of the target's kinematics and attributes. The current practice is often formulated as finding the conditional probability of the target type on features derived from the sensor measurements with statistical pattern recognition.

However, when used in wireless environment, it suffers significant performance degradation. Most of the current research on this issue only focuses on the TFRC protocol itself, ignoring tightly-coupled relation between the transport layer and other network layers. In this paper, we propose a new approach to address this problem, integrating TFRC with application layer and physical layer to form a holistic design for real-time video streaming over wireless multi-hop mesh networks. The goal of the proposed approach is to achieve the best user-perceived video quality by jointly optimizing system parameters residing in different network layers, including the real-time video coding parameters at the application layer, the packet sending rate at the transport layer, and the modulation and coding scheme at the physical layer. The problem is formulated and solved as to find the optimal combination of parameters to minimize the end-to-end expected video distortion constrained by a given video playback delay. Experimental results have validated 2-4 dB PSNR gain achieved by the proposed approach in wireless multi-hop mesh networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199511","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199511.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TFRC-Based Rate Control for Real-Time Video Streaming over Wireless Multi-Hop Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199511/","displayDocTitle":"TFRC-Based Rate Control for Real-Time Video Streaming over Wireless Multi-Hop Mesh Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815091","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199511/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TFRC-Based Rate Control for Real-Time Video Streaming over Wireless Multi-Hop Mesh Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-15-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056494S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199512,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We characterize the distortion exponent of several source and channel coding strategies; that is, we characterize how fast the distortion decays to zero as the SNR increases. Unlike previous works, we consider networks with different received SNR's and with correlated fading. We generalize the definition of distortion exponent to SNR-asymmetric channels. We show that fading correlation degrades the achievable mean-square distortion but does not affect the distortion exponent. The performance degradation is measured in terms of power-offset; that is, the power increment needed to achieve the same performance as the uncorrelated case. We show that the power-offset is proportional to the determinant of the fading correlation matrix. Our proposed methodology allows us to study any number of parallel channels and we are no longer restricted to two channels (as was commonly done in the previous literature). Finally, we show that determining the distortion exponent of multiple description coding (MDC) schemes in high SNR reduces to solving a linear programming problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199512/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815188","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Fading Correlation on Average Source MMSE Distortion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Fading Correlation on Average Source MMSE Distortion","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-05-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095937S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5199515,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, the majority of results in this area has been produced assuming that the fading coefficients of the MIMO subchannels are totally uncorrelated. In this direction, this paper investigates the ergodic per-cell sum-rate capacity of the MIMO Cellular Multiple-Access Channel under correlated fading and multicell processing. More specifically, the current channel model considers Rayleigh fading, uniformly distributed User Terminals (UTs) over a planar cellular system and power-law path loss. Furthermore, both BSs and Uts are equipped with correlated multiple antennas, which are modelled according to the Kronecker model. The per-cell sum-rate capacity closed form is derived using a Free Probability approach and numerical results are produced by varying the cell density of the system, as well as the level of correlation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Multicell Processing Capacity of the Cellular MIMO Uplink Channel under Correlated Fading","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199517","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199517.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Multicell Processing Capacity of the Cellular MIMO Uplink Channel under Correlated Fading","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199517/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815315","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Multicell Processing Capacity of the Cellular MIMO Uplink Channel under Correlated Fading","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-10-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061136S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5199519,"authors":[{"name":"O.

We mainly address two challenges, namely the channel estimation and the single-user decodability issues. For the former, as the channel estimation becomes trickier owing to self-interference, we propose that users project their training signals on orthogonal subspaces to ensure their separability upon reception. For the latter, we suggest that each user uses, among the available antennas only the antenna subset that ensures both peers are not single-user decodable while maximizing their achievable secrecy sum-rate. Thus, unlike the result reported in literature about the two-way single-antenna wire-tap channel, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a positive secrecy rate even when a user is single-user decodable, provided that a sufficient number of transmit antennas be available. Finally, we observe that the proposed scheme, unlike secrecy schemes based on Wyner's degraded wire-tap channel, provides positive secrecy sum-rate even when the eavesdropper's channels incur as little noise as the legitimate users', and maintains the secrecy rate's growth in the high SNR regime, a fact we demonstrate by computer simulations. This makes the proposed scheme a better candidate for high-throughput secrecy applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Two-Way MIMO Wire-Tap Channel","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199519","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199519.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Two-Way MIMO Wire-Tap Channel","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199519/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814692","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Two-Way MIMO Wire-Tap Channel","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-05-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10456S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199522,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Generative models can replace real digital wireless channels to significantly reduce the time and complexity of system simulation. The errors occurring in digital wireless channels are not independent but form clusters or bursts. Generative models have to produce error sequences having similar burst error statistics to those of original error sequences obtained from real digital systems.

However, to assure acceptable QoS for secondary users without interfering with primary users several challenges must be overcome under physical constraints. Because of hardware constraints, secondary users can only sense a limited number of spectrum channels. Therefore a secondary user must wisely select the channels to be sensed to increase it's likelihood for successful data transmission. However if a secondary user takes up a greedy approach and disregards other secondary users in its channel selection, the whole secondary network would suffer in terms of aggregate throughput. Also because of the autonomous nature of secondary users, the search policy must be as decentralized as possible, i.e. secondary users should need almost no information of one another to operate. In this work we propose a search policy for secondary users in a cell based ad-hoc network and evaluate its performance (total primary and secondary throughput) as a function of different system parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199524","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199524.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Analysis of a Randomized Sensing Scheme in Cell-Based Ad-Hoc Cognitive Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Analysis of a Randomized Sensing Scheme in Cell-Based Ad-Hoc Cognitive Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199524/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815102","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199524/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Analysis of a Randomized Sensing Scheme in Cell-Based Ad-Hoc Cognitive Networks","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"08-07-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079085S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199526,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In the offline algorithm, a given target BLER is achieved by adjusting CQI based on ACK/NAK history. By sweeping through different target BLERs, we can find the throughput optimal BLER offline. This algorithm could be used not only to optimize throughput but also to enable fair resource allocation among mobile users in HSDPA. In the online algorithm, the CQI offset is adapted using an estimated short term throughput gradient without specifying a target BLER. An adaptive stepsize mechanism is proposed to track temporal variation of the environment. We investigate convergence behavior of both algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed offline algorithm can achieve the given target BLER with good accuracy. Both algorithms yield up to 30% HSDPA throughput improvement over that with 10% target BLER.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199527.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Optimization in High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Downlink","Multiaccess communication","Resource management","Peer to peer computing","USA Councils","Modulation coding","Error analysis","Stochastic processes","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","packet reservation multiple access","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput optimization","high speed downlink packet access","channel quality indicator","temporal variation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Optimization in High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199527/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814824","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Optimization in High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-03-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074894S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199531,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In the proposed estimator, the received time domain OFDM samples are first divided into groups where noise samples are approximately independent. Initial maximum likelihood (ML) based symbol timing and frequency offset estimates are obtained based on each group and final estimate is then derived by combining the initial estimates. We further simplify the proposed estimator to a practical one which does not require the knowledge of PLC fading profile, noise profile and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). The simulation results show that, under the presence of colored noise, the proposed practical symbol timing estimator achieves performance gain in terms of correct synchronization probability, around 2 dB at SNR=15 dB, and with improved mean square error (MSE) performance, compared to the widely adopted estimator in. With the knowledge of the statistics of colored noise, another algorithm is also proposed to further improve the estimation performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199531","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199531.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time and Frequency Synchronization for Power Line OFDM Systems with Colored Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time and Frequency Synchronization for Power Line OFDM Systems with Colored Noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199531/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814705","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5199531/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time and Frequency Synchronization for Power Line OFDM Systems with Colored Noise","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-03-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078703S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199538,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Second, to meet the rate fairness constraint imposed by different users' diverse traffic demands, we design a fast algorithm to search for the optimal weight factors, and implement the traffic-matching duality scheme to achieve the long-term target PRF and enhanced revenue rate. Third, we provide analytical channel throughput formulas for equal power allocation (EPA) and waterfilling (WF) power allocations schemes, and also evaluate the actual throughput taking into account the traffic random arrival process, limited buffer size, and transmission delay deadline. Simulation results show that the proposed traffic-matching duality scheme can achieve a significantly higher revenue rate than the fixed weight duality scheme which only tries to maximize the revenue rate but does not match the incoming traffic.","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199538","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199538.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic-Matching Revenue-Rate Maximization Scheduling for Downlink OFDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199538/","displayDocTitle":"Traffic-Matching Revenue-Rate Maximization Scheduling for Downlink OFDMA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815200","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199538/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic-Matching Revenue-Rate Maximization Scheduling for Downlink OFDMA","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-38-08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09253S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199539,"authors":[{"name":"C.

We define transmission capacity as the product among the density of transmissions, the transmission rate, and the successful transmission probability (1 minus the outage probability). The primary (PR) network has a higher priority to access the spectrum without particular considerations for the secondary (SR) network, where the SR network limits its interference to the PR network by carefully controlling the density of its transmitters. Assuming that the nodes are distributed according to Poisson point processes and the two networks use different transmission ranges, we quantify the transmission capacities for both of these two networks and discuss their tradeoff based on asymptotic analysis. Our results show that if the PR network permits a small increase of its outage probability, the sum transmission capacity of the two networks (i.e., the overall spectrum efficiency per unit area) will be boosted significantly over that of a single network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Capacities for Overlaid Wireless Ad Hoc Networks with Outage Constraints","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199539","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199539.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Capacities for Overlaid Wireless Ad Hoc Networks with Outage Constraints","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199539/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10814829","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Capacities for Overlaid Wireless Ad Hoc Networks with Outage Constraints","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-04-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.236197S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5199541,"authors":[{"name":"J.

We assume that the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSI) and the transmitter only has partial CSI, namely, the channel covariance information. We first consider MIMO systems over frequency-flat fading channels. We design the optimal linear precoder based on direct maximization of mutual information over the MIMO channels with discrete-constellation inputs. It turns out that the optimal linear precoder is a non-diagonal non-unitary matrix. Then, we consider MIMO systems over frequency selective fading channels via extending our method to MIMO-OFDM systems. To keep reasonable computational complexity of solving the linear precoding matrix, we propose a sub-optimal approach to restrict the precoding matrix as a block-diagonal matrix. This approach has near-optimal performance when we integrate it with a properly chosen interleaver. Numerical examples show that for MIMO systems over frequency flat fading channels, our proposed optimal linear precoder enjoys 6-9 dB gain compared to the same system without linear precoder. For MIMO-OFDM systems, our reduced-complexity sub-optimal linear precoder captures 3-6 dB gain compared to the same system with no precoding. Moreover, for those MIMO systems employing a linear precoder designed based on Gaussian inputs with gap approximation technique for discrete-constellation inputs, significant loss may occur when the signal-to-noise ratio is larger than 0 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Precoding for MIMO Systems with Partial CSI and Discrete-Constellation Inputs","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199543","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199543.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Precoding for MIMO Systems with Partial CSI and Discrete-Constellation Inputs","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199543/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815338","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Precoding for MIMO Systems with Partial CSI and Discrete-Constellation Inputs","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"05-08-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086599S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5199549,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

New techniques using magnetic induction (MI) can solve two of the three problems (dynamic channel condition and large antenna size), but may still cause even higher path loss. In this paper, a complete characterization of the underground MI communication channel is provided. Based on the channel model, the MI waveguide technique for communication is developed in order to reduce the MI path loss.

By considering a MS's coherence time Deltat\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">coh</sub>\n and coherence bandwidth B\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">coh</sub>\n, and exploiting this redundancy in the MS's CSI, the amount of feedback can be tailored to the specific user's profile and greatly decreased. Typically, reducing feedback results in more uncertainty in CSIT and performance degradation. However, in the proposed scheme, the CSIT's deviation from the true channel state is bounded, and thus can provide robust scheduling. Specifically, two BS schemes are suggested that either fix the average BER or the average outage probability regardless of user mobility or delay spread.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Profiling: A Method for Limited Feedback in OFDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199554","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199554.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"User Profiling: A Method for Limited Feedback in OFDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199554/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815209","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Profiling: A Method for Limited Feedback in OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"10-29-03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058989S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199558,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We propose a PA scheme that uses a codebook of quantized PA vectors designed offline and known to the source, relay, and destination. The destination, which has full knowledge of channel side information (CSI), chooses one of the codebook vectors and conveys back to the source and relay. With the limited amount of available feedback, the design of an appropriate codebook is central to PA, which varies depending on the destination's strategy to choose the optimal PA vector. Assuming high received SNR on either link in the relay path, we first derive the optimal PA solutions as the function of channel realizations with two design criteria, maximizing capacity and minimizing error rate. It is found that when there is high received SNR in either the relay path or the direct path, the optimal solutions for both criteria reduce to simple forms. For maximizing capacity, the available power should be equally allocated to each OFDM subcarrier shared by the source and relay; while for minimum error rate, the available power should be allocated such that the received SNRs for all subcarriers at the destination are the same. The findings lead us to the sub-optimal solutions with great complexity reduction. We then present an adaptation of Lloyd's algorithm to construct a codebook to quantize the optimal PA vectors subject to the amount of feedback. Simulations show that a mild to negligible performance loss can be achieved with only a few bits of feedback at different SNR values.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5198563/5198564/05199558.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.2009.5199558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2009.5199558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5198564","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Limited Feedback in Power Allocation Design for a Two-Hop Relay OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Power system relaying","OFDM","Relays","Peer to peer computing","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","MIMO","Array signal processing","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation coding","OFDM modulation","radio links","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation design","two-hop relay","channel side information","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","codebook vectors","complexity reduction","Lloyd algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using Limited Feedback in Power Allocation Design for a Two-Hop Relay OFDM System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5199558/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10815114","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Limited Feedback in Power Allocation Design for a Two-Hop Relay OFDM System","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"11-23-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089716S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199561,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In general, the set of rates achievable by linear precoding and treating interference as noise is nonconvex. As a result, the corresponding utility maximization problem is nonconvex. The rate region can be convexifled by time sharing, and the utility maximization over the convexifled region can be solved via Lagrange duality. Still, subproblems in the dual problem remain nonconvex. It is shown how all the aforementioned nonconvex problems can be solved to global optimality in the framework of monotonic optimization. Moreover, it is investigated to what extent utility is increased by time sharing. While all problems can be solved to global optimality, the resulting computational complexity is rather high, thus the proposed solution strategies mainly provide a benchmark for locally optimum, less complex methods. Numerical results demonstrate that a method which finds stationary points on the boundary of the rate region can provide close-to-optimum performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10814845","htmlLink":"/document/5199561/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Utility Maximization in the Multi-User MISO Downlink with Linear Precoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility Maximization in the Multi-User MISO Downlink with Linear Precoding","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"09-07-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122441S","chronDate":"14-18 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5198563","isNumber":"5198564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5198563","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5198564","articleId":"5199561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5199569,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Many approaches have been developed for the combination of complementary information coming from input images in order to create a new image where the informative content is more suitable for human visual or machine perception. Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) can realize a flexible multiscale, multi-direction, and shift-invariant image decomposition. As a result, when NSCT is introduced to image fusion, more information and better characteristics from the original images for fusion could be obtained. In this paper, NSCT is proposed when different registered source images are decomposed. Then with two distinct modes of fusion method in low-frequency and in high-frequency separately, the fused image will be obtained by inverse NSCT. Compared with the fusion method based on wavelet and other fusion methods, the experiments show that this approach can achieve better results than them.","doi":"10.1109/ESIAT.2009.523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESIAT.2009.523","startPage":"338","endPage":"341","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Environmental Science and Information Application Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5199613/5199614/05199704.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Environmental Science and Information Application Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5199614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform Based Image Fusion and Its Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform Based Image Fusion and Its Analysis","conferenceDate":"4-5 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5199704/","accessionNumber":"10815740","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199704/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform Based Image Fusion and Its Analysis","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3682c338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047892S","chronDate":"4-5 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5199613","isNumber":"5199614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5199613","xplore-issue":"5199614","articleId":"5199704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5199760,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Wen","affiliation":["Guilin College of Aerospace and Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Wen","id":"37889339800"},{"name":"Sun Shanlin","affiliation":["Guilin College of Aerospace and Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Shanlin","id":"37680958500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3682-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5199760","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"abstract":"Inter-Carriers Interference (ICI) caused by frequency offset can result in the performance loss of the OFDM system. Aiming at this problem, the method of All Phase FFT is proposed for reducing the ICI and estimating frequency offset (CFO). Since the ICI energy and signal energy both contribute coherently to the estimator, the algorithm generates extremely accurate estimates even when the offset is far too great to demodulate the data values.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Environmental Science and Information Application Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5199613/5199614/05199760.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"582","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Environmental Science and Information Application Technology","doi":"10.1109/ESIAT.2009.350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESIAT.2009.350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5199614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5199760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Frequency Offset Estimator Based on All-Phase FFT for OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Interference","Phase estimation","Interpolation","Sequences","Sun","Educational institutions","System performance","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","frequency estimation","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency offset estimator","all-phase FFT","OFDM systems","inter-carriers interference","ICI energy","signal energy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency Offset","Inter-carrier Interference (ICI)","All-Phase Frequency Offset Estimator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5199760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Frequency Offset Estimator Based on All-Phase FFT for OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5199760/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10815796","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","conferenceDate":"4-5 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Frequency Offset Estimator Based on All-Phase FFT for OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3682c579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077011S","chronDate":"4-5 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5199613","isNumber":"5199614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5199613","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5199614","articleId":"5199760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5199777,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Dao Ping","affiliation":["Dept. of Comput.
